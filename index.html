                              <span>It might not be a new game, but Sucker Punch has shown off some pretty nice looking merch for Sly Cooper&#x27;s 20th anniversary.


Sorry to say that the words &#x27;Sly Cooper&#x27; and &#x27;announcement&#x27; aren&#x27;t being paired together to reveal a surprise new title, but with the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary having taken place on September 23, Sucker Punch did have some merch to show off, including a print, a t-shirt, and a plush of everyone&#x27;s favourite sneaky raccoon.


The print is admittedly incredibly gorgeous, showing a cross section of a building with a tonne of wonderful details and references to the series. At the time of writing both  versions of the framed print are currently out of stock on the producer&#x27;s website (Cook &amp; Becker), as there were a limited number that were signed by artist Dev Madan, but it might be worth keeping an eye on anyway. But it is still available to pick up on the PlayStation Gear store.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 looks to be doing pretty well for itself, as the game&#x27;s player count on Steam has risen quickly following the release of Cyberpunk Edgerunners.


We probably all know by now that Cyberpunk 2077 didn&#x27;t exactly launch in an amazing state. Whether it was the glitches, or the much delayed current-gen version of the game, things didn&#x27;t really pan out until this year when the game actually saw a number of big fixes, and the current-gen version was actually released. Despite all of its problems though, at the time of writing Cyberpunk is sitting at a healthy 105,445 concurrent players (via SteamDB). Why? Through the power of anime, of course.


Cyberpunk Edgerunners, the anime spinoff of CD Projekt&#x27;s take on the franchise from everyone&#x27;s favourite Studio Trigger, launched last week, and has so far been pretty widely praised. And clearly fans have the Cyberpunk fever, because since the release of the anime, the average player count has been going up and up and up, hitting a peak of 122,376 players yesterday (September 24), which as PCGamesN points out is higher than The Witcher 3&#x27;s all time Steam peak of 103,329.

                              <span>Not sure if you remember that Detective Pikachu was even getting another game, but it is, and it looks like it not only still exists, but might even be out soon.


The original Detective Pikachu game for 3DS, the inspiration behind the 2019 film of the same name, was announced to be receiving a sequel for Switch shortly after the film came out. And then we just… have not heard a single thing about the sequel since. But an eagle-eyed user on Famiboards noticed a mention of the game on developer Johnathon Murphy&#x27;s LinkedIn page which suggests the game might not be too far off.


Famiboards user MetalLord shared a screenshot of Murphy&#x27;s LinkedIn page, a developer who&#x27;s been with Creatures Inc. since 2017 as a senior programer, a company that basically made all your favourite Pokémon spinoffs, and helps out on the main games. &quot;Using Unity/C#, worked on one unannounced project and one nearing release, Detective Pikachu 2,&quot; reads the section of Murphy&#x27;s experience at Creatures Inc.

                              <span>We&#x27;re finally going to get our first taste of the Super Mario Bros. film next month, as a teaser trailer is planned to premiere at New York Comic Con.


The official NYCC Twitter account announced earlier this week that the first teaser trailer for Nintendo and Illumination&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. would be shown off at the convention, October 6, 4pm EST. It also finally confirmed a release date of April 7, 2023, as it had previously only been confirmed for a Spring release, after having been delayed from the holiday season this year.


Paired with the announcement is a very simple poster showing the classic question mark block on a black background, providing an elegance that Mario is perhaps not deserving of. No other details were given about the teaser trailer, and the announcement certainly didn&#x27;t mention if we&#x27;re going to hear the voice of Mario himself, Chris Pratt.

Twitterer Shinobi602 - a games industry brand manager - found themselves intrigued enough by the sci-fi horror&#x27;s most recent promotional video that they texted the number that pops up in the latest trailer.

After texting the number, Shinobi received a mysterious video response. The secretive teaser flashes words like &quot;secrets, answers, ARCAS, lies&quot; and ends with a date: 29th September.

We also discovered that spin-off The Witcher: Blood Origin will premier &quot;this December&quot;, which is set to star Minnie Driver as the Narrator.

                              <span>They&#x27;ve been up, down, up, down, down, up, and down again, but right now, Dark Souls 3&#x27; PC servers are live once again.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following &quot;reports of an issue with online servers&quot;. Although the publisher described the situation as &quot;temporary&quot;, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said &quot;there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform&quot; and revealed that it was &quot;investigating the source of the problem&quot;, but the servers remained offline for several days.

                              <span>I had no idea how important shareware was, and arguably still is, to the gaming industry until today. To me, shareware represented the few games I managed to play for free throughout the &#x27;90s. In particular, Duke Nukem 3D at lunchtime at Rupert Loman&#x27;s house. (Rupert is the founder of Eurogamer/Gamer Network.) And there, in the corner of our screens, would be the little shareware reminder that we were playing an unregistered version of the game. But that wasn&#x27;t a problem, it was legit, it wasn&#x27;t pirated. We could keep playing for as long as we wanted. It&#x27;s just that if we wanted more levels than the opening one, around the cinema - with the toilets you could wee into and the mirrors that actually reflected you (wow!) - then we&#x27;d have to pay for it. And I don&#x27;t think any of us ever did.


But that was shareware: finding stuff for free. Or, at least, that&#x27;s what it represented to me - I now realise I might have been part of the problem. But I was a teenager! I was broke. That&#x27;s why I got sucked into Dope Wars with all of my other MSN Messenger buddies in 1998, buying and selling drugs at very competitive market prices (in a game!), and how I found an RPG called Dink Smallwood, which I remember vividly to this day. Does anyone else? I&#x27;m genuinely curious.


Really, though, shareware began a long, long time ago, though it can still be seen today (whisper it: &quot;freemium&quot;). And I learnt this from a new book called Shareware Heroes, written by Richard Moss. It attempts the daunting task of presenting a history of shareware by telling the stories of all the people involved in it. That&#x27;s the equivalent of trying to follow all the separate threads in a bowl of spaghetti. But Moss, admirably, manages it.

                              <span>Renting games as a kid was frequently the only way I could play many new games. I was lucky that I&#x27;d typically receive a game for my birthday and for Christmas, but the rest of the year, games were expensive and out of reach through any other method than renting. It was the 1990s and the idea of cheap digital downloads to stave off the lack of games seemed unfathomable. 


The advantage to renting games is I had the opportunity to experience many more games than I ever would have risked asking for as a gift. The disadvantage? The competition involved in acquiring the game I was after.


That was the case with not-quite-Zelda-clone-but-it-is-basically Story of Thor on the Mega Drive. In many ways, competing for a copy of Story of Thor, also known as Beyond Oasis, was harder than actually playing the game. My local Blockbuster (remember those? No? Oh) had two copies. It looked thrilling. It had one of those newer Mega Drive boxes that had a thick blue line down the side of it. On the one hand, that meant that the game would have superior graphics and other bits and pieces. On the other hand, that meant the Mega Drive was getting a bit long in the tooth and my days of owning the latest console were very numbered. To put it into context, in Europe, Story of Thor came out the same year as the PlayStation 1 launched. Change was coming. Fast.

                              <span>This article originally went out to Eurogamer supporters as part of the Eurogamer Essentials newsletter that goes to all members every Friday. If you&#x27;d like to find out how to become a Eurogamer supporter you can find out more here.

If&#x27; there&#x27;s anything as fascinating is the incubation of a triple-A game - something exposed in spectacular fashion last weekend by the GTA 6 drama, with leaks that stripped away the gloss and exposed the wheels and cogs (as well as the ignorance of how exactly video games are made, something we could all do a better job of educating each other on) - it&#x27;s the afterlife of a modern-day blockbuster. Even better when it&#x27;s one as derided as Cyberpunk 2077 was at launch. 
Why exactly CD Projekt&#x27;s sci-fi spectacular was the subject of such ire when it launched at the tail-end of 2020 is a topic too multifaceted to properly unpick with the 600 or so words we have here; there was some righteous anger about the appalling working conditions Cyberpunk 2077 was made under at times, a hype cycle that even the most accomplished of games would buckle under, a more than messy launch as it awkwardly straddled two generations of hardware and, ultimately, a good old-fashioned pile-on that obscured all else. There’s rarely room for nuance in internet discourse, and the noise around Cyberpunk 2077’s launch is proof perfect of that.

                              <span>Welcome to the first weekend of autumn, gang! Scarves on necks, cocoa on stoves, leaves on ground. Chat about the weather might seem trite but what other conversation topic covers matters directly impacting your life today without risking causing a disagreement, years of simmering resentment, or a brawl? &quot;What are you having for dinner?&quot; is another good one, I think. Perhaps you&#x27;ll find this advice helpful if you&#x27;re attending EGX this weekend. Oh, I know another one: what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>It&#x27;s weekend two of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 beta - and now PC, PlayStation and Xbox players are all getting stuck in, cheaters have entered the battlefield.

And, in response, console players are disabling crossplay in a bid to avoid matching up with those on PC - the platform believed to have the most trouble with hackers.


If it sounds like you&#x27;ve read this story before, it&#x27;s because the same thing happened with the beta for last year&#x27;s Call of Duty Vanguard and 2020&#x27;s Black Ops Cold War.

Knight&#x27;s departure from Twitch means the firm has lost its chief content officer, chief operating officer, and Knight&#x27;s position in the last year alone (thanks, Bloomberg).

In a joint statement, the partnership said that despite 1.3 billion women and girls making up half of the global game&#x27;s community – 60 per cent of whom started gaming before turning 13 – 60 per cent of &quot;girl gamers&quot; polled by Dove &quot;feel misrepresented and recognise a lock of diversity as a key issue in video games&quot;.

35 per cent of young girls also reported that their &quot;self-esteen is negatively impacted after seeing a lack of diversity in characters and avatars&quot;.

Ninja Theory was named by GLHF as a company that utilises the services of Altered AI, a tech firm that supports studios in creating &quot;compelling, professional voice performances&quot; via AI rather than professional – and real – voice actors. 

The report stopped short of revealing the minutiae of the arrangement, however, stating that &quot;the details of their partnership are under wraps&quot;.

                              <span>The Outsiders and Funcon have released a behind-the-scenes (BTS) video showcasing how the rhythm FPS came to be. 

Exploring the &quot;origins of the game, including exclusive interviews with the game&#x27;s creators, music composers, and some of its amazing voice talent&quot;, the BTS documentary also includes conversations with the soundtrack creators, Elvira Björkman and Nicklas Hjertberg of Two Feathers.

You can check out the 15-minute video – which includes a sneaky peek at Two Feathers&#x27; &quot;huge live concert&quot; at Gamescom – below:

                              <span>PUBG Mobile has released a new anti-cheat system that it says has already cut cheating by half.

Developer Krafton says the system, called Fog of War, &quot;helps mask the movements of other players from cheaters using x-ray vision/wall hacks&quot;, and states that during the testing period, cheating fell by 62 per cent in &quot;certain regions&quot;.  

&quot;The first of its kind in mobile gaming, Fog of War is an advanced anti-cheat system that limits the game information a player receives, reducing their ability to see players out of their field of view or through walls and objects,&quot; Krafton explains.

                              <span>Life can be a lot less bother when you hover. Think of Exile, the 1988 marvel that cleverly crams an entire alien world and its belligerent fauna into the scrawny 32k memory of a BBC Micro. Chief among the game&#x27;s chaotic pleasures is its nifty jetpack, empowering your stranded space captain to explore the hostile planet Phoebus and its clever tangle of interlocking physics systems. 
As modes of transport go, jetpacks are often more about pluck than precision. In Exile you are engaged in a constant push-pull with unhelpful gas geysers, explosive shockwaves and the invisible tug of Phoebus gravity. But rocketing around at high speed in low-roofed caverns chimes perfectly with a game that asks you to jump headfirst into the unknown and apply seat-of-the-pants problem-solving. Exile&#x27;s rocket-powered emergent slapstick makes me smile the same way I do when seeing a jelly start to wobble: precariousness as pleasure. It is undoubtedly my second-favourite video game jetpack. (In keeping with the subject matter, please strap in and allow me to loop around in some discursive aerobatics before revealing my actual favourite.)
It is a boost universally acknowledged, then: jetpacks rule. They have ruled since the early 20th century, when they first propelled space cowboys like Buck Rogers into high adventure via lowbrow pulp novels and comic strips. For decades these portable domesticated explosions were sleek symbols of a seemingly imminent tech-assisted future, gleaming pointers toward a world where humanity would be free to blast off at will into the Y-axis while flicking V-signs at boring old gravity.

                              <span>Sly Cooper developer Sucker Punch has lifted the lid on a new line of merchandise to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.


This range consists of a Sly plushy (seen in the header image), a print of some anniversary artwork by the original Sly Cooper&#x27;s art director Dev Madan and an anniversary T-shirt.


The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

                              <span>A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week&#x27;s offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn&#x27;t Ark: Survival Evolved&#x27;s first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you&#x27;re a survival fan who hasn&#x27;t yet given it a look, it&#x27;s still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark&#x27;s base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic&#x27;s freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game&#x27;s rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

This sees fourteen Black Xbox employees offering up advice to others that are looking to get into the industry. Each will share insight into their jobs, as well as revealing some of their own career highlights.

Creative director Davide Soliani was initially told Rabbids were not to speak by Ubisoft. However, thanks to some creative manipulation of the rules and a successful bid by Soliani to &quot;gain trust&quot; from Ubisoft, Mario and his Rabbid companions will now talk during their upcoming escapades (thanks, IGN).


Let&#x27;s rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

&quot;Recently, we have seen increased harassment of our development team,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We welcome community input, however, the line between constructive feedback and the harassment of our dev team cannot be crossed.&quot;


&quot;We want to remind our players that we have a zero tolerance policy for threats and the harassment of our developers,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;We will take appropriate action to ensure the healthy and safety of our team&quot;.

Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


&quot;Neil Druckmann?&quot; my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

                              <span>Dicebreaker Recommends is a series of monthly board game, RPG and other tabletop recommendations from our friends at our sibling site, Dicebreaker. This month, we look at a one of the best two-player board games released in recent memory. 
There&#x27;s nothing quite like a two-player board game to stoke the fires of competition. Two-player board games are great in that they offer the kind of uniquely competitive experience that no other type of tabletop title can provide - and Sobek: 2 Players is a prime example of this.  
A recent remake/reimagining of a 2010 card game, Sobek: 2 Players takes the concept of the original – players are merchants attempting to make a tidy profit in an Ancient Egyptian market – and turns it into a more focused version, ditching the two to four-player count for a one-on-one experience.

                              <span>Valve has introduced a new, live, charts page on Steam.


As you may have surmised from the headline already, this page sees all of Steam&#x27;s top games bundled together in one place. It will replace the usual Steam Stats many of you may be familiar with.


&quot;Today we&#x27;re launching Steam Charts, a new section of Steam that is dedicated to showing the most-played and top-selling games on Steam. Including numbers in real time,&quot; Valve said in a statement (thanks, Kotaku).

                              <span>Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase&#x27;s plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It&#x27;s in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an &#x27;isometric/top-down&#x27; perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico&#x27;s National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can&#x27;t be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do &quot;love exploring&quot;. The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

                              <span>The GTA Forum, where this week&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto leaks occurred, has suggested the leak may have been the work of more than one person.


The initial leaker is known as Teapot and used the account @teapotuberhacker, but the forum believes another user, with the moniker Lily, also had access to this account.


It’s unclear whether this second user has access to any hacked material, though the forum believes this is not the case.

                              <span>Hello! Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we&#x27;ve found ourselves playing over the last few days. This time: trombones, pirates, and outer space.
If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
I haven&#x27;t laughed so hard at a game in a long time. Trombone Champ is hilarious. It&#x27;s everything the legendary melodica cover of the Jurassic Park theme tune is and more. And it&#x27;s hard enough trying to play it without struggling to breathe while laughing. This is rhythm action comedy at its finest.

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don&#x27;t usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it&#x27;s a fun silly idea; 2) it&#x27;s very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It&#x27;s a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn&#x27;t frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

                              <span>Steam now has a fancy charts section that shows the top selling and most played games in real time. If you want a broader picture of what’s trending on Valve’s storefront then you can check out the new weekly rankings of top sellers, along with the top new releases each month. It’s a useful way of seeing what’s trending across the platform if you’re really into that kind of thing.

If you signed up to the alpha anytime in the past few months since the game was announced then you might want to keep an eye on your emails for an invite. The FPS is currently only playable on PC, but the Hyenas team have said that’s set to change in the near future.

Ubisoft Toronto are looking for a scriptwriter for the new Splinter Cell, which they say uses the original as a “foundation” and aims at a “new audience of Splinter Cell fans”. I hate to break it to you Ubisoft, but I’m not certain that the kids dig Tom Clancy military espionage hijinks.

You’ll have to wait until 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST to find out who the next fighter is, according to a tweet from the MultiVersus team.

Kindly, they&#x27;re going to check in across the day, texting us all with updates on what they&#x27;re seeing, doing, and (I imagine) eating. And Ollie might join in from home with cat photos.

                              <span>A 17 year old was arrested in Oxfordshire yesterday, due to the suspicions of hacking. According to journalist Matthew Keys and sources who spoke to them, they were allegedly involved in the GTA 6 hack that resulted in a major information leak last weekend, and are also connected to a prior hack on Uber. This source also claims that the arrest was made by London City police in collaboration with the FBI.
In terms of information that has been confirmed, the London City Police has come forward and announced an arrest has been made in Oxfordshire as part of an ivnestigation by the NCA UK&#x27;s National Cyber Crime Unit. Currently in police custody, there is currently no confirmation made by the police whether they were arrested for the GTA 6 hack, although according to journalist Matthew keys an additional statement by the London City Police will be released later today. A statement from the FBI may also be released soon.
The hacker responsible for the GTA 6 had earlier in the week publicised that they were looking to make a &quot;deal&quot; with Rockstar (thanks Gamebyte), but since then things have gone quiet. Rockstar Games did come out to confirm that the leaked assets were legitimate, leading to an influx of industry support and numerious other devs posting their own early game builds to show that the GTA 6 that the world could see thanks to the leaks wasn&#x27;t likely to resemble the final product.

                              <span>While everyone knows that Classic World of Warcraft is undergoing a heap of hype surrounding the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, for good reason too, there are plenty of reasons to get excited, Brewfest is a great opportunity for loot and laughs right now. It is, however, also an opportunity for cheeky people to try and scam some extra loot from under the noses of their fellow adventurer. Such are the joys of Classic WoW.
But first, what is Brewfest. For those not in the know, Brewfest is a one-per-year limited time event where players can buy some drinks, get smashes, and get some exclusive rewards. It’s unsubtly based on the German holiday Octoberfest, and features a variety of events and tasks for players to complete if they so wish.
It also has a special boss fight — Corren Direbrew — in the Blackrock Depths, which in turn can provide some truly illustrious loot. These could be powerful trinkets, special toys that allow quick transfer to the dungeon, and even two very rare mounts with roughly a 1% drop-rate from Corren. Since right now players are gearing up characters for the next expansion, an even greater number of players than usual are jumping in for a chance at some handy shinies in this already bustling activity.

                              <span>Back in the 16 and 64-bit eras, UK-based developer Rare was exceptionally good at looking at what its then almost-parent Nintendo was doing, then developing their own killer take on it. I mean, seriously, look at the evidence – Diddy Kong Racing gives Mario Kart 64 a run for its money, but is awash with way, way more content. Banjo Kazooie is right up there with Super Mario 64. And one of the great pieces of gaming gossip of the 90s revolves around Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto’s alleged distaste at the wild success of Donkey Kong Country. Rare and Nintendo were on the same side, but were in a quiet sort of rivalry that resulted in some really damn good games. 

Star Fox Adventures is another game in that pantheon – and as I reconsidered this unique little tile as it turns 20 years old, I realized two things: first, the march of time is crushing and I feel ancient. Second: this is sadly the last great Star Fox game, at least for now.
Which is funny when you think about it, as Star Fox Adventures didn’t even begin life as a Star Fox game. It was originally announced as Dinosaur Planet, an original Rare property that was basically the company doing for the Ocarina of Time formula what Banjo-Kazooie did to Mario 64’s take on 3D platforming. It starred dual protagonists, a fox and a wolf, but after Miyamoto saw the game in action, he made a suggestion: why didn’t it just use Star Fox? Thus the game changed forms, and then platform – jumping from a surprisingly complete N64 build to a massive do-over on GameCube.

                              <span>Having kids is wonderful when it&#x27;s not the most tiring, life-changing thing you can do to yourself – and even then you only remember the wonderful bits. When your child smiles at you for the first time and it isn&#x27;t a build up of gas... wonderful. When your child says &quot;dada&quot; not as part of a string of completely random sounds... wonderful. When your child laughs at you for doing something only they would laugh at... wonderful.
As I said, it&#x27;s not always wonderful. Waking up four times a night... not wonderful. Standing in a stress position to hold the hands of a tiny child trying to walk... not wonderful (but also wonderful). Constantly tidying things that are never actually tidy... not wonderful.
But if there&#x27;s one thing that sums up having young children it&#x27;s this: It&#x27;s 4pm on a Saturday. Essentially the evening if you&#x27;re a parent. It&#x27;s a little too early for dinner, but you at least know that that&#x27;s soon and then after that bed time isn&#x27;t far off. The sweet release of bed time. Anyway, you see a crumb of chocolate just sat in a crevice of your shirt. Given that dinner, as established is still some minutes away, you fancy a small snack. Yum! Chocolate. But you&#x27;ve forgotten, just for a split-second, that you have a baby.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 Edgerunners shows everyone how a great anime tie-in should be done. With awesome animation and key aesthetic twinkles that ground the action in the Cyberpunk universe, there’s enough for newcomers to drink in while also letting franchise devotees nod sagely along to the show feeling very clever as it ticks off the all the cool things they’ve seen in-game – now that’s fan service. 


If adapting something beloved is difficult, then adapting something with a dodgy rep should be even harder.


For all its genuine merits, Cyberpunk 2077 overpromised, launched in an unacceptable state on console and bore the price – even my Mum asked me about it getting yanked from PlayStation after she heard about it on mainstream breakfast news.

                              <span>Valve has finally released a shiny new revamp of their old stats page, so that us data nerds can track the most popular, most financially lucrative, and most played PC games on Steam in one new webpage. Available for anyone and everyone right now, you no longer have to check out a dated site or third party alternatives.
Announced via a blog post earlier today, a variety of info on each game and their placement on respective rankings such as recent changes in position, options to quickly switch regional toggles, and the ability to see total revenue. All in all, a handy tool!
Those who have been around for a while, and people who have tried to look up this sort of information may have popped by the old stats page or websites like Steam Spy or Steam Charts (yes, there was a Steam Charts before this announcement, confusingly enough). It was possible to get a good idea of certain data points via these websites (some of which would pull information from the Steam API) That being said, having a new flashy place to grab this kind of data from an official source does make the process a whole lot easier.

                              <span>Please enjoy this self-indulgent vlog about my first day at an expo in over four years. I wasn’t planning to focus so much on Shadows of Doubt, and I will be doing a proper preview in the coming weeks, but I cannot stress this enough – it’s brilliant. Rarely does such a bold vision enjoy being matched by its execution. It reminds me somewhat of Cloudpunk, which I really enjoyed, but I desperately wanted to have a less passive relationship with the city itself. With it’s striking sense of immersion and a commitment to granular interactivity built into the game’s core design, I feel like Shadows of Doubt very much achieves that aspiration for me. I can’t wait until the full version comes out next year. It won ‘UK Game of the Show’ at Gamescom a few weeks ago, and it’s blindingly obvious why …</span>

                              <span>The Modern Warfare 2 beta kicked off its second stint last night across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Though it&#x27;s the second time PlayStation players are able to play, this is the first time PC and Xbox folks are getting access to the beta.
It&#x27;s only available for those who pre-ordered or acquired a beta code so far, but it&#x27;s already breaking records.
Everyone assumed it was going to be big, but since Call of Duty has been absent from Steam for five years now, we never really had a good picture of its player numbers on PC. Modern Warfare 2 marks the series&#x27; grand return to Steam, and the audience there has responded in kind.

                              <span>World of Warcraft Classic is getting a massive update with the Wrath of the Lich King expansion on September 26. It’s a bit of a big deal, especially for the thousands of players who have been grinding out Alterac Valley or farming professions over the past few weeks. To celebrate the occasion, a new trailer has been released on the official World of Warcraft Youtube channel, and it’s absolutely perfect.
You can watch it yourself below, but for some context this wasn’t created by the usual team of talented CGI artists who put out stunning cinematics for expansions (like the excellent Dragon Isle trailer). Instead, it comes from fan creator Hurricane, who has previously been responsible for a range of custom mind-blowing raid trailers.
In the trailer, you can see all the major features of the Wrath of the Lich King launch, including the scourge invasion of Azeroth, players arriving to the various Northrend zones and battling various monsters you can find there, taking on dungeons and of course some Wintergrasp PvP. All of this is a machinima, made with a variety of in-game assets and custom VFX. For an idea of the sort of work that goes into trailers like this, you can check out a short breakdown video of a previous Black Temple trailer here!

                              <span>Years ago, it was customary that some of us stated publicly the way we
think in time of Debian General Resolutions (GRs). And even if we
didn’t, vote lists were open (except when voting for people,
i.e. when electing a DPL), so if interested we could understand what
our different peers thought.
This is the first vote, though, where a Debian vote is protected under
voting secrecy. I think
it is sad we chose that path, as I liken a GR vote more with a voting
process within a general assembly of a cooperative than with a
countrywide voting one; I feel that understanding who is behind each
posture helps us better understand the project as a whole.
But anyway, I’m digressing… Even though I remained quiet during much
of the discussion period (I was preparing and attending a conference),

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing video game leaks, following last weekend&#x27;s devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

After that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an &quot;insider&quot; Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft. Join Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan for their thoughts.

                              <span>As Microsoft starts to feel more heat from regulatory bodies over its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, CEO Satya Nadella has said he&#x27;s &quot;very confident” the deal will go through.


Governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition has grown in recent weeks, with the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority announcing it was moving to a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; of its investigation, having determined the acquisition would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


Sony, too, has grown increasingly vocal over the proposed deal, particularly as it pertains to potential console exclusivity around the likes of Call of Duty. Early this month, for instance, PlayStation head Jim Ryan called Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances that the hugely popular shooter would remain on PS5 post-acquisition &quot;inadequate&quot;.

                              <span>One of the most integral parts to any good FIFA game, aside from the football, is the soundtrack.


A running theme around the FIFA community is that every new game introduced players to their next favourite tune. And as the years go by, the tracks serve as a nostalgia trip to playing FIFA after a long day of school or work. 


Now EA has revealed the full track list for FIFA 23, and you can stream it all now in a dedicated Spotify playlist.

Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2&#x27;s five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the &quot;epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour&quot;. Here, they&#x27;ll find &quot;challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover.&quot;


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

Grand Theft Auto IV - Definitive Edition is a project which complied a number of mods which aimed to enhance and update the game to run on modern PCs (thanks, PC Gamer). 


The game was last updated by Rockstar in 2020, when the developer removed the archaic Games for Windows Live DRM after it was shut down by Microsoft. However, this also had the unfortunate effect of disabling access to online multiplayer and leaderboards, which were run through the GFWL backend.

This listing (spotted by PSU) is for a scriptwriter and reads: &quot;Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience&quot;.


The post goes on to state that Ubisoft intends to &quot;keep the spirit and themes of the original game&quot; with this remake while &quot;exploring [its] characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable.&quot;

                              <span>The Innocn 40C1R is a 40-inch ultrawide monitor with an IPS-style panel, AMD Freesync Premium and a 144Hz refresh rate - all standard stuff, right? What makes this monitor unique though is its form factor: the 40C1R is completely flat, making it a tempting alternative for folks that don&#x27;t appreciate the curved screens endemic amongst modern ultrawides. You don&#x27;t pay a premium for this either, with the 40C1R being surprisingly affordable given its titanic proportions: $600 is the list price, with the price dipping to $480 or less during sales. 
I first ran into Innocn earlier this year, when I sampled one of their portable OLED monitors - which I felt delivered a nice combination of portability and image quality with all the benefits of OLED technology. The 40C1R is not an OLED display and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of LCD technology, so I was skeptical, but I figured I&#x27;d see how it stacks up against my own similarly-sized LG 38GN950 monitor and whether it&#x27;s a suitable choice for PC gamers looking for a sizable panel at a decent price. 
Once you unbox the 40C1R, the first thing that stands out is the understated design. Devoid of the typical ostentatious gaming-oriented elements so common in PC monitors, the 40C1R is restrained with a modest, thin black bezel, a clean rectangular stand and a small lip running along the bottom of the frame housing the controls. It&#x27;s a nice-looking monitor that&#x27;ll look good on just about any desk - well, any desk that can handle its girth, at least.

                              <span>The brilliant Spiritfarer will soon become available to play via the Netflix phone app. 


If you&#x27;re yet to try it, Spiritfarer is a memorable and moving adventure game where you shepard a crew of lost souls into the after life, while slowly upgrading your boat.


In a nutshell, it&#x27;s a &quot;cosy management game about dying&quot;, and one of my favourite games from 2020. If this news means more people get to play it - all the better!

                              <span>Nintendo preservation site Forest of Illusion, in collaboration with Render Archive and NintendoWarden, have uncovered what appears to be a cut stage from Super Mario 64. 


The screenshot reel from a pre-release build of the game was found in the long-sought after 1996 Nintendo Company Report. 


The report, which has been carefully scanned and uploaded here, includes the standard yearly company round-up, plus some accompanying images of Nintendo&#x27;s star roster and various consoles including the Nintendo 64 and the destined for failure Virtual Boy.

                              <span>Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth has been delayed until December.


Lenneth is an enhanced version of the original 1999 PS1 RPG Valkyrie Profile that was released on PSP in 2007 - its first release in the PAL region.


It was set for a re-release alongside the forthcoming action-RPG Valkyrie Elysium, available both separately and included in the deluxe edition, but now will arrive a little later.

                              <span>Return to Monkey Island has just come out, and the reception to it has been overwhelmingly positive. This reception has, of course, not been missed by those at Lucasfilm Games, or more specifically, Craig Derrick who worked with Ron Gilbert and co to get the game released. 


Now, Derrick has shared his delight at all the positive feedback for Return to Monkey Island in a heartfelt Twitter thread. 


This alone is nice but not especially newsworthy. However, at the end of his thread, Derrick wrote some simple words that have caught the world&#x27;s eye: &quot;I&#x27;ll be standing by when it&#x27;s time to go BACK TO THE MANSION!&quot;

                              <span>The adorable fox-themed Tunic is making the leap to PlayStation and Switch soon. Ahead of these releases, its developer has shared some behind the scenes titbits about the game&#x27;s manual, including how a real one was made to ensure authenticity within the game


Sharing on the PlayStation Blog, Tunic&#x27;s lead developer Andrew Shouldice expressed his love for old-school game&#x27;s manuals. &quot;The more I thought about it though, the more I realised that my love for this kind of mystery came not just from the games, but from the manuals they were packaged with,&quot; Shouldice wrote, stating he would &quot;pore over these documents endlessly&quot;.


Such was Shouldice&#x27;s love for these manuals, he decided to incorporate one into Tunic&#x27;s gameplay. In this case, the player picks up pages for the manual as they make their way through the game&#x27;s mysterious word. These are then pieced together, allowing the player to uncover more of Tunic&#x27;s many (many) secrets.

                              <span>The Grand Theft Auto community has started to map out the game world of the next GTA game using leaks as their source. 


We know very little about the next game from official channels, but the huge leak on Monday gave us our biggest (albeit unfinished) look at the title. 


Moreover, with various reports reporting on the game&#x27;s location, characters and gameplay elements, there appears to be enough to go on to start the mapping process.

                              <span>In the Secret Fountain levels, I fell in love with the water. I didn&#x27;t notice it at first. I was just digging downwards, flattening baddies with my shovel, enjoying the regular knockabout fun of a 2D platformer. But then I started getting hit by fish. Quite a lot of fish. Fish from the fish cannon, scarlet and slappy and properly doing me in. I realised that the fish moved across the water - they could travel wherever it flowed. And I realised that I could break blocks and channel the water where I wanted it to go. Maybe I could do more than just reroute the fish? What would happen if I steered the water over to that promising waterwheel?


Shovel Knight Dig is a fresh spin on the Shovel Knight series of Duck Tales-inspired platformers. Like Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, it&#x27;s sort of a sidestory. Pocket Dungeon turned the action-heavy core of the games into a block puzzler. Dig initially seems like a blend of Mr Driller and Downwell. You dig down through soil and rock, collecting gems, fighting baddies, travelling through themed worlds. Classic Driller/Downwell stuff. Thing is, it doesn&#x27;t feel like either game,


That&#x27;s because while Dig is a Shovel Knight game and a Yacht Club game, it&#x27;s also a Nitrome game - it&#x27;s a true collaboration. And here a little history is unavoidable. Nitrome is an English micro-studio founded in the early 2000s, and I first encountered the team&#x27;s stuff during the Flash/web-game boom in the years that followed. Nitrome was hard to miss: it delivered games that had a pixelart hard candy exterior - lots of hot pinks and mustards and purples. More importantly its games were marked by wild invention and polish.

                              <span>Valorant will now flag bad behaviour in its end of game screen in an attempt to curb toxicity.


A new update has been released for the game, focused predominantly on changes to the Pearl map.


Yet nestled in the patch notes is a social update to add a &quot;disruptive gameplay-based behaviour indicator&quot;.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia announced its next series of GeForce RTX cards - and raised eyebrows at how much some of them will cost.


At the top end, the RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1599. The RTX 4080 16GB will cost $1199, while the RTX 4080 12GB will cost $899.


Many had hoped for lower prices - but, according to Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, these costs reflect a world where Moore&#x27;s law - where performance is doubled for half the price every two years - is now &quot;dead&quot;.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s long-awaited new chapter is getting closer to its release - but it could have once been very different.
What we&#x27;re getting is a DLC package known as the Winters Expansion, which will include a third-person mode for the base game, a rework of the Mercenaries Mode which will introduce new playable characters such as Lady Dimitrescu, and the new story-based chapter known as Shadows of Rose.


Shadows of Rose will put Ethan Winters&#x27; daughter into the spotlight as she makes her way through the  consciousness of the Megamycete. This, Capcom has said, will conclude the Winters family story. However, Rose was not always going to be the focus of this story DLC. Instead, Capcom also had ideas for a Chris Redfield focused expansion.

Thankfully, Microsoft has heard your calls - over the noise of their own Xbox consoles, presumably - and is implementing an option to mute startup sounds entirely. Yes, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that Xbox swoosh to shoosh.


The choice of a silent startup is available now to those in Microsoft&#x27;s Alpha test ring for Xbox system software, meaning everyone else will likely follow suit within the next month.

Speaking at GI Live: London (thanks GamesIndustry.biz), Yoshida discussed Sony&#x27;s approach to a subscription service, reiterating that the company still believes in the &quot;premium release of a title at launch&quot;.



Yet with PS Plus, Sony is offering a different approach as added value to developers and publishers.

The announcement comes after a steady increase in player count for Cyberpunk 2077. Previously, numbers for the game on Steam were on the rise, making it one of Steam&#x27;s top single-player games.

                              <span>Cyberpunk Edgerunners is fantastic, the latest in a recent line of impressive anime adaptations of video games. I’ve enjoyed the low-level shenanigans of its eclectic cast of sci-fi punks as they navigate the never-ending dystopia that is Night City. It presents a story more heartfelt than Cyberpunk 2077’s, with more likeable characters (not hard, when you consider the relentless - and inescapable - dickheadishness of Keanu Reeve’s Johnny Silverhand). Edgerunners, though, offers a slither of hope, and not just for its fictional characters. It shows CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk is still worth fighting for, despite everything.

CYBERPUNK 2077 SPOILERS ARE AHEAD.


I thought it impossible at first. Cyberpunk 2077’s launch was a car crash as catastrophic as any of the viral glitches the game spat out from some overloaded Night City crossroads. I had thought CD Projekt would fulfil its legal obligations and move on, like a cruel corpo washing their hands of a shady business deal gone wrong. Remember Witcher? Please, remember Witcher!

                              <span>Isaac Newton was once moved to put a bodkin, or large, blunt sewing needle, behind his eye. Where exactly? (I feel you would want to be exact about this.) &quot;Betwixt my eye and bone as neare to [the] backside of my eye as I could.&quot; This is quite a thing to do to yourself, but Newton was fixated. 


Newton was fixated with phosphenes, the frantic scattering light displays that erupt when you press your palms to your eyes and bother the optic nerve. Light from darkness: you can see why such an imbalance would have made Newton a bit grumpy. But also the wonder of it: these scrolling, tunneling, chequerboard passageways that seem to open up between you and the world around you. Magic.


Would Isaac Newton have liked Hyper Demon? I will leave this to others to judge. But Hyper Demon certainly loves phosphenes. This implausibly fast score-chasing micro-shooter coats its enemies in the shimmering, strobing pinks and dirty golds that phosphenes like to trade in. It wraps everything in a fish-eye lens, the queasiest of all lenses, just to give you that extra sense of being trapped deep within something, subdermal or far beneath the oceans. Horned skulls, praying hands, glittering diamonds that shatter on impact. Forget Newton, Hyper Demon makes me realise what a shame it is that Hieronymus Bosch never did a season for Juicy Couture.

                              <span>Developer Asobo has released its latest Sim Update for the majestic Microsoft Flight Simulator, this one bringing, among other things, long-awaited DLSS support for PC.


Alongside DLSS anti-aliasing and upscaling, Asobo says Sim Update 10 should deliver &quot;stability, performance, and memory usage&quot; improvements for those using Flight Simulator&#x27;s in-development Direct X12 support - although it notes the new memory allocator will only be activated once Nvidia&#x27;s next GPU driver is released.


Elsewhere in today&#x27;s update, moving boats in the world now have a wake effect on PC, there&#x27;s a new cloud layer system - said to provide &quot;more vertical precision at low altitudes to better reflect the various cloud altitudes and thickness close to the ground&quot; - plus a number of quality of life features for Flight Simulator&#x27;s VFR map.

                              <span>The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team&#x27;s play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it&#x27;s clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet&#x27;s original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

                              <span>Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a &#x27;lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

                              <span>Nvidia stuck to the high-end goods for their GeForce RTX 40 series announcement, revealing their next graphics card generation with only the premier RTX 4090 and two flavours of RTX 4080. All three are coming soon with varying degrees of price bumps over the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, though Nvidia reckon the performance and feature improvements of the 40 series’ Ada Lovelace architecture will make them worthy investments. Especially with the aid of DLSS 3, a new and significantly upgraded version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler that will only work with RTX 40 series GPUs at launch.

CD Projekt have revealed in a tweet that the game has seen one million players every day this week so far, across all platforms. They say this figure includes players new to Night City, as well as those returning. I’ve never played it, so don’t look at me.

What pretty birds they are! Oh, and they&#x27;re cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character ended up in superhell.

                              <span>Indie rhythm game Trombone Champ released on Steam last week, and it deserves a round of applause for its sheer commitment to the brass majesty of the ‘bone. Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it&#x27;s the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner. If you haven’t already witnessed the game in action then please do yourself a favour and watch the trailer below.

FromSoftware confirmed that PvP multiplayer for the Steam version of the game had gone offline in a tweet, and said they’d provide an update once details were available to share. When I published this post, no explanation was forthcoming about what the cause of the downtime might be.

                              <span>Have you ever played a game and thought, &quot;Are we actually the bad guys here?&quot; Usually, the whole &quot;we&#x27;re fighting on the wrong side of history&quot; line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you&#x27;ve achieved so far. I don&#x27;t say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you&#x27;re looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there&#x27;s an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they&#x27;re, err, pro democracy. Of the cast&#x27;s central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he&#x27;s repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, &quot;Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.&quot; It&#x27;s an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

                              <span>Solium Infernum – the cult classic turn-based strategy PC game that astounded players when it landed back in 2009 – is finally making its return in 2023, per a new trailer released by developer League of Geeks at EGX this week.
The demonic turn-based experience is coming back for modern gamers, and it&#x27;s got a new developer attached this time around – it&#x27;s been reimagined by Armello creators, League of Geeks, and will arrive complete with all-new single-player scenarios and scheme-in-your-sleep asynchronous multiplayer matches, to boot.

As with the original release, the new game will require you to deploy cunning moves and political wit in order to outplay your opponents and reign supreme. The game has been modernized and built in 3D with a totally updated visual interface, bringing in the lessons League of Geeks has learned from Armello when it comes to &quot;unique and acclaimed aesthetic and production values&quot;.

                              <span>That Ted Lasso’s AFC Richmond are in FIFA 23 is fun enough, but despite the team favouring good vibes over skills in the show, in-game some of the main characters&#x27; stats have to be seen to be believed. 


Over the last few days, EA Sports has been releasing the new ratings for top players around the world. But with the full game now just a week away, you can see the full database of stats for every player online. 


Joining the likes of the Classic XI and MLS All-Stars in the Rest of the World league, AFC Richmond has an average overall rating of 78, putting them between Wolves and Everton in the mid-table mush of the Premier League.

                              <span>Return to Monkey Island has a lot of tricks up its sleeve. The greatest trick it manages to play, however, is to pick up where Monkey Island 2 left off, 30 years prior, and do so while feeling entirely natural. Not a beat is missed, not a shred of strange discomfort. It just works. Older players will slide into this game’s embrace like an old, battered sofa. And it feels like home.

It has other tricks, however. Return to Monkey Island isn’t the third Monkey Island game in truth, of course – but it’s the third from series creator Ron Gilbert. Return has things to say about the canon of the series, given this presents itself as the third Monkey Island game despite being the sixth to actually hit store shelves.
There’s a neat subtext throughout about what stories really mean to us all. The decades between Monkey Island 2 and this new story has clearly given Gilbert time to reflect on the originals, the games which are likely to headline his epitaph regardless of what he does in the future – and the end result is fascinating and heartening.

Never thought I’d be playing a new Monkey Island. I’m also loving the new art direction it took, it’s so fresh.

                              <span>In June I travelled to see Nine Inch Nails perform two nights at the Eden
Project in Cornwall. It&#x27;d been eight
years since I last saw them live and when they announced
the Eden shows, I thought it might be the only chance I&#x27;d get to see them for a
long time. I committed, and sods law, a week or so later they announced a
handful of single-night UK club shows. On the other hand, on previous tours
where they&#x27;d typically book two club nights in each city, I&#x27;ve attended one
night and always felt I should have done both, so this time I was making that
happen.

                              <span>Developer Jupiter has unveiled an eighth mainline instalment for its mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, its big new addition being multiplayer support for up to four player when it launches next week. Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.


Picross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.


According to the official Picross website, it&#x27;s local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there&#x27;s a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate.

                              <span>Gearbox has called the release of Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands a &quot;great victory&quot; for the studio, saying its success means it &quot;now clearly [has] a new franchise on its hands&quot;, with more &quot;experiences&quot; already in development.


Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands released back in March, taking the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and building it out into a full-length game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


It was generally well-received by critics at launch - Eurogamer called it &quot;endearing&quot; despite its &quot;hodgepodge design&quot; - and it appears to have been enough of a commercial success that Gearbox is now eager to do more.

                              <span>A month after Dark Souls 3&#x27;s Steam servers were finally bought online following more than seven months of downtime, they&#x27;re offline again, with publisher Bandai Namco confirming it&#x27;s currently &quot;investigating&quot; the issue.


The Dark Souls server woes began in January, when Bandai Namco was forced to disable servers for all Dark Souls games following reports of serious security concerns. Although the publisher described the situation as &#x27;temporary&#x27; at the time, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August.


Unfortunately, the celebrations have been short-lived, and the game&#x27;s PvP servers are once again unavailable, preventing players from accessing any of its online features.

Customisation options for the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2&#x27;s Xbox button can be found in the latest version of the Xbox Accessories app on console and PC while a controller is connected. Here, users can visit the Colour tab to tinker with the Xbox button&#x27;s brightness, or use the menu sliders to pick one out of a possible 16 million hues.


In addition to button customisation, September&#x27;s Xbox update brings a revamp to the &#x27;My games and apps&#x27; Full library view on consoles, streamlining access to all games available to install and play. Furthermore, &#x27;All games&#x27; now displays every title a user has access to, including those on Game Pass, EA Access, and those claimed via Games with Gold.

The claim follows months of legal back and forth between cheat seller AimJunkies and Destiny developer Bungie, which has seen the former accused of both trademark and copyright infringement. 


AimJunkies has previously attempted to shrug off these claims, but has now gone one further. As reported by Torrentfreak, the cheat seller has now launched a countersuit which alleges Bungie accessed its computers for anti-cheat purposes via &quot;clandestine surveillance&quot; - effectively, that Bungie hacked it.

Call of the Sea - which initially launched for PC and consoles at the tail-end of 2020 - tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones), as she investigates a beautiful South Pacific island, circa 1934, in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully hits some powerful emotional beats even as it tips gently into cosmic weirdness.

It&#x27;s a music rhythm game where you play a trombone. Sounds simple, right?

You&#x27;d be wrong. Even though there&#x27;s some of the most famous classical pieces included, like Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, and even the national anthem, no amount of music knowledge will save you here.

Wingefors, whose company owns Saints Row developer Volition, acknowledged that views on the series&#x27; reboot had been &quot;polarised&quot; following its bug-laced release - in Eurogamer&#x27;s Saints Row review, Vikki Blake noted that its &#x27;Unto the Breach&#x27; mission was unplayable for her.


&quot;There are a lot of things that could be said and details around it. I&#x27;m happy to see a lot of gamers and fans happy. At the same time I&#x27;m a bit sad to see fans also not happy,&quot; Lars told investors (via Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo).

Writing on Twitter, the director of the ruling Taliban government&#x27;s media and information centre stated that the game would be blocked, alongside social app TikTok, for its effects on young people (thanks, PCGamesN). 


India, Pakistan, China and Jordan have also previously banned PUBG, whose mobile version specifically became particularly popular in these countries.

Players are tasked with documenting key animal behaviour to inform environmental research, mimicking that of natural history film-making researchers.

                              <span>Nvidia is releasing Portal with RTX, which will see the game&#x27;s graphics reimagined &quot;with full ray tracing and entirely new art evocative of the original.&quot;


In a detailed blog post, Nvidia stated that &quot;full ray tracing&quot; will mean every level will be transformed. Light will now bounce around the settings, and &quot;be affected by the scene&#x27;s geometry and materials&quot;. Meanwhile, where shadows are being cast, these will be &quot;pixel perfect&quot;.


&quot;Portal&#x27;s unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn&#x27;t been done before its release,&quot; Nvidia elaborated. &quot;With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step.&quot; You can see a little preview of Portal with RTX below.

&quot;Investigations found there was no evidence substantiating the allegations of this former employee who resigned in 2019. We stand against all forms of harassment and take any allegation extremely seriously. We support those who have concerns they wish to raise. We therefore took the necessary time to thoroughly investigate allegations at Rocksteady Studios with the utmost integrity. 
&quot;An external, independent law firm conducted a full and thorough investigation, including interviewing current and former employees, not only researching past allegations, but also examining the current culture of the studio. Furthermore, a Warner Bros. Discovery (then Warner Media) People Relations team, independent of the games division, diligently researched and investigated any allegations raised.

                              <span>New footage filmed on the show floor of E3 1999 has been posted on YouTube, and gives us one of the closest looks yet at the cut &quot;Perfect Head&quot; feature from N64 gem Perfect Dark.

Perfect Head would have allowed players to scan a face into the game using the camera on a Game Boy, which could then be mapped onto a multiplayer character&#x27;s head. The feature was complete and functional, but was removed from the game for its release. 

In an 2020 interview conducted by our own Wesley Yin-Poole, several of the developers revealed it had been removed at Nintendo&#x27;s request due to the recent Columbine High School massacre and concerns over the feature&#x27;s potential uses.

                              <span>A new and detailed report by Bloomberg has highlighted the numbers of children who stream on Twitch, and the number of accounts linked to adult predators who follow and interact with them.


Research includes various examples of children being asked by adult users to engage in explicit or inappropriate activities and perform dances or &quot;dares&quot; while live-streaming. After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.


The report suggests this is due to &quot;hundreds&quot; of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with &quot;more than 1000 kids on their following lists&quot;.

This series of images was shared on Reddit by user M_S_1.


M_S_1 said they took inspiration from the featured games&#x27; concept art for their covers, calling it &quot;a bit more timeless&quot; to work from. &quot;A character render with modern graphics would look pretty jarring for the era,&quot; they explained.

The revenue split between Twitch and streamers has long been an issue, with many claiming the current 50/50 split is stifling the growth of smaller channels.


The UserVoice post, begun by streamer SaltyWyvern in 2020, became the most voted issue on the platform as it requested Twitch change the revenue split to 70/30 (like main rival YouTube). This has now been closed by Twitch.

The highlight here is Infinity Ward&#x27;s explanation for Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s divisive mini-map, which has come under fire from some players for failing to provide enough information on enemy players.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their weapons.

Vlambeer co-founder Rami Ismail was among those who spoke out about the game, and who shared a detailed thread of criticism posted on ResetEra.


&quot;Why don&#x27;t you for once just hire some Arabs [and] locals to ensure the places you seem to insist you gotta blow us up in would at least pass the critical gaze of say, a three-year-old,&quot; Ismail wrote on Twitter. &quot;This is embarrassing to game development as a whole.&quot;

                              <span>An update to Spelunky 2 adds cross-play to its online multiplayer.


Now, Adventure Mode and Arena Mode are available to play online with friends or random players across PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC (Steam).


&quot;With that, I feel like all of our major goals for online multiplayer have been met, but to be clear, we will still be monitoring social channels for feedback and plan on making further improvements to the Spelunky 2 online experience,&quot; reads an update on the release of v1.26 from designer Derek Yu.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t believe this day would come. Almost 12 years have passed since Trails from Zero&#x27;s Japanese launch and many JRPG fans had given up on the idea of an official western release. We had fan translations, sure, and while Trails fans know localisation waiting pains all too well, Zero and its sequel felt destined to remain out of reach. Until last year&#x27;s announcement, that is. NIS America did what many had thought impossible, and personally I could not be happier.


My own journey with Trails began in 2020. Having finished Ys VIII, a friend recommended Trails of Cold Steel and a year later – Reverie and Kuro aside – I&#x27;d finished the wider series. Considering Kuro No Kiseki&#x27;s just kicked off the second half when there were 10 games before it, you can appreciate the sense of scale we&#x27;re w…</span>

                              <span>Co-operative time-travel puzzler The Past Within - the latest entry in developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s wonderfully sinister puzzle-adventure series - finally has a release date and will be coming to PC, Mac, iOS, and Android on 2nd November.


Developer Rusty Lake has released 14 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner to date - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - each delivering a deliciously surreal, narratively interconnected slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant.


The Past Within is Rusty Lake&#x27;s first attempt at a co-operative adventure, expanding the series&#x27; familiar formula, both spacially and temporally, as two players work together across different timelines - one located in the past, the other in the future - to solve the mysteries surrounding recurring series character Albert Vanderboom.

On seeing this leaked footage, some corners of the internet decided to use it as ammunition to criticise Rockstar&#x27;s unfinished work.


&quot;If you knew how game development goes, you&#x27;d know that visuals are one of the first things done. This game is four years into planning and development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get. The next year is mission coding and debugging. All backend stuff. It does look ass,&quot; claimed one Twitter user.

The new policy prohibits streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette, or dice games that aren&#x27;t licensed in the US or &quot;other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection&quot; from 18th October.


This follows strike threats from some of the biggest Twitch streamers after former Team Liquid member ItsSliker admitted to have scammed viewers and fellow streamers out of $200k to fund his gambling addiction.

                              <span>YouTuber John Allen, who accidentally outed himself as being behind a video games industry &quot;insider&quot; Twitter account, has issued an apology video in which he admits being motivated by &quot;clout&quot; and &quot;the buzz&quot;. 


Allen gained brief internet fame by leaking details of Ubisoft&#x27;s various Assassin&#x27;s Creed announcements - details which he had been given by Ubisoft itself to prepare content while under embargo.


But his identity as &quot;TheRealInsider&quot; was exposed over the weekend, when Allen replied to a tweet from a fan from his main account instead. Allen then swiftly deleted the tweet, the insider account, and subsequently issued a brief Twitter statement saying sorry.

                              <span>How do you stop people getting comfortable in a tower defence game? I think you know what I mean: that point where you&#x27;re deep into a game, your defences are well established, and anything that tries to get through this, your abattoir, is made mincemeat of. You, at that point, are effectively hands off, admiring what you&#x27;ve built, and all the game can do is bulk up the enemies and try to brute force its way through. But what if there was another way? 


Isle of Arrows has an idea: a second base. Just as you&#x27;re beginning to slouch and get comfortable, it introduces another base, and it&#x27;s like starting all over again but at the same time as managing something else. Only now, you have one pool of resources to spread across both bases. Even more importantly: both bases share the same overall health pool. If enemies get through to your core in either one, you&#x27;ll take damage, and as you only have about 10 hearts, and one life, this is important.


In other words, the danger is doubled, and if you ignore one base for the other, and allow a bad situation to fester, you could quickly find yourself in a precarious situation indeed.

                              <span>Though I hate to admit it, as a Final Fantasy fan, I never managed to play Crisis Core on its original PSP release as I never owned that particular handheld. I suspect, though, that I&#x27;m not alone, which is why it&#x27;s such a relief that Square Enix is now bringing the game to practically every current platform available.


I recently went hands on with a demo of this lengthily-titled remaster - Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion - and I&#x27;m excited to dive in properly on its release this December.



Questions remain over the impact Crisis Core will have on the forthcoming second part (Rebirth) of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, but what&#x27;s immediately clear from its remaster is how it&#x27;s now clearly positioned as a side story to Remake.

                              <span>Like many, my first thought upon seeing the GTA 6 leak was ‘fuck’. The second was a flashback to the protocols which had occurred when leaks or security breaches, no matter how minor, had happened when I was on the development side of the industry: usually, angry-faced men bursting into a room and demanding nobody touch anything. The third thought was what Rockstar, the king of image control and information flow, would do now. My mind ran to that sequence from The Bourne Identity, where an embattled CIA station chief demands the agency ‘get everybody up’. Everybody, in this instance, being a set of assassins, each with cool names and even colder intentions.   


To my knowledge, Matt Damon is not involved, and Rockstar’s brass has not dispatched Clive Owen to have a gun-point philosophical chat with the person responsible for this leak, much as it perhaps would like to. It has, however, teamed with the FBI, so maybe I wasn’t that far off. Either way, the response will be swift and all-encompassing, like what happened with the closest thing I can think of to this, the Half-Life 2 leak. (And we all know what happened there.)   


The reasons for such a response are obvious. There is a gigantic financial element in play here. There are security concerns regarding source code and other exposures which could well derail an entire project. And then there’s reputational damage, which has already occurred. Seconds after the leak, the internet was awash with people disappointed with how it looked. That it looked like shit. That if this was what it looks like, it would be a huge disappointment and, just quietly, what have the (lazy?) devs been up to all this time?

                              <span>A new Unreal Engine 5 trailer hypung up an as-of-yet unnamed project based on the Korean Fantasy Novel, The Bird That Drinks Tears, has been released. The visual concept trailer, titled The Nhaga Eater, is a fairly violent affair kicking off with a decapitation before we see the brutal aftermath of a larger, bloodier battle.
This concept trailer, released by KRAFTON Inc, was released to showcase the future aesthetics of a variety of future projects KRAFTON are working on in collaboration with Iain McCaig, an American artist, writer, and film maker previously involved with IP such as Star Wars, Terminator, The Avengers, and more.
This trailer is the kicking off point for a variety of projects. There will indeed be a game, with no planned release date as of right now as KRAFTON is currently recruiting a team for the project. Until then, there’s an artbook releasing in 2022 followed by a graphic novel based on the same original Korean Novel to come in 2023. In the official press release, an official motion picture is also mentioned, although details on this are scarce.

Wilson, who attended the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2022, spoke about EA&#x27;s current portfolio of games, some of what it plans to do with it going forward, and the company&#x27;s ambitions in mobile and beyond.

Our first look at the series was just a few seconds long, as the Blue Blur only popped up at the end of a promo clip. This time out, we get around 40 seconds of Sonic.
Announced in February as a collaboration between SEGA, WildBrain Studio (Carmen Sandiego, Ninjago), and Man of Action Entertainment (Marvel&#x27;s Avengers Assemble, Big Hero 6), the 3D animated series will consist of 24 episodes full of introspection and discovery for Sonic.

                              <span>Following the gigantic GTA 6 leak last weekend, several developers have come forward in solidarity with Rockstar against misinformed claims that graphics are among the first aspects of a game finished during game development. How have they done so? By posting images and footage of their own early builds, and the basic and often-hilariously patched together early assets.
The source of all this, the aforementioned GTA 6 leak, was confirmed to be real. With video of an early version of the highly anticipated open world title out in the wild, anyone and everyone has been able to see the leak if they wish to do so. Some of them, including one (now locked) account which posted “If you knew how game development goes, you’d know that visuals are one of the first things done. The game is 4 years into planning &amp; development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get.”
This, obviously, is wildly wrong. In response to this viral nonsense, several devs from a variety of sizable and independent developers have gone online and shown off unfinished visuals in early builds. Kurt Margenau — the co-lead for Uncharted 4 — retweeted a previously posted clip of the downhill car chase with blockmesh environments. This same video transitions between three distinct stages of completion and comes alongside a statement “there are a million stages in between”, further emphasising the amount of work happens before the visuals are finished.

                              <span>We&#x27;re just a couple of days away from the second and final weekend of the Modern Warfare 2 beta. This round expands to PC and Xbox, and offers PlayStation players another chance to go hands-on with the multiplayer shooter.
As you might expect, players wasted no time offering feedback about design changes they liked, didn&#x27;t like, and a few of the bugs and map exploits discovered thus far - even if many of those grievances return from Modern Warfare 2019 in a clear sign Infinity Ward doesn&#x27;t intend to change them.
What the developer does actually want to do are a few tweaks in time for weekend two. In a blog post, Infinity Ward addressed several major points of feedback and whether or not they&#x27;ll be changed this weekend.

                              <span>Consider the humble sphere. Now, imagine it crashing through some precariously placed wooden skittles at 40mph. That’s ten pin bowling in a nutshell, and it’s as high-octane a thrillride as it sounds.
PBA Pro Bowling 2023 may just be the greatest video game that has ever resulted from the coveted PBA Pro Bowling video game licence. And we’re not saying that lightly: we genuinely believe that it’s the best PBA Pro Bowling [YEAR] game since PBA Pro Bowling 2021 (that’s the last one, they skipped a year, dunno why didn’t ask).
In America, bowling is a serious televised sport with commentators and rules and that. Unfortunately, in Britain, it’s just a thing you might do if you’ve just come out of the cinema but feel like it’s too early to call it a night, and you also fancy some microwaved hot wings. They say our two nations are separated by a common language, but I’ve often felt that people who say that have failed to take into account the several thousand miles of ocean and divergent attitudes toward mid-tier leisure activities.

                              <span>MultiVersus is a game that has brought out heaps of character requests from the community ever since its launch — earlier even! Being a platform fighter where vastly diverse Warner Bros characters battle it out, the title invites wishlists and an outpouring of What Ifs when it comes to upcoming fighters. Thanks to a recent bit of polling, we have a rough idea of what the most-requested community characters are.
Twitter user MrWhite4MVS, an account dedicated to spreading the good word of the Walter-White-for-MultiVersus, posted a round-up of each character mention in the character wishlist channel within the official MultiVersus Discord. At number one is Ben 10, followed by Walter White, The Warners, Mordecai &amp; Rigby and Gumball.
Now obviously, it’s worth noting that character mentions aren’t exactly votes. One dedicated Mordecai &amp; Rigby fan could just spam out mentions until they started annoying the mods, or a gaggle of Gumball lovers could all constantly meme post to victory.

                              <span>With the launch of Frozen Planet 2, narrated by the one and only David Attenborough, BBC Earth has partnered with Minecraft to bring different audiences together. Following the release of each episode, which will air weekly, Minecraft Education has created five Frozen Planet 2-inspired worlds for Minecraft fans to try out.
Each Minecraft world is inspired by the Frozen Planet 2 episode before it, featuring immersive landscapes and game-based learning resources so that younger audiences can get more involved with the landmark series.
As one of the best-selling games of all time, with significant popularity across younger audiences, Minecraft also has a lesser-known Education Edition which is specifically aimed at providing educational content. This content is intended to help students learn about a variety of subjects via gameplay, and the team at Mojang Studios believes it is responsible for using Minecraft to create a better world.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that impossible geometry is better than games playing the music CD left in your drive. As someone definitely not attempting to rig the vote, I respect people on both sides yet am pleased by this outcome. This week, ah sure, why not have another crack at pitting two similar-ish things against each other. It feels against the spirit of the competition but I&#x27;m curious. Let&#x27;s try two sounds. What&#x27;s better: ding! or the Howie scream?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover &#x27;charms&#x27;. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it&#x27;s something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

Creator Derek Yu said that more updates are planned for Spelunky 2, but the next step is to get feedback on multiplayer to improve the experience now its basic features are there. Don’t expect any more additions to single-player though, as the focus there is bug fixes.

The company said they became aware of the attack early yesterday, after an “unauthorized third party” managed to access the credentials of a vendor to 2K’s help desk platform. The hacker then fired off a message to some accounts that contained a malicious link.

Think of the Machinist as the Aldi equivalent to Marvel’s Tony Stark, Iron Man. He’s still packed to the circuit boards with machine guns, lasers and drones, even if he is an own-brand alternative to the Armoured Avenger.

                              <span>The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon&#x27;s Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon&#x27;s trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here&#x27;s the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That&#x27;s how it feels to play, too.

                              <span>Of all the games I sampled at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, Scorn surprised me the most. For whatever reason, I was expecting this survival horror adventure to ditch spookiness for kookiness, perhaps rattling my bones with hyper-violence and monsoons of crimson.
Nope - the game wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

                              <span>Star Citizen, the controversial space sim from developer Cloud Imperium Games, has now raised more than half a billion dollars in funding from backers.


Star Citizen&#x27;s exceedingly lengthy development is well-documented, with the game still in alpha over a decade after production began. And while it&#x27;s attracted some private funding in that time, the overwhelming bulk has come via crowdfunding, beginning with a successful $2m USD Kickstarter in 2012 and ballooning from there.


As of today, Star Citizen has amassed $500,075,150 USD in crowdfunding from a total of 4,096,384 backers, according to the official Roberts Space Industries website. Its previous major milestone of $400m USD raised was reached last November, meaning it&#x27;s taken a further ten months to accrue an additional $100m.

                              <span>Apple has announced it will be raising its App Store prices in multiple territories - including every country that uses the euro, but excluding the UK at present - starting on 5th October.


As per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. 


When the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99. App Store developers who offer subscriptions will, however, have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.

                              <span>If FIFA 23&#x27;s 700+ plus real-life football clubs somehow aren&#x27;t enough to be getting on with, it looks like you&#x27;ll soon be able to sling a decidedly more imaginary one onto the pile, with all signs pointing to an appearance from Ted Lasso&#x27;s AFC Richmond in this year&#x27;s game.


Hints of an impending crossover with the award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series first emerged last week, when a listing for AFC Richmond - the fictional London team managed by Ted Lasso in the show - briefly appeared on EA&#x27;s FIFA ratings database  before being removed.


That might have been the end of it, but now the official Ted Lasso Twitter account has shared an image showing what appears to be Ted Lasso actor Jason Sudeikis, albeit from behind, ensconced in the FIFA team&#x27;s facial capture rig - used to digitise the real-world likeness of players (and, for the first time this year, managers) for use in-game.

                              <span>Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We&#x27;ve been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we&#x27;re hard at work on content focusing on the firm&#x27;s latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.
First impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It&#x27;s easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we&#x27;ve seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you&#x27;re one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.
We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we&#x27;re not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we&#x27;ve put together a teaser video showing some of the work we&#x27;ve already done.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s new season is now underway, after kicking off on Sunday with a fresh cinematic that finally unmasks Brie Larson as a key character. 


For several months now, Larson has been voicing the role of Paradigm, one of the game&#x27;s heroic Seven. The Captain Marvel actress debuted as Paradigm in Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 3 Season 2 live event, where she commanded players as they took control of the game&#x27;s infamous bear mech. 


Larson has regularly popped up since, voicing audio logs and mission chatter for Fortnite&#x27;s weekly tasks through the recently-concluded Chapter 3 Season 3. Now, with the launch of Season 4, we&#x27;ve seen her with her helmet off for the first time.

Nintendo Minute was a weekly series which ended in December 2021. The show was hosted by former PR managers for Nintendo of America Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang. Since Nintendo Minute ended, the pair both left Nintendo and went on to create their own podcast.

In episode 31 of Kit and Krysta Podcast, when responding to questions submitted through Patreon, Ellis and Yang recalled a time when they had brought up the idea of a Nuzlocke run to The Pokémon Company.

This trailer sees everyone&#x27;s favourite blue blur being incredibly blue and blurry as he makes his way through the world. Oh, and Shadow and Doctor Eggman are also hot on his heels. 


Along with this teaser, which you can see below, Sega has assured us that Sonic will &quot;shatter&quot; our worlds when Sonic Prime airs this winter on Netflix. And yes, I feel quite agitated writing about a Netflix show with the word &#x27;Prime&#x27; in its title.

                              <span>Nvidia has announced its latest generation of GeForce RTX graphics cards at its GTC AI conference. The Nvidia RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are the first GPUs from the &#x27;Ada Lovelace&#x27; series, and they should be up to twice as fast as their last-gen counterparts in rasterised games - and up to four times as fast in ray-traced games.  
The RTX 4090 24GB will be available on October 12th and costs $1599, while the RTX 4080 16GB arrives in November and costs $1199. There&#x27;s also an RTX 4080 12GB model that costs $899. The 4090 and 4080 are reportedly two to four times faster than their Ampere equivalents, which are the 3090 Ti and the 3080 Ti, respectively. 
Note that Nvidia RTX 30-series cards will remain on sale for the moment, filling in the bottom part of the market until lower-tier RTX 40-series GPUs arrive.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it is developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game.


The project is in the works at Star Wars Squadrons studio Motive, which is also developing the upcoming Dead Space remake.


The game - which is yet to be titled - still seems some way off, and EA lists it as in pre-production. As with other recent early announcements, the confirmation appears to have been made to spur recuitment on the game (and also follows earlier whispers of its existence).

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man made its way to PC earlier in the year, and along with it a multitude of mods have swung onto the scene. 


Now, one such mod has given the game a literal face lift, by replacing the new model of Peter Parker with that of the game&#x27;s original PlayStation 4 one. 


This mod was uploaded to Nexus mods by DaigronCDM. Known as the &#x27;John Bubniak - PS4 face restoration mod&#x27;, it does exactly as you&#x27;d expect. It makes Peter Parker look more like John Bubniak, Spidey&#x27;s original face model before the character was redesigned to look more like actor Yuri Lowenthal.

                              <span>Microsoft has ditched its online checks for Xbox One discs when playing on an Xbox Series X.
The online requirements for Xbox games have previously come under fire for being unclear and rendering downloaded and offline games unplayable during service outages. 

Microsoft has recently made a quiet change to the checks made when launching games on Xbox Series X. For anyone making good use of the Series X&#x27;s backwards compatibility, there are now no online DRM checks for Xbox One discs. (Of course, this was not an issue on the disc-less Series S.)

This mechanic, spotted by VGC, now offers players the opportunity to switch game regions from 50Hz PAL (a notably slower standard) to NTSC 60Hz through Syphon Filter 2&#x27;s settings menu.


You can see how this process looks in the image below.

Of course, this batch is undoubtedly headlined by the long-awaited arrival of Deathloop, the full version of Grounded, and indie hit Valheim on PC.


Parents and the young at heart may also be pleased to see new release Paw Patrol Grand Prix is also part of this latest update. The popular pups&#x27; take on Mario Kart joins Game Pass next week.

                              <span>After last week&#x27;s info blowout, the open beta for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 went live over the weekend, allowing us to get intimate with all the new mechanics and systems for the follow-up to Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2019 reboot (and not to be confused with 2009&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2, of course). Things were kept intimate when it comes to game modes, too, with a focus on 6v6 stalwarts - as well as a cameo from the returning third-person playlist - which helped underline how different it feels. Does it work? Well opinion is split, so here&#x27;s two takes from two very different kinds of Call of Duty players. 
Martin: So let&#x27;s get this out the way first - I&#x27;m a filthy casual when it comes to CoD. I pick up every game on launch, blast through the campaign (or as has been the case in recent years, get bored of it after an hour or two and never pick it up again) then spend a couple of dozen hours or so in the multiplayer, dipping in and out over the year. So I&#x27;m not exactly the one to be drilling down into the details. I will say this, though - having blown cold on the series since Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2019 brilliant reboot, this has properly sucked me back in, and I was shocked how different it feels to the first Modern Warfare. Or the second one - the one that came out in 2019, that is. Anyway, it&#x27;s an amazingly slow take on the Call of Duty formula, and the tense pacing has really caught me by surprise. 
Wes: It definitely plays slower, and I think that’s by Infinity Ward’s design. Everything from the slide cancelling nerf to the blisteringly fast time to kill forces you to play more cautious. The mini map isn’t much help at all, and having to wait four or eight minutes into a match to unlock certain perks that make you quieter adds a tactical element to what has been a traditionally fast-paced, run-and-gun 6v6 Call of Duty multiplayer. The footsteps are so loud!

The same attacker also said they were behind last week&#x27;s high-profile hack of ride app Uber, which has provided an update on its own investigations.


&quot;There are also reports over the weekend that this same actor breached video game maker Rockstar Games,&quot; Uber wrote in a newly-updated blog. &quot;We are in close coordination with the FBI and US Department of Justice on this matter and will continue to support their efforts.&quot;

As a result, it has now sent out all its emails to those in the Q3 bracket of reservations, and is now getting a headstart on those in Q4.

                              <span>Developer Brianna Lei has announced a sequel to her 2017 game Butterfly Soup, and it&#x27;s out next month.

Butterfly Soup 2 is due to launch on 29th October, and will follow the four main characters a few months after the original story.

We&#x27;ve previously featured Butterfly Soup in a piece by Natalie Flores on the humanisation of queer women through humour in games, and Butterfly Soup has this in spades.

Talking to IGN, Director Kento Kinoshita stated Capcom is &quot;creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga.&quot;


This means any future entries to the series will likely introduce us to a new set of characters or bring back some older faces from the previous generations of games - though Capcom itself is tight-lipped on any further details.

Wilson issued the comment at a financial event organised by Goldman Sachs (transcribed by Seeking Alpha), where he contrasted Call of Duty&#x27;s situation with that of Battlefield - the latter of which, he boasted, was &quot;platform agnostic&quot;.


&quot;In a world where there may be questions over the future of Call of Duty and what platforms that might be on or might not be on, being platform agnostic and completely cross-platform with Battlefield, I think is a tremendous opportunity,&quot; Wilson said.

As with previous leaks from August, this footage appears to have originated from the ongoing Friend and Family beta version of the game - something that is labelled as a &quot;private test build&quot;. 


The latest leaks were uploaded to reddit and show a total of 43 minutes of gameplay footage. This  work-in-progress  footage includes the map, various cosmetic options and a variety of attacks - though is all subject to change before the release of the full game.

The report, by Insider Gaming, suggests the console will otherwise have near-identical hardware to current PS5 models, with the only difference being the removable drive itself, and an extra USB-C port for it to plug in.


There&#x27;s also the suggestion this new console will be sold both on its own and with the detachable disc drive included.

Allen recently gathered some online clout around the fact he had posted, under the alias The Real Insider, details of the various Assassin&#x27;s Creed games Ubisoft was set to announce during its event last week. 


How did Allen know these details? He had been pre-briefed by Ubisoft itself on the contents of its presentation under embargo - which he then promptly ignored and wrote anonymously about on the internet.

                              <span>I first read Paul Auster when I was at university. A tutor recommended The Music of Chance, I think, and I ended up reading all of his stuff in one of those bursts of love you sometimes get for writers. Then, I sort of dropped out of the Auster business. At the beginning of lockdown, I re-read Leviathan, on a whim, and didn&#x27;t love it. I re-read The New York Trilogy, which I had adored the first time around, and thought it was fine.


Auster&#x27;s a weird writer, and he&#x27;s weird in a way that no other writer I&#x27;ve encountered is weird. He&#x27;s playful yet also humourless. Is that combination even possible? Auster suggests it is: his stuff is filled with games and allusions and illusions, riffs on Don Quixote or Tesla  - but you can&#x27;t really imagine any of his protagonists ever laughing, and his text unfolds elegantly while being scrubbed clean of much in the way of character.


He reminds me, in a way, of Magritte, and not just because of the way Auster flirts with surrealism. Magritte paints magical things, but in the most pedestrian manner. That&#x27;s not a knock on him - it&#x27;s part of the effect. Astonishing things happen to Auster characters, but they describe their adventures as if they&#x27;re describing a trip to the grocery store.

                              <span>As expected, Nvidia have announced the GeForce RTX 4090 during their GeForce Beyond livestream – and confirmed the RTX 4080 for good measure. Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects.

                              <span>The rumoured Iron Man game is real, it turns out. Today, Marvel Games and Motive Studios have revealed they’re working together on a new game starring the armoured Avenger. Marvel announced the project with a single shadowy image of Iron Man and his shiny gamer highlights on Twitter. They described the game as an “all-new single-player, third-person, action-adventure title”. The dev team is being led by Olivier Proulx, who previously worked on Eidos-Montréal’s Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy. Motive are known for 2020’s Star Wars: Squadrons and the upcoming Dead Space remake.

That’s less than two weeks before we’ll see how AMD will combat the GeForce RTX 4090 and its brethren, most likely taking the form of the Radeon RX 7000 series of GPUs.

Except the game didn’t seem to be following the naming convention of its predecessor Yakuza: Like A Dragon, instead ditching the part associated with the Japanese crime syndicate. The head of series developers Ryu Ga Gotoku, Masayoshi Yokoyama, has since confirmed the change in a recent interview (thanks IGN).

That’s thanks to yet another uptick in production speed, according to a Steam Community post, so everyone whose delivery estimate was in Q3 2022 should now have received their confirmation email. Fulfilment of the final remaining Q4 batch is now fully underway, after a smaller handful of lucky Q4-ers were bumped forward into Q3.

The update also rebalances relics, improves UI and AI, and brings back Culture Workers.

Well, that’s exactly what’s happened for some of us today. Hyper Demon seems to be all about the disembodied, infernal craniums too, but don’t call it a sequel.

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

According to the NPD, total videogame industry spending declined 5% year-over-year (yoy) to $4.10 billion. Year-to-date spending sits at $34.6 billion, a 9% decline yoy.
For the month of August, hardware sales grew by 14% yoy to $375 million, helped by improved supply of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. Year-to-date hardware spending declined by 4% to $2.9 billion.

                              <span>I’ll admit that I haven’t read a single thing about what the new RTX 40 Series GPUs give us. I know they are going to cost over a grand and that there are two models of card coming, but that’s about it. I saw some tweets about AI and someone mentioned Morrowind, at which point our video producer Jim Trinca fell off his Star Trek chair. 

I don’t care about that stuff, although I hope Jim didn’t break his Babylon 5 models he bought a 3D printer to make. I care about Portal with RTX. My mind almost bled out my ears when I saw this reveal happen in front of my near-melted eyeballs. Not only does it look incredible, but I had a vision that this would happen only this morning. 

Having sat pondering life and how I’m actually happy The Last of Us got a remake even though it’s not that old, I considered other games getting the same treatment. With my son playing Portal 2 as it’s on Games With Gold for Xbox, I thought, “Portal remake would be nice, wouldn’t it.” And oh yes it would. Just look at this trailer. Lovely.

                              <span>It’s an understatement to say that this past weekend has been a pretty big one for video game leaks. That sentiment is primarily driven by the huge story of a hacker breaking into Rockstar games’ systems and illegally revealing vast swathes of the next Grand Theft Auto game – but as that happened another story quietly unfoldedd, one of the undoing of a recent rising star of the leaker community. It’s also a story that, I’d argue, exposes how silly this whole leaking affair is. 

If you don’t follow Games Twitter with a laser focus (and who can blame you), here’s what happened. A new Twitter account popped up called ‘TheRealInsider’, and it began revealing things about upcoming gaming announcements and marketing beats. People quickly started paying attention because it got stuff right. Its initial big break was revealing information about Ubisoft’s huge slate of upcoming Assassin’s Creed games – and then more and more information about other games followed. It grew a huge following in a very short time. 
As part of that Assassin’s Creed reveal, TheRealInsider made a rookie error. When one high-profile member of the media not clued in about the upcoming Assassin’s projects said he wasn’t sure their claims were true, they got smug. There was some mocking, some boasting. When the announcement came, some ‘I told you so’.

The team is being led by Olivier Proulx, who worked on past Marvel titles such as Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and is joined by industry veterans Ian Frazier, Maelenn Lumineau, and JF Poirier at the studio.
Developed in collaboration with Marvel Games, the game will feature an original narrative that &quot;taps into the history&quot; of Iron Man, and will allow you to feel what it’s like to truly play Tony Stark&#x27;s alter ego.

                              <span>There may be a new PS5 on the horizon, if the sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are to be believed. This shiny new PS5 will have a detachable disc drive, allowing you to plug in and play any physical games you&#x27;ve got lying around. This PS5 will also apparently abandon the A, B and C chassis that previous iterations have used. It will however have the same hardware capabilities as current models.
According to the anonymous sources who spoke to Insider Gaming, the detachable disc drive will connect to the PS5 via a USB port at the back of the console. This new console will reportedly be sold on its own or as part of a bundle, with the detachable drive also being sold seperately so you can (relatively) cheaply replace it if you swing it around, step on it, or bust it up via other methods.
It&#x27;s no secret that the PS5 has been a product that many have been desperately trying to grab since its release back in 2020! This new version of the console appears to bridge the gap between the regular and digital PS5s, so if you weren&#x27;t too sure which version was ideal for you, the best of both worlds is now available.

It will be held on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 consoles. Cross-play and cross-progress for all platforms will also be supported.
Blizzard said it decided to focus on the end game for a few reasons, but chief among those is it doesn’t want to spoil the full story of Diablo 4. For many, the end game is their favorite aspect of Diablo, anyway, so the team wants to test it out to ensure it &quot;feels satisfying&quot; and that there will be ample time to act on feedback.

                              <span>Deathloop is now, finally, a multiplatform title. After a year of timed exclusivity to the PS5 (a deal infamously struck prior to Microsoft’s acquisition of its studio) it’s now out on Xbox Series S/X, but perhaps more importantly, it’s now available on subscription services – both Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Extra – so it has never been easier or cheaper to experience this underappreciated gem of a game.
The guts of it are basically identical: it plays exactly the same on all platforms, although with Xbox you do of course lose the impressive haptics of the DualSense controller. But, there is a trade-off on Series X, as far as I can tell at least: the framerate in Visual Quality mode (the one that looks nicer than performance but isn’t raytracing) is noticeably smoother on Series X, although I’d like to caveat that this is purely based on some quick A/B testing and doesn’t take into account that the two machines handle variable refresh rate differently (according to Digital Foundry, the PS5 implementation isn’t as good, for what it’s worth).
But look, look, none of that matters: it’s DEATHLOOP, and it’s no longer gated behind a £60 entry fee. Which is a great thing, as Dom argues here, as Deathloop struggled to find an audience back at launch, due in no small part to its premium price point and the scarce availability of next-gen consoles at the time. Particularly PS5s, which are still tricky to get a hold of to this day.

                              <span>If you tend to follow what we can charitably dub &#x27;the Call of Duty discourse&#x27; every year, you&#x27;ve likely been exposed to what appear to be the same complaints, same arguments, and same suggestions made ad nauseam. This is obviously true for the yearly Call of Duty releases, but the new Modern Warfare series has been a particularly sore spot for the most devoted fans.
The Modern Warfare 2 beta just ended its first weekend – available on a single platform – but already, we&#x27;re seeing a high level of engagement from players who jumped in since servers went live.
What struck me as a little strange wasn&#x27;t the volume of posts on Reddit, and social media, it was that the complaints being made about Modern Warfare 2 are the same exact ones we heard during the Modern Warfare 2019 beta and launch – often by the same people.

                              <span>World of Warcraft Classic players will do almost anything to head into the upcoming Wrath of the Lich King expansion launch with an advantage. If we’re being honest, building up to the release is the only thing to do right now. However, it can be a source of pain and frustration for some — be it through farming Alterac Valley or struggling to get past (the now far smaller) login queues.
However, its professions that stand out as the foundation to the latest major pain point for forward-thinking players. Right now, in game, players are fighting tooth and nail over ore all around the world of Azeroth and Outland. Far from the battlegrounds and arenas are brawls over mining nodes.
“Nodes aren’t plentiful in vanilla classic as they weren&#x27;t on game release,” says Squee, a level 53 Priest levelling on the Thekal fresh server in the weeks leading up to Wrath of the Lich King. “There are only a few zones where you can get ore and level up, and at the moment, no matter which zone you go to, you’ll run into 3-4 other players running the same route”. They are one of many players currently farming mining in order to funnel resources towards jewelcrafting and / or engineering.

                              <span>If you’re a regular VG247 visitor, you’ll know how much we loved Deathloop when it launched in 2021. In his review, Alex called it Arkane&#x27;s best game yet – a confident successor to Dishonored, and a bold demonstration of what developer Arkane can do when it’s unshackled from legacy IP (whether or not it has a choice in the matter). 

But I, like many others I know, did not play this exemplary realisation of the immersive sim genre when it launched. The game dropped to $40 on the PS5 just weeks after launch. The conversation around it dried up quickly. And that’s not fair on the game, not really, because it’s a little slice of video gaming perfection, dressed up with stylish 70s-esque cool, loaded with more quips than a Bond flick, and brimming with enough genius gameplay ideas to make even the folks at Irrational Games blush.

It’s not the first time the prohibitively expensive nature of new-gen, platform-specific games has caused issues for developers trying to find an audience (here’s looking at you, Returnal). These experimental, impressive, and – in my eyes – essential games are simply overlooked by many, purely because that initial point of entry asks for so much cash.

                              <span>To protect web resources with Kerberos you may use Apache HTTPD with mod_auth_gssapi — however, all web scripts (e.g., PHP) run under Apache will have access to the Kerberos long-term symmetric secret credential (keytab). If someone can get it, they can impersonate your server, which is bad.
The gssproxy project makes it possible to introduce privilege separation to reduce the attack surface. There is a tutorial for RPM-based distributions (Fedora, RHEL, AlmaLinux, etc), but I wanted to get this to work on a DPKG-based distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel, PureOS, etc) and found it worthwhile to document the process. I’m using Ubuntu 22.04 below, but have tested it on Debian 11 as well.  I have adopted the gssproxy package in Debian, and testing this setup is part of the scripted autopkg…</span>

                              <span>Being able to SSH into remote machines and do work there is great. Using hardware security tokens for 2FA is also great. But trying to use them both at the same time doesn&#x27;t work super well, because if you hit a WebAuthn request on the remote machine it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you mash your token - it&#x27;s not going to work.
But could it?
The SSH agent protocol abstracts key management out of SSH itself and into a separate process. When you run &quot;ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa&quot;, that key is being loaded into the SSH agent. When SSH wants to use that key to authenticate to a remote system, it asks the SSH agent to perform the cryptographic signatures on its behalf. SSH also supports forwarding the SSH agent protocol over SSH itself, so if you SSH into a remote system then remote clients can also access yo…</span>

                              <span>Back in 2018, I made a two part series about terminal emulators
that was actually pretty painful to write. So I&#x27;m not going to retry
this here, not at all. Especially since I&#x27;m not submitting this to the
excellent LWN editors so I can get away with not being very good
at writing. Phew.
Still, it seems my future self will thank me for collecting my
thoughts on the terminal emulators I have found out about since I
wrote that article. Back then, Wayland was not quite at the level
where it is now, being the default in Fedora (2016), Debian (2019),
RedHat (2019), and Ubuntu (2021). Also, a bunch of folks thought they
would solve everything by using OpenGL for rendering. Let&#x27;s see how
things stack up.

                              <span>After my last post, someone suggested that having employers be able to restrict keys to machines they control is a bad thing. So here&#x27;s why I think Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios are bad not only for employers, but also for users.
There&#x27;s obvious mutual appeal to having developers use their own hardware rather than rely on employer-provided hardware. The user gets to use hardware they&#x27;re familiar with, and which matches their ergonomic desires. The employer gets to save on the money required to buy new hardware for the employee. From this perspective, there&#x27;s a clear win-win outcome.
But once you start thinking about security, it gets more complicated. If I, as an employer, want to ensure that any systems that can access my resources meet a certain security baseline (eg, I don&#x27;t wa…</span>

                              <span>I today released version 0.06.4
of my WAP WML browser wApua and also uploaded that release to Debian Unstable.




It’s a bugfix release and the first upstream release since 2017.


WAP WML pages with more recent DTD
location URLs ending in .dtd instead of .xml
(and some other small difference). No idea when these URLs changed,
but I assume they have been changed to look more like the URLs of
other DTDs. The old URLs of the DTD still work, but more recent WAP
pages (yes, they do exist :-) seem to use the new DTD URLs, so there
was a need to recognise them instead of throwing an annoying warning.

In this latest season, a mysterious substance has appeared on the island, which is very chrome in look and presumably feel. Using a chrome splash has an interesting effect, where throwing it at a wall will let you literally just walk through it, which sounds like a fun way to mix things up.


Chroming yourself, a sentence I never thought I&#x27;d write, will let you speed around as a blob while sprinting, and during the limited buff you&#x27;ll be immune to fire damage. Being blobbed, as Epic Games puts it, will also make you immune to fall damage, and gives you a little air dash. Dashing into any building piece also chrome-ifys it, which as established, lets you phase through it.

While he&#x27;s not the most memorable character in the world, Farmer did appear in a number of the various arcs in Dragon Ball Z, and now Bandai Namco has announced that you&#x27;ll be able to play as him in the upcoming Dead by Daylight-like Dragon Ball: The Breakers. Most notably, he has a shotgun, but it probably isn&#x27;t all that useful.


Villains wise, considering he&#x27;s on the boxart, we generally already knew that Majin Buu was going to be in the game, but the pink blob has been officially confirmed to be coming to the game, with all three of his forms to evolve through. Disgustingly, it looks like that if you do get swallowed up by the Super Buu you can run around his guts, and will possibly have a chance to escape.

                              <span>Capcom has said that the upcoming Resident Evil Village DLC will be the last bit of story focused on the Winters family.


Not sure if there&#x27;s anyone that is particularly passionate about Ethan Winters and his family compared to other classic characters in the Resi series like cutie Leon, but for those out there that might want to know, the upcoming Shadows of Rose DLC will be the last to be all about the Winters family.


In an interview with IGN Japan at Tokyo Game Show, director Kento Kinoshita said Capcom is &quot;creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga.&quot; So essentially, expect some fresh faces in future entries, or at least to see older characters return as protagonists.

As shared by Reddit user iV1rus0 on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, about 53 minutes of the upcoming sequel is available to watch as a pair of videos, one that&#x27;s around five minutes in length, the other around 38 minutes. While the GTA 6 footage was the result of a hack, this Diablo footage appears to be from a Discord stream, as the app&#x27;s notification sounds can be heard in the background.


You can even hear the people streaming the game, though their voices have been distorted, likely as to protect their identity. Though all of the footage has been watermarked, so who knows how effective that will be.

While the developer, and its parent company Take-Two, moved quickly to take down as many of them on social media and video platforms as possible, the damage had already been done. Given the nature of the leaks themselves (clearly originating from development builds), it was assumed that the developer&#x27;s network had been hacked.
This was, in fact, an accurate guess. In a statement posted to Twitter, the studio acknowledged the leak, confirming that it was the result of an unauthorised network breach.

                              <span>The weekend has brought Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two, a lot of headaches. A massive amount of GTA 6 development videos and screenshots were published online by an anonymous leaker. GTA never suffered a leak at this scale, and the material understandably got published everywhere.
The footage and screenshots showed various bits of gameplay, a Red Dead Redemption 2-like conversation system, some vehicle action, and a bit of the open world. More importantly, it featured the rumoured protagonist, and seemingly confirmed the Vice City setting, which has long been rumoured, and recently confirmed by a Bloomberg report.
The leaks were posted by a user named teapotuberhacker on the GTA Forums. Since then, the thread was locked and the media removed, though it&#x27;s available to read once again at the time of this writing.

                              <span>My favourite Monkey Island story isn&#x27;t about a puzzle or a character or a joke. It&#x27;s not Stan and his hand-talking, or the severed head that can lead you through mazes. It&#x27;s not actually a story from the game itself. It&#x27;s to do with a friend of my wife&#x27;s. This friend once admitted that, as a kid, whenever she had a story she wanted to tell her mum, her mum would always stop her at the start and say, with what I&#x27;m guessing was a heavy, deeply theatrical sigh, &quot;Is this about Monkey Island?&quot;


I think about this a lot. A kid who was so in love with Monkey Island, who spoke about it with such granularity and such endless passion, that it made their mum grow wary of every fresh conversation. To this day whenever I&#x27;m particularly boring my wife will stop me and say, &quot;Is this about Monkey Island?&quot; Conversation ended. Conversation defeated.


And of course the funny thing is, if there was ever a game worth talking about it&#x27;s Monkey Island. Let me clarify: loads of games are worth talking about, but Monkey Island - the first one - is singular in how much it&#x27;s worth telling people about. Things happened in that game that felt unprecedented back in the early 1990s. The scope of it, the richness of the Caribbean setting, the ease of the comedic tone. But also the set-pieces. The fact that the fourth wall was acknowledged and then shattered. As school kids playing this game in the evenings and weekends, game characters who were almost aware they were game characters - who were made to say things that they realised they hadn&#x27;t chosen to say? Well, this felt almost illicit. Maths room, 9am on a Monday: You will not believe what happened in Monkey Island last night.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a shorter DF Direct blog this week - it&#x27;s supposed to be a public holiday - but our weekly show goes live on YouTube as normal and it&#x27;s a special one on two accounts. First of all, there&#x27;s well over two hours of discussion to wade through, covering the latest Sony State of Play, last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and the biggest news from the Tokyo Game Show. The second factor that makes this one rather special? That&#x27;ll be a 40 minute (!) guest slot for none other than Eurogamer&#x27;s Ian Higton!
You may have watched and read Ian&#x27;s excellent PlayStation VR 2 content last week - but we had questions about the new headset. Lots of them. As we didn&#x27;t get to see the hardware in person, we pinned down Ian (not literally) and bombarded him with our queries. Rather obligingly, Ian was very forthcoming and his segment is the centrepiece of this week&#x27;s show. Beyond that, it&#x27;s about State of Play as we mull over the likes of God of War Ragnarok, Tekken 8 and Rise of the Ronin, while Alex has much to say about Capcom&#x27;s ExoPrimal, which wasn&#x27;t in the State of Play but ended up as a discussion point anyway.
We also talk about the latest Nintendo Direct with titles including Octopath Traveller 2, Pikmin 4, Bayonetta 3, Radiant Silvergun and GoldenEye to look forward to, while there&#x27;s also the matter of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Alex gets sweet, sweet revenge on his critics (on the matter of, um, volumetric clouds) and we ponder whether the game is still &#x27;too big for Switch&#x27;

                              <span>Rockstar has acknowledged the enormous Grand Theft Auto 6 leak of work-in-progress development materials that took place over the weekend.
In a statement published this afternoon on Twitter, as the company returned to work, Rockstar admitted it had suffered a &quot;network intrusion&quot; - a hack - from which the early development footage of GTA 6 had been taken.
Rockstar said it hoped the hack would have no impact on its live services - such as GTA Online - and insisted the leak would not impact the development of the game long-term. Still, Rockstar acknowleged it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; at what had happened.

                              <span>To plant my piratey flag up front, I am an extremely huge fan of the Monkey Island series, and am therefore almost exactly who Return To Monkey Island is aimed at. After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won&#x27;t be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

This specification packs in a Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, Radeon RX 6700S GPU, 1TB NVMe SSD, 16GB of DDR5 and a 14-in 1440p 120Hz screen - and it&#x27;s been discounted from $1650 to $1350, saving you $300. That&#x27;s an awesome price for this level of performance, all in a compact 14-in chassis that&#x27;s easy to tote around or work with on the go.

                              <span>The RTX 4090 is all but confirmed now, based on the sheer volume of leaks, rumours and speculation showing off the next-gen Nvidia GPU in a variety of guises but sharing the same specs. That&#x27;s pushed the prices of current-gen GPUs way down, and that&#x27;s especially true for high-end cards. Ergo, it&#x27;s not a massive surprise to see the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, Team Green&#x27;s flagship card, down to just $999 at Amazon after debuting at twice that figure.

One massive 1600W 80+ Platinum unit has been highly discounted over in the States, where the EVGA SuperNova 1600 P+ is down to $200 from its original price of $500. That&#x27;s an awesome deal on a power supply ideally suited for high-end, multiple-GPU systems - and doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a Platinum-rated 1000W PSU.

                              <span>A huge number of videos purporting to show in-game development footage for GTA 6 have been plastered across various internet forums this morning, because apparently no one can wait until a video game is actually anywhere near finished before they feel compelled to spoil it for all and sundry. 
The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won&#x27;t find a link to them here, because the truth is, they&#x27;re simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn&#x27;t going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it&#x27;s actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

                              <span>343 Industries has confirmed its withdrawing the dedicated playlist for Halo Infinite mode Land Grab.

In a brief statement about it on Halo Waypoint, 343i said that whilst it knew &quot;many players have enjoyed this new mode&quot;, it had been &quot;steadily declining&quot; and &quot;starting to fall short of the quality bar&quot;. Consequently, the dedicated playlist will be &quot;rotated out&quot; and will instead &quot;roll into Quick Play&quot; at the beginning of November.

&quot;On Tuesday, Sept. 20, the dedicated Land Grab playlist will be rotated out of matchmaking,&quot; the blog post reveals. &quot;While we know many players have enjoyed this new mode introduced in Season 2, at this stage it’s been steadily declining and starting to fall short of the quality bar for a positive player experience.

This means that new games coming to what would&#x27;ve been the &quot;Yakuza&quot; series will carry the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; name instead.

Confirmation comes by way of Sega, which confirmed to Kotaku that as the Like a Dragon branding is &quot;more closely align with the Japanese name&quot;, it is formally dropping the Yakuza name from every new title going forward.

&quot;Wizard101 servers have been temporarily shut down due to an unexpected issue,&quot; the company tweeted yesterday. &quot;We will keep everyone updated on when they will be back up. Thank you for your patience.&quot;

Though not set in stone, of course, producer/director Naoki Yoshida spoke at Tokyo Games Show and teased that Square Enix will &quot;probably release the trailer next month&quot;.

“I haven’t gotten a chance to talk to the marketing or public relations teams at all, so I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say, but I think we’ll probably be able to release the next trailer next month or so,&quot; Yoshida said (thanks, Gematsu).

                              <span>AI-generated imagery is here. Type a simple description of what you want to see into a computer and beautiful illustrations, sketches, or photographs pop up a few seconds later. By harnessing the power of machine learning, high-end graphics hardware is now capable of creating impressive, professional-grade artwork with minimal human input. But how could this affect video games? Modern titles are extremely art-intensive, requiring countless pieces of texture and concept art. If developers could harness this tech, perhaps the speed and quality of asset generation could radically increase. 


However, as with any groundbreaking technology, there&#x27;s plenty of controversy too: what role does the artist play if machine learning can generate high quality imagery so quickly and so easily? And what of the data used to train these AIs - is there an argument that machine learning-generated images are created by effectively passing off the work of human artists? There are major ethical questions to grapple with once these technologies reach a certain degree of effectiveness - and based on the rapid pace of improvement I&#x27;ve seen, the questions may need to be addressed sooner rather than later.


In the meantime, the focus of this piece is to see just how effective these technologies are right now. I tried three of the leading AI generators: DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney. You can see the results of these technologies in the embedded video below (and indeed in the collage at the top of this page) but to be clear, I generated all of them, either by using their web portals or else running them directly on local hardware.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing VR for a very long time now so my legs are pretty sturdy, but when legendary flatscreen to VR modder Raicuparta approached me with a preview build of his Neon White VR mod, I must admit I was a little apprehensive.
Surely a lightning-fast game like that would push me over the edge? I thought. But, oh my, how wrong I was. Not only was playing Neon White in VR a completely comfortable experience (for me - newcomers to VR beware!) but it also felt like the perfect &#x27;just one more go&#x27; VR game.
Playing Neon White in virtual reality was my first ever experience with the game, flat or not, and it honestly felt like a perfect fit for the medium. You can watch me demonstrate how this mod affects the gameplay of Neon White in this week&#x27;s episode of VR Corner, which features me swearing my way through a good chunk of the levels from Mission 3.

                              <span>An Elden Ring board game is on the way.

Steamforged Games - the team behind the Horizon Zero Dawn, Resident Evil, and Dark Souls tabletop games - will be launching a Kickstarter campaign &quot;soon&quot; to bring the officially-sanctioned board game adaptation to fruition. 

&quot;Like the video game, the Elden Ring board game will immerse players in the forsaken Lands Between,&quot; explains a press release from the company. &quot;In a vast, sprawling world of decaying grandeur that unfolds through their exploration, 1-4 ‘Tarnished’ players will embark on a huge and varied adventure, visiting iconic locations and crossing paths with familiar enemies and characters.&quot;

                              <span>90+ screenshots and videos reportedly taken from GTA 6 have leaked online.

Whilst there&#x27;s no way of authenticating them, the initially hostile response on the GTA Forums eventually softened as posters began to believe that the leaked assets were genuine.

Whilst, naturally, the unfinished game has missing assets and features, the videos give a rudimentary peek at the protagonists, the open world, and even the shooter&#x27;s combat, totalling over seven minutes&#x27; worth of unsanctioned footage.

Over in Japan right about now the Makuhari Messe is thrumming, its halls filled with the hushed excitement of a Tokyo Game Show that&#x27;s approaching full swing after three years on the lowdown. It&#x27;s an odd feeling seeing it all unfurl from afar - one of the great privileges of my job in pre-pandemic years was attending the show for Eurogamer, and being on the ground in Japan as it celebrates its gaming industry really was every bit as wonderful as you&#x27;d imagine. 


I&#x27;ve enough anecdotes over the years to fill a fairly sordid book, though to preserve the dignity of those involved - and myself - very few of them will ever see the light of day (and I&#x27;m pretty sure Wes and Tom still haven&#x27;t forgiven me for the stress I put them through as they tried to drag me from a Shinjuku bar in the early hours of the morning to get our flight home).

                              <span>With a new Monkey Island game coming next week, we decided to get a couple of Guybrush superfans together to talk about this magical, evocative, and hilarious series.

Chris Donlan: Years ago when I was at school, a friend of mine had Monkey Island on the family PC. I remember the PC was kept in the hallway, and we used to play for hours and hours into the evening. My memories of Melee Island at night are sort of mingled with the night of my friend’s house as we used to play this thing. I wonder: what are your early memories of Monkey Island? When did you realise it was the thing for you?

Victoria Kennedy: It was also a friend for me, or at least one of my brother’s friends. My first memories of Monkey Island are not actually playing it, but seeing other people playing it. I can clearly recall being so entranced by the music (something that to this day still gives me a delighted rush of Dopamine whenever I hear it), and also the colours. To put it simply, it really made me happy.

                              <span>A recent batch of Apex Legends weapon skins have been causing some controversy as a number of players believe that the aim down sights (ADS) are better than on other skins.


As reported by PCGamesN, some pay-to-win accusations have been thrown at developer Respawn due to the introduction of weapon skins like the Heat Sink skin. According to some players, the Heat Sink skin has a vastly superior ADS compared to other guns&#x27; skins. However, Respawn has since addressed the criticism, providing an update on said skin and more.


&quot;Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends,&quot; wrote Respawn in a blog post. &quot;As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in the sights functionality as well. During Season 4, we released the Heat Sink reactive skin for the VK-47 Flatline rifle and we heard feedback from some players that the Aim Down Sights (ADS) felt superior to any other skin available.

                              <span>Average playtime aggregator HowLongToBeat has been added into the Xbox app on PC.


As reported by Eurogamer, if you log on to the Xbox app on PC you&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s now a section titled HowLongToBeat which shows you how long the main story, main story and extras, completing the game fully, and all styles of play averages are. The main purpose of HowLongToBeat is literally to tell you how long it will take you to beat a game, which can be useful if you&#x27;re quite particular about how you plan your time.


Of course, games listed on there aren&#x27;t guaranteed to be the length of time listed, because it&#x27;s all based on user data. On the main site it will tell you the average, median, rushed, and leisurely times for each category, which will generally be a better indicator of how long you personally will take to complete a game.

                              <span>We already have the Dark Souls of board games (Dark Souls The Board Game), but now, unsurprisingly, there&#x27;s an Elden Ring board game on the way.


Steamforged Games, who also made the Dark Souls board game, announced on its website that an Elden Ring board game adaptation is in the works. Like its Dark Souls predecessor, it is quite simply called Elden Ring The Board Game, though not much about the board game itself has been revealed as of yet. The game is planned to be funded via Kickstarter, which you can sign-up to be notified when it launches.


&quot;In a vast, sprawling world of decaying grandeur that unfolds through your exploration, you&#x27;ll embark on a huge and varied adventure, visiting iconic locations and crossing paths with familiar enemies and characters,&quot; reads the description, also confirming up to four players will be able to play together.

                              <span>Xbox head Phil Spencer was recently reminded that he said Final Fantasy 14 should be coming to Xbox, and that&#x27;s apparently still the plan.


Coming up to three years ago, Spencer did promise that the team at Xbox was working with director Naoki Yoshida and co to bring the game to Xbox One. Well, we&#x27;ve got a whole new generation of Xbox consoles now, and still now catgirls or Paladins in sight. Now, as reported by Game Watch (translations by VGC), Spencer has reiterated his commitment to bringing the game to the platform.


&quot;We certainly announced that (laughs),&quot; said Spencer. &quot;Naturally, we haven’t given up yet. This is a commitment from both Microsoft and Square Enix to gamers and we will continue to coordinate our efforts.&quot;

PlayStation itself confirmed the news earlier this week on its official Twitter account (September 16), writing &quot;Sharpen your needles – confirming Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to PS5 and PS4.&quot; Of course, this being Silksong news, that&#x27;s about as far as the update stretches, but it is good to know that the game will be coming to a range of platforms at the very least.


Earlier this year at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, we got another snippet of Silksong gameplay, confirming that the game would also be coming to Xbox consoles, though didn&#x27;t specify which. It was also announced that the game would be on Game Pass day one though, a big win for subscribers to the service. But there&#x27;s been no mention of whether it will be available on any of the PlayStation Plus expanded tiers.

                              <span>One Piece Odyssey finally has a release date, as confirmed in a new trailer that says it will launch January 13, 2023.


Announced in a new trailer from Bandai Namco at Tokyo Game Show, fans of the Straw Hat Crew will be able to join the lovable pirates in their next video game adventure in just a few months. The new trailer sets up some of the story in the game, which unsurprisingly takes away the powers of each of the characters. As in many Shonen anime, the crew is quite overpowered these days, so you&#x27;ve got to do something to nerf them at the start of the game.


The Straw Hat Crew will have to collect cubes in order to regain their powers, though the trailer being mostly cinematics, it didn&#x27;t show exactly how you&#x27;ll be doing that.

Earlier today, a large number of videos and screenshots of what looks to be an early build of what is presumably an early build of GTA 6 have cropped up online. If these leaks are real, what has been shown lines up with what Bloomberg reported earlier this year on the upcoming sequel from Rockstar.


GTA 6, or whatever the next game in the series will be called, was confirmed to be in active development. Rockstar is yet to share any information on what the game is set to be like, but according to Bloomberg&#x27;s report, the sequel will once again feature two protagonists, one being a Latina woman, a first for the series.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Gran Turismo movie is ramping up, as it casts Lord of the Rings&#x27; Orlando Bloom and Stranger Things&#x27; David Harbour.


Earlier this year Sony announced that it would be making a Gran Turismo movie, which is certainly a choice for a series that isn&#x27;t exactly known for its narrative. Now, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Stranger Things and Black Widow star David Harbour will be joining the film, though details of his role haven&#x27;t been shared yet. And soon after, it was announced that Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean star Orlando Bloom has also been cast in the film.


District 9 and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp is set to direct the project, with a screenplay from Jason Hall (American Sniper). On the production side, PlayStation Productions Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan will produce alongside Doug Belgrad, and Dana Brunetti. A Gran Turismo movie has actually been in development since 2013, but it&#x27;s unclear if this is meant to be the same film, or another attempt at making one.

You can&#x27;t buy one yet for Valve&#x27;s PC gaming handheld, but they&#x27;re on the way, and Valve have had them on display for the first time during this week&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show.

I enjoyed it plenty when I reviewed it this past week, despite not being the biggest fan of heavy metal music. I may enjoy it even more in future, since its developers announced that they&#x27;re going to support music modding soon.

Thankfully some modders have stepped in to fill the void. There&#x27;s now a publicly playable beta of Half-Life 2: VR Mod available on Steam that makes the nearly 20-year-old shooter playable with a headset and motion controllers.

                              <span>Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game&#x27;s upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she&#x27;s all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It&#x27;s not yet clear what role Lady D&#x27;s castle has to play in Rose&#x27;s journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren&#x27;t for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling.

I feel I wasted this summer a bit and as much as I do like autumn, I really am not ready for the winter which will follow. Why do I always let my holiday days slide down and clump at the end of the year. Better make the most of comfortable swimming and cycling while I still can.

Future, which has put effective altruism back in the news.  That plus the
decision by GiveWell to
remove GiveDirectly from their top charity list got me thinking about
charity again.  I think effective altruism, by embracing long-termism, is
falling into an ethical trap, and I&#x27;m going to start heavily discounting
their recommendations for donations.


Background
Charity
Navigator measure overhead and (arguable) waste, but they don&#x27;t ask
whether the on-the-ground work of the charity has a positive effect
proportional to the resources it&#x27;s expending.
This is a good question to
ask.



GiveWell is a charity research
organization that directs money for donors based on effective altruism
principles.  It&#x27;s one of the central organizations in effective altruism.

A few days ago somebody asked me and I think it is an often requested to perhaps all fiction readers as to why we like fiction? First of all, reading in itself is told as food for the soul. Because, whenever you write or read anything you don’t just read it, you also visualize it. And that visualization is and would be far greater than any attempt in cinema as there are no budget constraints and it takes no more than a minute to visualize a scenario if the writer is any good. You just close your eyes and in a moment you are transported to a different world. This is also what is known as ‘world building’. Something fantasy writers are especially gifted in. Also, with the whole parallel Universes being a reality, it is just so much fertile land for imagination that I just cannot beli…</span>

                              <span>The server running this blog is a RockPro64 sitting in my living room. Besides WordPress (the blogging software), I run various other services on it:
Bepasty for sharing files,
Ikiwiki for taking notes,
Quassel for staying connected to IRC chat servers,
Radicale for synchronizing my calendar and tasks,
Shaarli for sharing bookmarks, and
Tiny Tiny RSS for reading other people’s blogs.




Most of these are for my personal use, and a few of them have pages for public viewing (linked at the top of this page).
Despite running a server, I don’t really consider myself to be a system administrator (or “sysadmin” for short). I generally try to avoid doing system administration work as much as possible. I think this is due to a number of reasons:

                              <span>In June I caved and bought a Prusa
Mini
3D printer for home. I bought it just before an announced price hike. I went
for a Prusa because of their reputation for &quot;just working&quot;, and the Mini mostly
as its the cheapest, although, the print area (7&quot;³) is large enough for most of
the things I am likely to print.






To get started, at the same time I bought some Prusament recycled
PLA to print
with which, unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed with.
I was attracted to the idea of buying a recycled material and Prusa make a lot
about the quality of their filaments.
The description was pretty clear that the colour would be somewhat random and
vary throughout the spool, but I didn&#x27;t mind that, and I planned to use it for
mainly functional prints where the precise colour didn&#x27;t matter. The colour
examples from the product page were mostly off-white grey with some tint,
typically green. There are not a lot of reviews of the recycled PLA that
comment on the colour of their spools, but in a couple of youtube videos
(1,
2) the spools have looked a
grey-ish silver, sometimes with a greenish tint, pretty similar to the product
page.
The colour I got is quite unlike those: it&#x27;s a dull brown, with little flecks
of glitter, presumably originally from recycling something like Galaxy
Black.
That&#x27;s totally within &quot;spec&quot;, of course, but it&#x27;s a bit boring.


Brown recycled Prusament PLA on the right
In terms of quality, sadly I&#x27;ve ended up with had at least one tangle in the
spool wind so far. There&#x27;s at least two reviews on their own product page from
people who have had similar difficulties.
Edit:
I realised after I wrote this post that I hadn&#x27;t actually
written much about the printer. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m still in the early days of
using it. In short I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very high quality machine, very pleasant to
use. Since I also went on a tangent about the recycled Prusament, the tone of
the whole post was more negative than I intended. Watch this space for some
more positive Prusa news soon!</span>

Universal Base Image (UBI) is an initiative where you can obtain, share and
build upon official Red Hat container images without needing a Red Hat
subscription. They&#x27;re exactly the same base images that Red Hat products are
built upon, composed entirely of Open Source software. Your precise rights are
covered in the
EULA.
Nowadays we offer two flavours of images, the original style (now termed
builder images) and leaner runtime images, which have a subset of the JDK,
and no build tools like Maven, etc.
We provide JDK11 and JDK17 for UBI9:

Speaking in a Squak Box segement with CNBS Asia, Xbox boss Phil Spencer confirmed Microsoft has no plans to increase the price of its Xbox Series consoles.
&quot;We are always evaluating our business going forward, so I don&#x27;t think we can say on everything that we will never do something, Spencer said around the 3:45 mark. &quot;But when we look at our consoles today, we think value is increibly inportant. We love the position of Series S in the market which is our lower cost console, half of our news players are coming in with Series S.

Speaking in an interview with Barrons, Zampella said the team behind the game may have also been a bit too ambitious.
“I think they just strayed a little too far from what Battlefield is,” he said (via VGC). “They tried to do a couple of things that were maybe ambitious: grow the player count, etc. I don’t think they spent enough time iterating on what makes that fun.

Speaking in an interview with Tojo Dojo, Yokoyama said the reason the studio didn&#x27;t opt for English dubs comes down to how people &quot;talked during the Bakumatsu era.&quot;
&quot;For the Ishin remake, we’re using subtitles,&quot; said Yokoyama. &quot;We’re not dubbing voiceovers. We’re translating the game into English, but the specialized vocabulary and the way people talked during the Bakumatsu era would make the lines incredibly long, so it just wouldn’t work. So this time we are doing subtitles.

Sony has confirmed that PSVR games will not be playable on PSVR2.
The news comes from the most recent PlayStation Podcast in which Hideaki Nishino, Sony&#x27;s senior VP of platform experience, broke the bad news (thanks, Gematsu).

It&#x27;s been three years since Spencer first mentioned plans to bring Square Enix&#x27;s fan-favourite MMO to Xbox and while there&#x27;s been no movement, Spencer gave &quot;a commitment&quot; that the company was still trying to make it happen.

&quot;Hahaha, I did say that,&quot; he laughed when asked by Game Watch if he remembered talking about it way back in 2019.

                              <span>Valve is showing off Steam Deck&#x27;s unreleased dock at Tokyo Game Show.

Though the Steam Deck Steam page mentions the dock and still invites interested players to wishlist the item, we&#x27;ve not seen nor heard much about it since Valve began shipping its sought-after handheld system.

As spotted by NME, Valve has the dock on display at Tokyo Game Show, giving fans a chance to check out the new kit and count - and argue about - those all-important ports on the back, which crucially  seem to show just one USB-C port, which is for the power cable.

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn has nerfed the Heat Sink skin iron sights and says it is &quot;improving the competitive integrity of iron sights now and in the future&quot;.

In an update posted to the game&#x27;s official website (via Reddit), Respawn responded to players&#x27; reports that some of the battle royale&#x27;s weapon skins offered an unfair competitive advantage when aiming down sights.

&quot;Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends,&quot; Respawn said. &quot;As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in the sights functionality as well.

                              <span>Steam Deck may well be the most mainstream example of the handheld gaming PC, but Valve is certainly not the first company to give the concept a shot. Other manufacturers got there first and continue to innovate with intriguing products. The AyaNeo Air is the most exciting of those handhelds yet, in that it&#x27;s something of an anti-Deck. The Air is small and easy to handle in the way that Steam Deck is not. It has the OLED panel with the inky blacks and incredible contrast that the Deck&#x27;s mediocre IPS LCD does not. Also - for good or bad - it runs on Windows 11, meaning that it plays everything, something that remains beyond the Deck when running the default Steam OS. 
First impressions are compelling, exactly because of its miniature form factor, like a kind of hybrid between Switch, Switch Lite and PlayStation Vita. But it&#x27;s at this point we should point out that there are actually two versions of the AyaNeo air - a standard model with a 28Wh battery and a thicker, heavier Pro model with a 38Wh variant. Battery life, as we shall discover, is a real problem on the standard machine. 
What both have in common are the same basic aesthetics, the same excellent analogue sticks and face buttons, the same lovely display and the same SD card reader. I found the shoulder triggers a little &#x27;spongy&#x27; for my tastes while the shoulder buttons feel a little insubstantial but there are some genuine nice ideas here, such as USB-Cs top and bottom, both capable of charging.

                              <span>Like a Dragon: Ishin will only feature Japanese voice acting, producer Masayoshi Yokoyama has confirmed.

In an interview with Yakuza fan site Tojo Dojo, Yokoyama revealed that whilst the Yakuza series has sometimes offered English voice-acting, Like a Dragon: Ishin&#x27;s &quot;specialised vocabulary [...] would make the lines incredibly long&quot;, so the game will be translated into English via subtitles.

“No, [Western players] don’t really watch subtitled content,&quot; Yokoyama acknowledged in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;Especially in English speaking countries. That’s why they prefer to have voice overs.

                              <span>PUBG: Battlegrounds&#x27; latest update, 19.2, is now live across all platforms bringing a new vehicle and weather system to Deston, an animation refresh and, ahem, the chance to &quot;race to your next chicken dinner in style&quot;.

The new &quot;special collaboration&quot; with McLaren will run until 1st November for PC players and 9th for those PUBG-ing on console, and introduce a load of McLaren flavoured goodies, including a McLaren GT Standard - Onyx Black vehicle skin, costume, gear, emote, and &quot;more via in-game McLaren Loot Caches&quot;.

Players can also tart up the Coupe RB with McLaren skins &quot;through the new vehicle interaction feature&quot; although fair warning: the skins &quot;do not affect the performance of the vehicle&quot;. Sorry.

The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There&#x27;s also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that&#x27;s available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

There, you can find a 32GB kit of DDR5-5600 CL36 memory for $150, reduced from its normal price of $180. That&#x27;s more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you&#x27;re getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

Reminisce fondly about the days of gliding on roller skates with your gun slap bang in the middle of your screen by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Man, I was worried this week. I&#x27;ve had a string of possible reports that were all disappointingly tepid. Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I&#x27;m still not sure if he&#x27;s talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

An in-game celebration of all things Bavarian that’s riffing on the actual Oktoberfest, Arktoberfest runs until October 3rd. It’ll bring themed festival foods to the game, along with some staggeringly well-balanced beer steins. Arktoberfest is the first big event to come to Lost Ark in the West that wasn&#x27;t in the original Korean and Russian version of the game.

In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

                              <span>Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a &quot;GeForce Beyond&quot; show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

                              <span>Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a &#x27;sad, middle-aged dad&#x27; look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom&#x27;s UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu&#x27;s been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

While there’s some new monsters to square off against, I feel the most critically important part of the update is the layered weapons system. This gives you the option to unsheathe some truly bizarre weaponry, including something that appears to be a comically huge ear of sweet corn. Witness for yourself by watching the trailer below.

Your adventure unfolds by making decisions using cards which represent allies, resources, and events, which often have weird and surprising consequences. Weirdly, the game it most reminds me of is Townscaper: throw pieces together, uncertain what will happen, then be surprised and delighted what the system produces. Like accidentally making your cowboy confess his love for his horse, leading to a fresh new baby horse card in your hand. Oh no.

The beta will feature crossplay across Steam and current-gen consoles. How have Capcom chosen to announce this? With a bunch of lads dancing around with boxes on their heads, that’s how. Check out the truly bizarre yet swagger-laden trailer below.

                              <span>I’ve always thought each of the sixteen colossi in Shadow Of The Colossus is kinda cute in their own special way. There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant.

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment head and Battlefield franchise boss Vince Zampella has spoken about the reception - and failure - of the series&#x27; most recent entry, Battlefield 2042, suggesting it &quot;strayed too far from&quot; its roots.


Battlefield 2042 was dogged by technical issues and controversial design decisions when it launched last year, quickly attracting overwhelmingly negative reviews from players on Steam.


Since then, developer DICE has continued to tweak and expand on Battlefield 2042&#x27;s wobbly base, but it&#x27;s often felt like too little, too late - with publisher EA admitting the game&#x27;s sales &quot;did not meet expectations&quot;, saying, &quot;Some of the design choices we made...did not resonate with everyone in our community&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has revealed its upcoming PSVR2 headset for PlayStation 5 won&#x27;t be compatible with games for the original PSVR.


That&#x27;s according to PlayStation&#x27;s SVP of platform experience, Hideaki Nishino, speaking in the latest episode of the Official PlayStation Podcast (jump to the 29:10 mark). &quot;PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2,&quot; he explained in answer to a question from the host, &quot;because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience&quot;. 


Elaborating further, Nishino claimed the new elements of the PVSR2 hardware - inside-out tracking and eye-tracking, 3D audio, a 4K HDR display, and its controller with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback - meant &quot;developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR.&quot;

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 closed beta announcement, Capcom has now revealed the full 18-strong character roster coming to the fighting series&#x27; latest instalment on launch day.


Previously, Capcom had confirmed 11 of the characters set to be playable in Street Fighter 6, offering a mix of familiar faces and brand-new additions. The iconic likes of Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, and Guile were all confirmed to be in, alongside more recent additions Juri and Luke. And as for newcomers, &quot;self-styled Chinatown peacekeeper&quot; Jamie and &quot;devoted student to Bushinryu&quot; Kimberly were both confirmed to be along for the ride.


As of today, though, that earlier 11-strong line-up has seen seven more additions, with Capcom having now announced Street Fighter 6&#x27;s full launch day roster. Series stalwarts Zangief, Cammy, and Dee Jay are all present and correct, and the list of newcomers is complete with Manon, Marisa, Lily, and JP.

                              <span>There&#x27;s good news for PlayStation-owning fans of developer Team Cherry&#x27;s sublime Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.


Hollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it&#x27;ll offer a twist on its predecessor&#x27;s non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.


Given how very excellent the original Hollow Knight was, that&#x27;s still more than enough to warrant excitement, and Switch, Xbox, and PC players have been able to rest easy knowing Silksong would - eventually, at least - be available on their system to play.

                              <span>After nearly eight years in development, an ambitious VR mod for Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter Half-Life 2 finally launches on Steam today as a public beta.


Created by a group of modders going by the name of Source VR Mod Team, Half-Life 2: VR Mod has had a bit of a bumpy journey to release. Eurogamer first reported on the project back in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra in 2013. Some time after, it disappeared into what the team recently called &quot;its own kind of development hell&quot;, almost being abandoned, but eventually re-emerged in 2021.


The wait continued until last month, when Source VR Mod Team announced that, thanks to a &quot;new influx of team members [that] revitalised&quot; development, the Half-Life 2: VR project was poised to release, and that day is now here.

There are two new trailers for us to digest, so let&#x27;s get into it!

A gameplay trailer, posted on the Japanese Like a Dragon YouTube channel, focuses on Ryoma Sakamoto&#x27;s (or Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s historical counterpart) fighting styles (embedded below).

                              <span>Nintendo finally confirmed the title of its Breath of the Wild sequel this week - after previously saying it was keeping the name secret as it was too much of a spoiler. 


The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was named on screen during the latest Nintendo Direct - but many fans still had questions.


Namely, was that &quot;tears&quot; as in crying? Or &quot;tears&quot; as in something being torn up?

Announced as part of Tokyo Game Show, the developer also shared a new concept trailer (below) for us all to pore over. 


Here, the Genshin Impact team stated: &quot;Let&#x27;s step into this vast magical world of adventure together! The long-term collaboration project between Genshin Impact and ufotable has begun.&quot;

                              <span>We learned this week that brilliant GameCube role-playing game Tales of Symphonia was getting a re-release on modern consoles - but fans have now expressed disappointment at the fact it will run at a locked 30fps. 


The detail, listed on the game&#x27;s new Japanese website, has raised eyebrows since Symphonia on GameCube was presented in largely 60fps (with 30fps only for the world map).


Instead, this new remaster features a blanket 1080p 30fps across all three platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a blockbuster week thanks to Tokyo Game Show 2022 and showcases from the likes of Nintendo and Sony.

With so many announcements, it&#x27;s easy to get lost in what&#x27;s already out and what&#x27;s available when. 

Here&#x27;s a quick reminder of everything new that was announced for Game Pass this week.

                              <span>There&#x27;s prolific, and then there&#x27;s Team Ninja. No sooner had I wrapped up an evening with the demo of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty - a demo that&#x27;s just gone live to all on PlayStation 5 - than the news broke of another in its long line of action games with Rise of the Ronin. And all this before I&#x27;ve even had the chance to finish the team&#x27;s take on Final Fantasy, Strangers of Paradise, or even managed to fully get my head around what exactly Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is. 


There&#x27;s plenty that&#x27;s familiar in Wo Long, though, both from the Nioh games it builds upon - themselves a pair of hard-edged, deeply enjoyable spins on the action RPG template laid out by FromSoft&#x27;s Souls games - and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s broader history with the Three Kingdoms periods. Because, in the simplest terms possible, Wo Long is Nioh transposed to the mythology and legends of third century China. 


It&#x27;s more than that, though, with an all-new approach to combat and an entirely different feel to it all. Nioh was a game of studied composure, and one that rewarded consideration in your attacks. Wo Long, on the other hand, flows like water and invites you to lose yourself in its combat, pulling you through its stages with a momentum quite unlike that which you&#x27;d associate with your typical Soulslike. It&#x27;s not quite a musou - that brand of crowd-clearing action that Koei Tecmo has made a craft of over the past 20 years - but it weaves in some ideas with its morale system that sees you conquering the map to earn more power.  The end result is something that feels surprisingly novel.

                              <span>A mod for Cyberpunk 2077 enables Night City&#x27;s vehicles to take to the skies.


The mod in question comes from Jack Humbert on Nexus Mods (via PC Gamer). Named &#x27;Let there be flight&#x27;, this mod &quot;enables a configurable flight system for all vehicles with custom thruster models, visual &amp; sound effects, and animations.&quot;


This adds something to Cyberpunk 2077 that many had hoped would have been included on the game&#x27;s initial release almost two years ago.

Speaking overnight to CNBC, Spencer noted the current economic issues many were facing, and said Xbox didn&#x27;t think it &quot;was the right move for us at this point&quot; to follow suit.


&quot;In a time when our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move for us at this point to be raising prices on our consoles,&quot; Spencer said.

                              <span>Indie tycoon game Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo will be making its way to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox via Game Pass on 29th September.


&quot;It&#x27;s time to Build a Zoo,&quot; reads the press release. &quot;Construct and decorate enclosures, buy and breed animals, hire zookeepers and vets... then try your hand at DNA splicing, and stitch together over 500,000 different types of animal. This can only go smoothly...&quot;


Splicing, did you say? Well, yes, yes I did! In Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, players can quite literally mix things up during any given playthrough. On its console release, new players will be able to exhibit a whole myriad of unusual beings. After all, who wouldn&#x27;t want to see a crocoduck if the opportunity presented itself.

                              <span>As the spat intensifies between Sony and Microsoft over the latter&#x27;s impending Activision Blizzard buyout, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has given his thoughts on the matter to US TV.


Spencer appeared on CNBC overnight and was questioned over Sony&#x27;s recent comments on the deal - including pushback from PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who previously branded Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances around the future of Call of Duty as &quot;inadequate&quot;. 


When asked whether Microsoft was prepared to go further than its recently-stated pledge - to keep COD on PlayStation for several more years - and perhaps promise it would remain on PlayStation in perpetuity, Spencer said his expectation was that Xbox would &quot;continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation and other places&quot;.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 has been doing better on Steam recently, with a steady increase in player count now making it one of the most played single-player games on the platform. 

It feels a bit wild to be making this statement nearly two years after the game came out.

According to SteamDB, yesterday the number concurrent players in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam peaked at 37,000, beating out Elden Ring on 31,000 and mostly topped by titles with a huge multiplayer base such as Grand Theft Auto 5 and Destiny 2.

Speaking to IGN about the upcoming game, de Fondaumiere shared that, while with each new title the studio does &quot;try to innovate&quot; and &quot;explore new ground&quot;, Quantic Dream will always retain various aspects of their games in future releases.


&quot;With Star Wars Eclipse we&#x27;re certainly going to keep the fundamental elements of a Quantic Dream game,&quot; he explained.

And they are: Earthworm Jim, Alisia Dragoon, and The Story of Thor (known as Beyond Oasis in the US).


Earthworm Jim is the most well known of these, a 90s character platformer about a humanoid worm in a space suit (look, it was the &#x27;90s...), but don&#x27;t sleep on those other two.

French publisher Microids announced the imminent release of Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission, officially licensed by Taito and due out on consoles this autumn. It&#x27;s also coming to VR in 2023.


All we have on this new game for now is a handful of screenshots, below, which show a new cartooney art style compared to the cult classic late-&#x27;80s arcade shooter. I&#x27;m sure this one&#x27;s going to prove divisive.

                              <span>Hello! Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we&#x27;ve found ourselves playing over the last few days. This time: laundry, guild problems, and back to hell.
If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
Apparently, I&#x27;m drawn to doing mundane things. Perhaps I&#x27;m inherently boring. I just can&#x27;t get enough of tidying up, though, or folding someone&#x27;s clothes, or washing them. Or cleaning the toilet, and I never thought I&#x27;d write that. And I know that isn&#x27;t really the point of Arcade Paradise - the point is growing an arcade out the back - but it&#x27;s the mundane half of the game in the laundrette that really balances me, and the game, out. Beautiful monotony - something to gently latch a restless mind onto and occupy my hands with.

                              <span>Outer Wilds, the stellar time loop adventure - and Eurogamer Game of the Year 2019 - from developer Mobius Digital, has just received a next-gen upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Outer Wilds, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, casts players as tentative space explorers, slinging them into a miniature solar system of bizarre planets, absolutely stuffed with secrets. There&#x27;s little direction, only a breadcrumb trail of clues hinting at a much larger mystery, and it all gradually opens out into glorious puzzle box, as ingenious as it is hauntig. And that&#x27;s even before you start to grapple with the ramifications of the solar system resetting itself every 20 minutes.


It&#x27;s great, then, but while Outer Wilds has technically been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S before now via backward compatibility, &quot;playing...was not recommended because players could run into sections that weren’t optimised for the next-gen consoles, and encounter other backwards compatibility issues such as controller input lag&quot; - as Mobius explains in a new post.

                              <span>PC graphics card manufacturer EVGA has announced that it will terminate making all GPU hardware at the end of this current hardware generation, following a large-scale falling out with GPU tech titan Nvidia. 


In a move that is likely to have significant repercussions across the PC gaming hardware industry, EVGA isn’t just dropping Nvidia - it also has no plans to move into creating GPUs with either AMD or Intel, Nvidia’s two key rivals. Instead, the company, which is well-known for making high-quality cards at reasonable prices, will quit the GPU business entirely.


The news was delivered today by a small number of hardware specialist media in various detailed reports, the best of which can be found over at the brilliant GamersNexus on YouTube (and embedded below). These outlets were directly briefed by EVGA, which confirmed that despite building prototype and test cards based on Nvidia’s upcoming 40-series GPUs, it wouldn’t be proceeding with those products - or any further Nvidia products.

                              <span>Project L — the 2 vs 2 fighting game lined up as industry giant Riot Games&#x27; next big release — is still a ways out. There’s no release date yet, only a handful of characters, and via our last major update we know the team have only just locked in the foundational gameplay and have moved onto full-on feature and character creation. The reality of people jumping on stage to play Project L for money is still a distant vision. However, does this mean Riot Games haven’t been setting up the groundwork? No way mate - I certainly didn’t think so.
As such, since I was in Sweden for the LEC Summer Finals where the best European teams were battling it out in top-of-class League of Legends, I thought it best to do some digging. Sitting across from me in a curtained interview room was senior director of esports for the EU Alberto Guerrero, who was the perfect person to question about what their plans were for Riot&#x27;s yet-to-be-release fighting game, what they had done in this primordial pre-release stage, and what special stuff they had in mind for the Fighting game community (FGC).
But why should anyone care? Sure Riot Games is working on its fighting game right now, but why does its future esports vision actually matter to those who play fighting games right now? Well, it doesn&#x27;t take a fortune teller to predict that Project L will send shockwaves across the genre. It&#x27;s free to play, which means it&#x27;ll have a strong initial base, and with pre-existing Riot Games fans — and Riot Games money — behind it, how it stands on the big stage will likely influence or outright alter how other developers and publishers approach their own titles.

                              <span>Omega Strikers has just been announced! Odyssey Interactive has just shown off its premier title, with former staff from a range of industry giants including Riot Games among senior staff. A 3v3 competitive sports x fighting game, you can apply to enter the closed beta right now.
While only playable on the PC right now, news of future mobile and console versions are apparently on the way. So if you like the look of the trailer below, but the sight of a keyboard deeply frightens you, hopefully the wait shouldn’t be that bad.
The gameplay is all about two teams of three smashing eachother off the arena in order to clear the path for a shot on goal. It’s like a sci-fi version of what you wish football really was when you were a teen, where you could just smash into the lad who actually spent his free time doing exercise and footy practice.

                              <span>What would the gaming community be like without Twitter? No, wait, don’t sarcastically post that Simpsons “A World Without Lawyers” clip in response – I’m serious. A lot of us grouse and gripe about it, but as a platform, it’s become hugely important to gaming and hardcore gamers. I’d even go so far as to say that it’s indispensable.
Fans use it to celebrate and complain. Developers and media form little Twitter bubbles where they socialize and hang out. During covid lockdowns, Twitter became a primary networking and communication tool, and, more importantly, a way to catch up with people for vital sanity-checks. The gaming news cycle is now practically built around Twitter; if you want the news first, that’s where you’ll go. If we’re lucky, the hot tweet will point you to the full write-up on VG247. Twitter has changed how the gaming industry functions. 
And Twitter knows it, too. The company believes that 71% of Twitter users play games, and 47% of its user base see watching people play games on platforms like Twitch as a form of entertainment. Gaming is massive on the platform, with the first half of 2022 seeing 1.5 billion Tweets on gaming topics – a new record, mapping to about 96 hot takes a second. That’s a whole lot of wrong opinions and console warring. As a result, it’s not a surprise to hear where Twitter sees itself.

The update sets the stage for the previously announced return of Flaming Espinas from Monster Hunter Frontier and the reveal of Violet Mizutsune. This creature emits bubbles that are filled with combustible gas that can erupt into an inferno of white-hot flame.

                              <span>As a vital piece of the Final Fantasy 7 lore and universe, it always seemed inevitable that Square Enix would somehow re-release Crisis Core, the FF7 prequel that first released for PSP in 2007. The release, which FF7 steward Tetsuya Nomura says promoted internal discussion about whether it’d qualify as a remake or a remaster, does sort of defy categorization – but now I’ve played it for myself, I’m going to try anyway.

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion is a remaster. It’s perhaps not quite ‘more than a remaster’, as Square Enix has suggested, but it’s a bloody impressive run at tidying up and improving a game that was on a handheld console that, ultimately, was less powerful than the PS2. 

In stills, Crisis Core definitely does look like more than a remaster, though. What you have here is low-key PS4 quality character models that wouldn’t look out of place in FF7 Remake proper dropped into the PSP game. In many cases, it seems like Square Enix has made clever use of the FF7 Remake asset – directly using some models and textures from that game, just back-porting them to this 2007 title. In stills, and even sometimes in motion in combat, it looks pretty damn impeccable.

                              <span>As Remy of Ratatouille once said, &quot;if you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff.&quot; Disney Dreamlight Valley is surprisingly good stuff, and I&#x27;m going to keep reaching for more and more plates until someone begs that I put it down.
I&#x27;m likely not alone in regards to this sentiment, either, with Disney Dreamlight Valley having raked in over 1 million players since launching ten days ago into early access. The news was shared directly via the game&#x27;s Twitter account, reading &quot;We&#x27;re overjoyed to see you discover what it means to #LiveMagically. Thank you for your excitement, feedback and sharing the game with your friends. This is just the beginning!&quot;
Before anyone accuses me of being a Disney adult who&#x27;d obviously be all over this game, I&#x27;ve never been massively into Disney whatsoever. Sure, I&#x27;ve got an affinity towards borderline-cult classics such as Ratatouille, but I frankly couldn&#x27;t care less about things like Frozen and Tangled.

                              <span>We’ve not even known about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty –  the next game from the creators of Nioh – for that long. It was announced back at Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Games Showcase in June, and immediately caught the eye of everyone that’s got even a passing love for all things hardcore action-RPG.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is the new action title from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo (no, not Rise of the Ronin – we’re not going to see that for another few years yet), and in a series of trailers, it demonstrated how it immediately intends to separate itself from the developer’s previous Nioh games. 
There’s a jump button! There are no stances! You cannot ki pulse! It’s much quicker! It’s set in China instead of Japan! But it’s hard to divine any of what this actually means for the game, really, from trailers – no matter how flashy and well put-together they are. In a hands-on with the game’s first demo, though, I’ve been able to try it all out for myself… and let me tell you, the difference is as vast and important as FromSoftware’s was in the jump from Dark Souls to Bloodborne.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a banner week for Team Ninja: as well as debuting the stunning Rise of the Ronin at Sony&#x27;s State of Play showcase earlier this week, the Japanese developer has also launched a demo for its more immidiate upcoming game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.
We already knew that the new game, set in the Three Kingdoms-era of China&#x27;s dynastic history, was set to receive a demo &quot;in the near future&quot;, but thanks to the Tokyo Game Show, we can all enjoy it right now!
You need to be quick, though: the test isn&#x27;t sticking around for long (likley because you need to be online at all times to enjoy it). Don&#x27;t worry if you&#x27;ve not got an active Xbox Live or PS+ membership, though; the multiplayer option in this demo does not require a paid membership to the online services of each platform, per the publisher.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not common knowledge, but international mega star, Beyoncé, is a huge Assassin&#x27;s Creed fan. I&#x27;m quite surprised more hasn&#x27;t been made about this, given her influence, but now you know. Her 2006 stratospheric chart topper, Irreplaceable, was at one point all about Assassin&#x27;s Creed - a game she played an early build of and loved so much she simply had to pen a song about it, even before it hit stores.
The song, which went on to the biggest tune of 2007 in the US, originally talked about how the star loved Assassin&#x27;s Creed so much that it could never be replaced by another game. In a strange turn of events, however, Beyoncé has a phobia of flags, so was quite shocked to see so many in the game when she played it just prior to the release of Irreplaceable. This shocking twist resulted in the song hastily being rewritten to focus on a relationship, and the original song never saw the light of day.
Bizarrely, she also has an irrational dislike of first-party PlayStation exclusives.

The demo itself takes you back to where it all began, the Peterson house, for an early investigation as to what Hello Neighbor 2 could entail. Releasing on September 20, the demo is a completely standalone experience that will not spoil the full game, but simply prepare you for it.
It’s up to you to get to the bottom of what Mr. Peterson is hiding in Hello Neighbor 2, and on a much wider scope. In the open world of Raven Brooks, there is an entire towns worth of twisted mysteries to unravel. And with children continually going missing, you’re certain that Mr. Peterson has something to do with it.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is shaping up like it might be one of the greatest ever apologies in gaming history – and the world of video games is one where a lot of developers have had to make embarrassing admissions that their previous project was, y’know, a bit crap. I’ve always been a strong supporter of Street Fighter 5, and the fact that it got significantly better over time... but lord knows, the difference between SF5 and SF6 is night and day.

I’ve already played Street Fighter 6, of course. But this new sit-down, with a Tokyo Game Show build of the game, is a slightly updated and different build to the one I spent an hour or so with before. Here’s what’s new this time around:

I want to start out with what might seem like the least consequential piece of this updated build – the new commentators. And, well… I’m impressed? Commentary in video games is, of course, always a bit of a mixed bag. It repeats itself, it becomes stale, and it is often the subject of memes (especially in traditional sports games). But Street Fighter 6 has a canny solution to these ills – and it just might work.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is looking polished as hell - let’s make that clear from the off. It represents a massive course-correction from the controversial mis-steps of SFV, but it hasn’t jettisoned everything from the previous game: everything salvageable has been iterated and improved upon, resulting in a blend of SF4, SF5, and a breadth of new ideas.
Alex’s hands-on session with the Tokyo Game Show build focused on four newly revealed characters: the powerful but unwieldy Guile, for starters. Juri, whose SF6 incarnation is a refinement on her SF5 version but with some of her fan-favourite moveset brought in from SF4. Kimberly, an entirely new character for SF6 but with strong links to the wider Capcom lore.
And, lastly, Ken Masters; resplendent here in his “she’s turned the weans against us” era garb. Despite the divorcee-chic, though, it’s still the same old Ken: if he was your main in 1991, he’ll feel like being right back home again. Assuming she didn’t get the house.

                              <span>Activision and Infinity Ward showed off the multiplayer portion of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 today ahead of the open beta, which kicks off tomorrow.
One multiplayer feature the developers showed off was swimming and Aquatic Combat. Instead of dying when hitting the water like in previous games,  action now occurs above, on, and in water. Various elements will be present such as currents and waves, and the water can be clean, murky, polluted, or have debris. 
In the open beta, maps with water will showcase these enhancements, and you can use water as a stealth or escape mechanism. You can even change your stance or sprint and look down to plunge underwater. If you fire underwater using sidearms and certain equipment, your weapon’s projectile will be affected by the increased density, so you may need to change your aim. You will also need to pay special attention to Tactical items, and you may need to try all-new strategies when attacking boats, enemies below the water’s surface, or when you’re avoiding or deploying an explosive.

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games&#x27; pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it&#x27;s down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you&#x27;ll have to move fast to pick this one up...

                              <span>This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I&#x27;m able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren&#x27;t eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don&#x27;t actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

                              <span>One of the best 1000W computer power supplies is going cheap(er) on Amazon today, as the EVGA SuperNova 1000 P6 has dropped from £200 to £150. That&#x27;s an excellent price for a well-reviewed unit with 80+ Platinum efficiency and a fully modular design - not to mention a surprisingly compact ATX design that will work in a wide range of PC cases.

That’s the message from dev Toby Fox, who’s posted an update on how Deltarune’s coming along. Fox’s message to those eagerly awaiting more from the game was published to mark the seventh anniversary of his indie RPG smash Undertale. It shares some new screens, GIFs, a video and even some tunes.

                              <span>Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn&#x27;t been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we&#x27;ve now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn&#x27;t ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn&#x27;t a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you&#x27;ll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won&#x27;t succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

Oh, and there’s crossplay across all platforms and stores too. Watch the new trailer below.

Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

                              <span>Capcom has shared more details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s next free Title Update, which will introduce the likes of the Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos when it comes to Switch and PC on 29th September.


When Capcom previously discussed Title Update 2 at the end of last month, it confirmed that monster variant Flaming Espinas would be one ofits new additions. It&#x27;s now announced two additional variants for the release - the aforementioned Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos - both appering in its latest update trailer.


There&#x27;s not much information about the Violet Mizutsune just yet, but the Risen Chameleos is described as an Elder Dragon that has &quot;overcome the affliction by achieving symbiosis with the Qurio, gaining great strength and new abilities&quot;. As such, it &quot;poses an even greater danger than when they were still under the influence of the affliction&quot; - so tread carefully.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking multi-character survival horror from acclaimed developer Santa Ragione - finally has a release date, and will be inviting PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players into its ever-shifting labyrinth on 27th October.


We&#x27;re big fans of Santa Ragione&#x27;s previous work, which includes MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, around these parts, and Saturnalia sounds just as intriguing. It&#x27;s a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.


The goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>Following tonight&#x27;s big Call of Duty blowout we finally have a release date for the much-anticipated Warzone 2.0 - plus we&#x27;ve plenty more details on what to expect. 


Warzone 2.0 is set to launch on 16th November, some two weeks after the launch of Modern Warfare 2 on 28th October. The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It&#x27;ll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone&#x27;s take on Escape from Tarkov. 


Like other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.

                              <span>Lego Bricktales, the beautiful diorama-based puzzler from developer ClockStone, finally has a release date and will be coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 12th October.


Announced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


The ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales&#x27; brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.

                              <span>Norco, the acclaimed Southern gothic adventure from developer Geography of Robots, will be making the jump from PC to PlayStation and Xbox next month, arriving on 20th October.


Norco unfolds in the &quot;sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps&quot; of a surreal, future South Louisiana, where players embark on a quest to find their brother, Blake - missing after the death of their mother.


What follows is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure, but one that aims in all sorts of directions, with Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell somewhat futilely summing it up as a &quot;text-adventure, turn-based party battler, boat-navigating... poem... puzzler?&quot; in his review.

Series veterans Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim and E. Honda were all confirmed as returning characters to the roster. Footage of the Battle Hub showed a game centre full of arcade cabinets for players to compete against one another.

                              <span>We&#x27;re back again this week for another Eurogamer Newscast, focusing on the recent Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play, plus the week&#x27;s big news on the Yakuza franchise and what&#x27;s next from Xbox Game Pass. It&#x27;s been a busy week - full of Zelda, Pikmin, God of War and Yakuza 8 - but some corners of the internet are disappointed.


True, we didn&#x27;t see some of the things we had expected might materialise. This week was not when we saw Wind Waker on Switch, Silent Hill on PlayStation, or got some kind of assurance Nintendo remembered what Metroid even was. But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t plenty to look forward to.

Join Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan for our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom theories, thoughts on new Switch hardware, and our expert opinion on where to start with Yakuza.

What exactly these powers were was never disclosed, with Rose revealing that &quot;even Chris&quot; didn&#x27;t know the full extent of what she could do thanks to her brush with the megamycete. 


However, a new trailer for Village&#x27;s The Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC has shown off more from its new story, Shadows of Rose, including what these powers are.


Shared as part of Capcom&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show presentation, this trailer reveals that Rose is actually able to freeze her enemies. So, very name appropriate.

Back in June, 343 discussed the idea of introducing Spartan Points, a premium currency to unlock items within the game.


The idea was that given there are over 1000 customisation items in MCC which were added over the years, it could be overwhelming for new players or those who only hop into the game occasionally.

The long-rumoured Resi 4 remake was finally unveiled back in June, and was initially announced for just PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Today, during a Tokyo Games Show livestream, Capcom said it had been working on securing a last-gen version of the game as well - and it had done so, but only for PS4.

                              <span>I had an interview with the team behind Plasma. Sadly, I listened back to the transcript and it&#x27;s fifteen minutes of me laughing with delight, while heavy aircraft are clearly going through maneuvers overhead. No matter. Plasma is dizzyingly complex, but very easy to explain. It&#x27;s an engineering sandbox game. You make stuff in a 3D world using pre-made parts and simplified code, and then you can share it with other people.


What kind of stuff? The team isn&#x27;t sure - as in, they aren&#x27;t sure where the boundaries are. People are going to make dioramas and games and working Babbage engines no doubt. Over the course of my interview I saw a working Pong machine, with a screen to play the game on and a decent run at the classic Pong cabinet. I saw a bunny robot with an emoji face and massive feet that kept falling over. I saw an articulated hand the size of a house that moved between waving and giving me a brisk thumbs-up. When doesn&#x27;t that add something to your day? Oh yes, and a horrible robot spider that had basic player-seeking capabilities. 


All of this in a 3D world with gentle hills, blue skies and green grass. But how does it work? To answer this I was shown a little remote control car that could be steered with a joypad. And then the developers made a second car, shaping basic blocks, putting on an engine and wheels and a device for programming steering, and then disappearing into a sort of drag-and-drop code space in which you can cobble together inputs and outputs, and tweak endlessly if that&#x27;s your thing.

                              <span>The news of the cancellation of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign co-op split-screen option has been frustrating - not least because I was looking forward to playing it with my son, just as I have with all prior Halo titles supporting the feature. The fact that 343 Industries isn&#x27;t supporting it is all the more confusing because right now at least, it&#x27;s possible to glitch your way into split-screen campaign co-op for up to four players. It&#x27;s true that the feature is not without its bugs, but in my experience, these are relatively minor and it&#x27;s possible to play through the entire campaign in split-screen mode. Adding to the sense of disappointment is how close 343 has got to finalising this feature - and it plays brilliantly.


To fully understand the story, we need to go back to 2017 when then-343 Industries head Bonnie Ross addressed the lack of split-screen campaign co-op in Halo 5, making this comment during the 2017 DICE summit: &quot;When we didn&#x27;t put split-screen in with Halo 5, I think it&#x27;s incredibly painful for the community - and for us. It erodes trust with the community, as the community is part of our world building... I would say for any FPS going forward, we will always have split-screen.&quot;


The situation changed a couple of weeks ago when 343&#x27;s head of creative, Joseph Staten announced the cancellation of the feature, suggesting that - to put it bluntly - finite resources were better deployed elsewhere: &quot;We had to make the difficult decision not to ship campaign split-screen co-op and take the resources we would use on that and go after this list and all these other things.&quot;

                              <span>A new update for the Xbox app on PC has added official integration of website HowLongToBeat.

If you haven&#x27;t used it before, HowLongToBeat is a community run website where people can log how long it took them to beat a certain game. The times are then averaged to provide a rough estimate of the game&#x27;s expected length.

It&#x27;s by no means sound scientifically, but it&#x27;s a nifty way of ballparking how much time you might need to finish a game&#x27;s story before you commit to playing (or buying) it.

Gunsmith was first introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) as a replacement of the attachment system used in preceding titles, and it&#x27;s been used in every game since. 


The system allows players to customise their weapons in greater detail, with multiple attachments, optics and of course, skins.

Meanwhile, developer Shedworks has said, thanks to the PS5&#x27;s DualSense controller, riding over the game&#x27;s sand dunes will be &quot;as immersive as ever&quot; with this release.

                              <span>Last night I got through two whole districts with almost no health, and no prospects. An early boss had whittled me down to almost nothing, so I lurched into the eternal night thinking - four health? This won&#x27;t last long. For comparison, I start with 300 health, and that&#x27;s rarely enough. But something happened. The City surprised me. I had a sort of unlikely cyberpunk cup run. Two whole districts on four health. I&#x27;m still thinking about it.
City Wars: Tokyo Reign is the kind of game that surprises me. It surprises me constantly, with great roguelite runs like last night&#x27;s, in which I almost gave up but ended up travelling further than I could have imagined. It surprises me as I see a new wrinkle in its endless unspooling strategies, as I find a new synergy in its cards. It surprised me at the start by filling me with raw enthusiasm for a collectible card game that was also a roguelite - hardly a genre mash-up in short supply. It surprised me that I could take its initially daunting rules and make them my own. City Wars makes CCGs fresh again - it has for me, anyway. I really hope you&#x27;ll play it too.
So let&#x27;s get the roguelite stuff out of the way. It&#x27;s a cyberpunk city filled with alleyways and midnight horrors. You choose a class and then get a randomised loadout of cards from your growing collection, a gun that works as a stats modifier, and a charm that gives you a perk of some kind.

The beta, which is set to go live tomorrow evening, is available to preload now for those who have pre-ordered the game. 


The most notable finding has been the option to adjust the &quot;3rd Person Field of View,&quot; which implies that the game will feature a third-person game mode, as well as an FOV slider on console.

Yokoyama made the statement in an interview with GameSpot yesterday and explained why the studio was reluctant to put Yakuza on Switch.

                              <span>The surprisingly brilliant PowerWash Simulator will soon arrive for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PS5.


PowerWash Simulator is a game about cleaning things - cars, helicopters, bungalows - that quickly becomes a compulsion. You complete jobs to upgrade your powerwash machine, then take on progressively bigger challenges. 


Pretty soon you&#x27;re hosing down whole skate parks, fairground rides, and a particularly grubby set of public toilets.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima is at it again.


The creator has recently set up a website, presumably for a new game, which features nothing more than a shadowy visage with the words &quot;Who Am I?&quot; written across the image.


Clicking on this image then gives you the option to share said picture across various social media feeds, something that Geoff Keighly has done. As such, the internet now expects whatever this new project of Kojima&#x27;s is to be fully unveiled at The Game Awards this December.

                              <span>The last day of Overwatch 1 will be 2nd October, Blizzard told me during an Overwatch 2 roundtable interview last night. (Note: this is from a Pacific Time point of view. With time differences, it could be 3rd October elsewhere in the world.) Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.
&quot;So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we&#x27;re going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers,&quot; commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. &quot;So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it&#x27;s a 27-hour downtime that we&#x27;re planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. 
&quot;We&#x27;ll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There&#x27;s also a couple of things that we&#x27;ll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We&#x27;ll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.

                              <span>Blizzard has explained in detail how the Overwatch 2 battle pass and associated monetisation will work. The information comes from a briefing document and roundtable group interview I attended last night.
There are no loot boxes in Overwatch 2, in case you didn&#x27;t know. In their place are a battle pass and in-game store, where you&#x27;ll directly buy what you want, using a new currency called Overwatch Coins.
The Overwatch 2 battle pass has two tiers, free and paid, and you will be able to unlock all new Overwatch 2 heroes on that free track. New heroes will be unlockable at tier 55, of around 80 total tiers.

The first-person single-player shooter, developed by Arkane Lyon, first released this time last year as a PlayStation 5 exclusive (as well as on PC).


The exclusivity raised eyebrows since the game&#x27;s publisher, Bethesda Softworks, was acquired by Microsoft earlier that year.

The reveal came during an unusually packed Tokyo Game Show livestream from Xbox, which also included Game Pass confirmations of the Ni No Kuni series, and an Xbox release date for Deathloop.


Odyssey is the Assassin&#x27;s Creed game set in Ancient Greece, and its deepest dive into the RPG genre. It&#x27;s a warm, enjoyable and expansive experience - and one of the highlights of the whole series.

Its follow-up, Ni No Kuni: Revenant Kingdom, will then also arrive for Xbox consoles and Game Pass in 2023, Microsoft confirmed today during its Tokyo Game Show 2022 livestream.

The new hero, Kiriko, will arrive alongside the game at release. As the newest Support hero, the character can teleport through walls to protect teammates using a healing ofuda. Kiriko can also dash towards enemies to take them out with a kunai.
When it comes to the Season One Battle Pass, Blizzard said it will be &quot;delivering more in one drop&quot; than it has delivered since the original game relesed in 2016. This includes three new heroes, which will all be available immediately to returning Overwatch players who log in during Season One or Season Two.

                              <span>League of Legends is an esports mountain, at this point. Over the years since Western professional gaming&#x27;s primordial days, it has broken through and risen through tectonic shifts in the global scene, eventually towering over the majority of its competitors both within its genre – and without. It has even reached the lofty heights required for your mum or dad to have heard about it.There&#x27;s a good chance that if you have a sister, she&#x27;s dated a mid-laner, god help her. Walking around town with a Fnatic or Evil Geniuses t-shirt can, in certain places, elicit a similar reaction that a football (real or American) jersey can. If I see a zoomer in an NA team&#x27;s merch, I&#x27;m likely to laugh at them. If I see someone in old-school Shalke attire, I&#x27;m liable to french kiss them.
But, those plates buried beneath this world of competitive video games keep grinding, resulting in Riot Games spreading its ever growing influence to new pastures that its crown-title simply cannot reach. Valorant has erupted in popularity since its release, with fans and players of its one most notable competitor (CS:GO) jumping ship and leaving only the loyal behind. Wild Rift, the League of Legends mobile game, appears to be building to similar heights, while  Legends of Runeterra is cutting out its own audience among hardcore card duelists. This once lone, daunting mountain has found itself a range of familial peaks.
This is, obviously, great for Riot and its base – but with titles like Project L and the distant Riot MMO on the way, what is the role of League of Legends in this modern landscape? Is it still as important, as paramount to the success of Riot esports? Is it as shiny as it used to be, surrounded by fresher, growing games?

                              <span>It’s been some time since the launch of World of Warcraft Classic’s Wrath of the Lich King pre-patch, an update which saw many of the popular servers, including fresh servers meant to give new and old players a totally green experience, suffering from some serious queue times that made actually jumping in and playing the game incredibly difficult. Now, Blizzard has put out a statement, but the consequences of their actions (or inaction) are starting to be felt.
This statement, released on the Blizzard forums around the time when queues were really horrendous, covers the issue and provides some context for the problem. In terms of solutions, Blizzard halted character creation and transferring to badly-affected mega servers, and locked them down “indefinitely”. This essentially stopped an increased influx of players making the queues worse, which when combined with free transfers off realms has appeared to curb the problem somewhat. 
However, even now, certain mega servers still retain large queues, especially once school and work hours come to a close and players return home for some dungeon grinding, or farming honor in continuous Alterac Valley runs. In the aforementioned post, it’s stated that “we need more folks to move”, but that’s unlikely to happen with certain crowds of Classic WoW players — especially on fresh servers.

                              <span>A hot new trailer for Street Fighter 6 was just dropped during Capcom’s Tokyo Game Show live stream, giving us a look at several returning world warriors, the battle hub, character creation in the single player mode, and the return of good ol’ fashioned car vandalism.
You can watch the trailer embedded below, which goes through each of the significant reveals in detail. As far as an update on Capcom’s next big fighter goes, this is a massive drop. However, with Ken looking a bit more grizzled rather than depressed, it does put the homeless Ken theories on a knives’ edge.
Let&#x27;s start with the characters. Blanka, Honda, Dhalsim and Ken were all revealed briefly in the trailer, with a quick montage of some of their special moves, supers, and presence in the story mode hastily presented to us in Street Fighter 6’s flashy hip-hop inspired style. It’s hard to tell, but a mix of recognisable moves as well as a few new ones can be seen, which is obviously good news for series veterans.

                              <span>Microsoft has added additional titles to Xbox Game Pass today, including Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered, Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony Anniversary Edition, Metal: Hellsinger, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey, and Fuga: Melodies of Steel. 
For those who have never played the lovely Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, the remastered version features enhanced graphics and performance for Xbox Consoles and PC. You owe it to yourself to give the game a try, especially if you are a Game Pass subscriber.
On October 13, Dyson Sphere Program will arrive on PC Game Pass, and the southern gothic point and click narrative adventure game Norco is coming soon to Xbox Game Pass (as well as PC, PS4, and PS5).

                              <span>The announcement that a remastered version of GoldenEye 007 is heading to Xbox was met with cheers – rightly, given it’s one of the best games of all time. Then the cheers gave way to confusion, and disappointment, as it was confirmed that the version of the game releasing on Xbox consoles won’t have online multiplayer – only the classic split-screen. 
In a weird twist, the Nintendo Switch version will have online play – but that release is basically an emulated version of the N64 release rather than a true remaster. It’s all a bit of a mess, and a bit of a disappointment. GoldenEye’s multiplayer is undoubtedly its most famous feature, and while it absolutely will forever be at its best when you’re crowded around a single screen – I also feel like online is a bit of a must in the year of our lord 2022. 

If you want to play GoldenEye multiplayer on Xbox, however, this is an option – and it’s been available since 2010.

The Xbox version comes with all updates released for the game since its release. The updates include photomode, additional accessibility options, cross-play matchmaking, and a multitude of quality-of-life fixes

                              <span>A short while ago, I played Kirby’s Dream Buffet. Following the announcement of the game, I was completely ecstatic. You’re telling me they’re putting my favourite pink puff ball into what, essentially, looks like a tasty version of Fall Guys? And it’s going to be co-op? And it’s on the Switch!?
I was ready to make Kirby’s Dream Buffet one of my games of choice at gatherings, placing it on the same pedestal as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. However, when I actually got my hands on the game, I was left disappointed.
The co-op features that I anticipated were missing. Kirby’s Dream Land felt limited, only allowing for two-player local co-op. Online, I could play with three more friends, but they would then need to buy the game – as well as have their own Switch device to hand. I had my qualms with the game outside of this, which landed a 2/5 in my review, but it was the lack of four-player local co-op that, to me, made the entire premise of the game feel a little redundant.

While those looking to play Warzone Mobile on iOS currently have no way to pre-register, it&#x27;s likely that they will open up today during or following the show.
Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile was only recently announced, but eager players saw that Android pre-registrations have opened on the Google Play Store. Clicking the button simply means you can pre-install it once it goes live, which is helpful in cases where the game is rolling out gradually.

                              <span>Guilty Gear: Strive and Blazblue Cross Tag Battle have both been announced for Xbox Game Pass, coming to PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S Spring 2023. This means that two of the best anime fighters out right now are both available for those with a Game Pass sub, easily accessible for those who want to learn some combos.
While both aren&#x27;t particularly new games, with Strive being around a year old and Cross Tag Battle having been hanging around for roughly 3 years now, they both have existing online communities that are bound to get a healthy injection of new fresh players thanks to both opening up to the Game Pass crowd.
Recently this year, both games were present at Evo 2022. Guilty Gear Stive had a second season of DLC characters announced alongside Bridget, a returning character from the series&#x27; past who was set live only days following their showing at the tournament. Unfortunately, Cross Tag Battle didn&#x27;t get any significant announcements along the same line.

                              <span>Call of Duty fans have a big show to look forward to today in Call of Duty: Next, a catch-all event that promises to bring us a tonne of new Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer details, show off gameplay for the first time, discuss what&#x27;s going on with Warzone 2.0, and even share a thing or two about Warzone: Mobile.
The format of today&#x27;s showcase will be similar to the Modern Warfare 2019 reveal event. Following the developer-lead presentations, over 150 streamers and content creators will be jumping in to play the beta ahead of its launch on Friday.
You&#x27;ll be able to go directly to their channels to watch each of their perspectives, or keep it to the main stream, which will be jumping between the different perspectives and offering commentary on the action as it plays out.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a rather hectic week of streams and reveals, with the Nintendo Direct and Sony&#x27;s State of Play being streamed on the same day. Now, it&#x27;s time for the Tokyo Game Show with even more exciting announcements, and already, it looks like 2023 is shaping up to be a good year for games.
As a part of the Tokyo Game Show, which runs from September 15 to September 19, Xbox will have its own livestream. There&#x27;s already been a lot to hear from Microsoft this past year, having hosted its own rather lively Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase in June this year. We got a long, hard look at Starfield and its thousands of planets, plus a further look at exciting titles like Redfall, Forza Motorsport, and Minecraft Legends.
The show goes on, though, and we can anticipate even more news from Xbox today!

                              <span>Ahead of today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next multiplayer showcase event, Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward finally unveiled one of the biggest new additions in the upcoming shooter: Gunsmith 2.0. The Gunsmith system, introduced in the 2019 Modern Warfare, was one of its defining features.
It allowed players to unlock an unprecedented number of attachments and experiment with weapon modifications to a level only seen in milsim shooters. That system has been revamped for Modern Warfare 2, and the developer explained what its goals are in a new video.
There are two key pillars to Gunsmith 2.0, which resemble the way Escape from Tarkov handles weapon creation. The first is Weapon Platforms, which encompass all the different possible variants (SMG, DMR, AR, etc.) that are born from a single platform.

                              <span>There has been a number of different efforts in recent time to further enhance the Linux kernel&#x27;s scheduler to better adapt to modern hardware architectures whether it be for Intel hybrid CPU designs, adapting to new CPU cache configurations, or just better scaling with today&#x27;s ever-increasing core counts. Another scheduler effort detailed this week is &quot;Nest&quot; that aims to keep tasks on &quot;warm cores&quot; with hopes of lower latency due to being already at higher clock/performance states and ideally operating at an optimal turbo/boost frequency. The Nest developers find that their scheduler &quot;improves performance 10%-2x and can reduce energy usage&quot; with modern hardware...</span>

                              <span>For a number of years Arm CPUs on the mainline Linux kernel have supported Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) as a means of providing the kernel&#x27;s scheduler with the information to influence its scheduling decisions based on the estimated energy consumed by the CPU cores. EAS employs an energy model for helping to place tasks between the big.LITTLE cores for optimal energy efficiency and a minimal impact on throughput. Intel has been working to eventually support Energy Aware Scheduling on their x86 hybrid CPUs too...</span>

                              <span>More ICFP-inspired experiments using the rec-def library: In Norman Ramsey’s very nice talk about his Functional Pearl “Beyond Relooper: Recursive Translation of Unstructured Control Flow to Structured Control Flow”, he had the following slide showing the equation for the dominators of a node in a graph:
He said “it’s ICFP and I wanted to say the dominance relation has a beautiful set of equations … you can read all these algorithms how to compute this, but the concept is simple”.
This made me wonder: If the concept is simple and this formula is beautiful – shouldn’t this be sufficient for the Haskell programmer to obtain the dominator relation, without reading all those algorithms?
Before we start, we have to clarify the formula a bit: If a node is an entry node (no predecessors) then the…</span>

                              <span>Last night I complained that git&#x27;s SSH signature format didn&#x27;t support using SSH certificates rather than raw keys, and was swiftly corrected, once again highlighting that the best way to make something happen is to complain about it on the internet in order to trigger the universe to retcon it into existence to make you look like a fool. But anyway. Let&#x27;s talk about making this work!
git&#x27;s SSH signing support is actually just it shelling out to ssh-keygen with a specific set of options, so let&#x27;s go through an example of this with ssh-keygen. First, here&#x27;s my certificate:
$ ssh-keygen -L -f id_aurora-cert.pub
id_aurora-cert.pub:
        Type: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com user certificate

                              <span>At this week’s International Conference on Functional Programming I showed my rec-def Haskell library to a few people. As this crowd appreciates writing compilers, and example from the realm of program analysis is quite compelling.
To Throw or not to throw
Here is our little toy language to analyze: It has variables, lambdas and applications, non-recursive (lazy) let bindings and, so that we have something to analyze, a way to throw and to catch exceptions:
type Var &#x3D; String

data Exp
  &#x3D; Var Var
  | Throw
  | Catch Exp
  | Lam Var Exp
  | App Exp Exp
  | Let Var Exp Exp

Given such an expression, we would like to know whether it might throw an exception. Such an analysis is easy to write: We traverse the syntax tree, remembering in the env which of the variables may throw an exception:

                              <span>In the operation of a normal Linux system there are many secrets stored on behalf of a user. Wifi passwords, passwords from web sites, etc. Ideally you want them to be quickly and conveniently accessible to the rightful user but also be as difficult as possible for hostile parties to access.
The solution in GNOME and KDE is to have a wallet that is encrypted to store such passwords, the idea is that if a hostile party gets access to a PC that doesn’t use full disk encryption then the secrets will be protected. This is an OK feature. In early versions it required entering a password every time you logged in. The current default mode of operation is to have the login password used to decrypt the wallet which is very convenient.
The problem is the case where the user login password has a scop…</span>

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Gran Turismo movie continues to progress, with Stranger Things star David Harbour having now joined the cast.


Sony&#x27;s live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Harbour is the first member of the cast to be officially revealed (thanks The Hollywood Reporter) and he&#x27;ll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who&#x27;s helming the project.


Blomkamp will be directing from a script by Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), which dramatises an apparently true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver.

And if you missed its typically meandering reveals, you can check out everything that put in an appearance, considerably more succinctly, below.

Eville


Eville is a multiplayer social deduction game from developer VestGames that&#x27;s coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 11th October. It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.

                              <span>Cities Skylines&#x27; 11th major expansion, Plazas and Promenades, has skipped the release date announcement pre-amble to surprise-launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC today.


Plazas and Promenades, which was announced back in August, brings a new pedestrianisation focus to developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder, giving players the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


Pedestrian Streets can be placed like any other road to create green city centres largely free of vehicles and pollution. These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.

This latest Marvel character to join Fortnite is one of four new skins teased today via a series of promotional images - each of which simply shows a hand reaching out of a puddle of gloop.


Fortnite&#x27;s next season is set to begin this Sunday, 18th September, as its peaceful summer party gets consumed by chrome-coloured goo.

                              <span>Eight years after its initial launch, EA&#x27;s is making its enormously popular life sim The Sims 4 permanently free-to-play, beginning Tuesday, 18th October.


From that point onward, The Sims 4&#x27;s base game (which is currently priced at £17.99/£19.99 USD) will be available to download at no cost across all platforms - that is, PC, Mac, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. There&#x27;s no talk of pricing changes for the game&#x27;s extensive DLC catalogue - which totals 12 Expansion Packs, 12 Game Packs, 18 Stuff Packs, and 15 Kit Packs at present - so it appears to be business as usual on that front for now.


In a post announcing today&#x27;s news, EA said it will &quot;continue to develop and release packs, kits and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future&quot; following The Sims 4 base game&#x27;s transition to free-to-play, with more on its future plans set to be shared in a special developer livestream airing on 18th October at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT.

According to the official Nintendo website, you&#x27;ll play as Alear &quot;who awakens a thousand years after the war [between Elyos and the Fell Dragon] with no memory of their past&quot;. 

Perhaps that&#x27;s the in-game explanation for the odd fashion choices for Alear, then.

                              <span>Ahead of Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s release next week, I sat down with series creator Ron Gilbert, co-writer Dave Grossman and art director Rex Crowle to discuss the series&#x27; surprise revival. It&#x27;s a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool&#x27;s Day announcement a few months ago. 
Speaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert&#x27;s shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series&#x27; iconic distraction of &quot;Look! A three-headed monkey&quot;. Apparently, this move works &quot;every time&quot;.)
In addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.

Kimura plays private investigator Takayuki Yagami, the main character of the Judgment games.

The practice was previously commonplace pre-Covid, and frequently prompted outpourings of excitement at major Nintendo game reveals. 


Well, as we know, yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct had plenty of those - and the assembled group of fans reacted as well as you might expect to word of Pikmin 4, Fire Emblem Engage, and the name for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

This test - and indeed our recent interview with Intel - came about in the wake of our AMD FSR 2.0 vs DLSS vs native rendering analysis, where we devised a gauntlet of image quality scenarios to really put these new technologies through their paces. We suggested to Intel that we&#x27;d love to put XeSS to the test in a similar way and the company answered the challenge, providing us with pre-release builds and a top-of-the-line Arc A770 GPU to test them on.


XeSS is exciting stuff. It&#x27;s what I consider to be a second generation upscaler. First-gen efforts, such as checkerboarding, DLSS 1.0 and …</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, we were all treated to a new trailer announcing the name for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Legend of Zelda sequel. 
Along with finally getting its name revealed - Tears of the Kingdom - we also got some new footage. And where there is new footage, you can be sure that Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and I will not be far behind with our theories about what it all means for the next instalment in the Zelda series.
So, we have teamed up to bring you our thoughts on this new trailer below - and to discuss the little things you  may have missed on a first pass. Without further ado, let&#x27;s get stuck in.

                              <span>343 Industries, the developer behind Xbox&#x27;s blockbuster Halo series, has reportedly lost another high-profile figure.


David Berger, who served as lead developer on Infinite&#x27;s ambitious Slipspace Engine technology, will leave the studio - according to reports by Windows Central and Lords of Gaming.


News of the departure comes just days after 343&#x27;s boss Bonnie Ross announced her own exit from the company after 15 years, to attend to a family medical issue.

                              <span>Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That&#x27;s the word that keeps springing to mind when I try to sum up my time with PlayStation VR2. As a fervent fan of VR for many years now, it&#x27;s safe to say that my first hands-on experience with Sony&#x27;s upcoming headset wowed my VR-loving socks off. This sleek and stylish unit was all I could have wanted for an upgraded PSVR headset and much, much more.
In terms of technological and visual quality, this feels like one of the more memorable generational console leaps. Experiencing the difference in visuals between the PSVR1 and the PSVR2 brought back memories of graduating to the sparkly, sharp, high-definition games of a PS3 after spending years playing games on the PS2 in standard definition.
Even the visuals afforded by my beefy PC VR rig seemed to pale in comparison to some of the wonders I witnessed whilst inside the PSVR2 and you can watch me breathlessly gush over it in the video below. There&#x27;s around 40 minutes of PSVR2 information and impressions in there, including detailed close-ups of the kit, descriptions on how to calibrate the headset for eye-tracking and room-scale VR and beautiful 4K footage of the four game demos I played; Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village, The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy&#x27;s Edge - Enhanced Edition

                              <span>Yakuza fans have it pretty good right now. Like a Dragon 8 and a Kiryu spin-off just got announced, but most importantly of all, Ishin is getting not just a localisation, but a full remake and worldwide release.

For non-Yakuza fans, it looks a bit confusing. Why are we so excited about an eight year old PS3/4 game being playable in English?

To explain, we need to look back on the Yakuza series as a whole.

                              <span>Yet another new Yakuza game was announced during the Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit today. 

Titled as Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, this game will follow the story of former gangster Kiryu Kazuma from the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life up until Like a Dragon 8.

A trailer was released, showing Kiryu being disciplined at a monastery, having seemingly renounced all of his former life, before it&#x27;s revealed that Kiryu is in fact still involved with the Daidoji family from Yakuza 6.

                              <span>This year has given us a fresh bounty of farming sims to harvest.

Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct alone gave us five forthcoming farming sims: Harvestella (which now has a demo), Rune Factory 3 Special, another new Rune Factory, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, and Fae Farm. Plus Japanese Switch Online subscribers are getting N64 game Harvest Moon 64.





That&#x27;s on top of recent additions like Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Island Sanctuary mode, the quirky Ooblets, and the just-released in early access Disney Dreamlight Valley.

A short trailer revealing Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga and and series poster boy Kiryu Kazuma standing in Kamurocho was shown.

This is the first official reveal of Like a Dragon 8, following the brief glimpse seen in July thanks to a video from inside Sega&#x27;s offices.

                              <span>Nintendo still intends to release Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, though is yet to decide when to do so. 


The turn-based strategy game - believed to be complete and ready to launch - was pulled from release schedules earlier this year due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


Fans had hoped to see Advance Wars 1+2 reannounced during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, though the company made no mention of it at all.

                              <span>Deathloop could be on its way to Xbox imminently, one year after its release as a console exclusive on PlayStation 5.


An advert for the game now appears on the Xbox dashboard with the option to pre-order now.


However, selecting the advert takes users to a blank screen as it&#x27;s not yet available on the store itself.

                              <span>Mobile tech company AppLovin has scrapped its plans to buy video game engine Unity, following a failed - and unsolicited - bid last month worth $17.5bn.


AppLovin announced it was backing off in a statement last night (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), saying it had instead decided to remain on &quot;its path as the independent market leader&quot;.


Unity rejected AppLovin&#x27;s bid within a week of it being made, and stated at the time it was &quot;not in the best interests of Unity shareholders&quot;.

                              <span>After six years, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles got an official localisation in 2021. It was well received – Eurogamer gave it a recommended - and went on to sell half a million copies. By all accounts it was a success, and it finally aligned the Ace Attorney franchise&#x27;s releases inside and outside of Japan. Except for one game.
Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is a bizarre quirk in an already bizarre series. The original Investigations game is a spinoff featuring Miles Edgeworth, a fan favourite from the original trilogy. It puts his emotional arc at its centre, ending up much more character-focused than the mainline games. The sequel, released in 2011, follows suit, rehashing some areas but extending the thematic resonance of others. It is also the only one of the 11 Ace Attorney games that has not been officially localised.
Investigations 2 is playable in English thanks to a fan localisation that was released in 2015, four years after the game first came out. It&#x27;s a great localisation, and combined with the quality of the game itself, it&#x27;s very popular among those who have played it. But not many have. Its lack of official release in the West has put it in a strange position. Even as the series keeps growing in popularity and spinoffs like The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles get their deserved success, Investigations 2 remains in the shadows.

We also got word on when we&#x27;d see the programme launch - beginning in &quot;some regions in Asia&quot; from late September onwards. America and Europe will then see Stars arrive &quot;in the weeks that follow&quot;.


Collectibles shown included 3D models of Ape Escape, Sony&#x27;s bizarre ChordMachine boombox, a PlayStation 3, Sony&#x27;s feline mascot Toro, the PocketStation peripheral.

Like a Dragon: Ishin originally released for PS3 and PS4 in Japan (under the name Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!) back in 2014, transplanting the chaotic Yakuza formula to the Late Edo Period for a historical slice of samurai action.


It follows protagonist Sakamoto Ryōma as he returns to his home in Tosa where, after a run-in with a high-ranking samurai, he&#x27;s sentenced to be executed.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s September 2022 State of Play broadcast is over! In case you missed it, here&#x27;s everything Sony announced during its 20 minute show, from Tekken 8 to God of War Ragnarok - including all the trailers.


State of Play kicked off with a trailer for Bandai Namco&#x27;s Tekken 8, captured on PlayStation 5. Tekken veterans Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima knocked lumps out of each other in the rain. Yep, it&#x27;s a new Tekken!


Next up, a game for PSVR2: Star Wars Tales from the Galaxy&#x27;s Edge Enhanced Edition. This one&#x27;s out next year.

                              <span>We had an elusive tease at Evo earlier in the year, but now it is time for the real deal. Opening up Sony&#x27;s State of Play, Tekken 8 was officially announced - no I am not Tekken the piss. 


This new teaser shows Kazuya and Jin Kazama facing off against each other on a suitably atmospheric backdrop wearing inappropriate clothing. The mother in me wants to get them both a jacket. But I digress. 


You can see this new teaser for Tekken 8 below.

                              <span>SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have released Judgment and its sequel Lost Judgment for PC on Steam.
The original Judgment is an action-adventure detective game that takes place in a crime-ridden Tokyo. In it, you play as Takayuki Yagami, a disgraced defense attorney turned detective working his way through Kamurocho’s underground crime network to uncover the truth behind a string of grisly murders.
With gameplay, there are two unique battle styles to take down adversaries, and you&#x27;ll have fun with the Hollywood-worthy combat sequences and cinematic twists and turns.

Announced just ahead of TGS 2022 in a livestream, Like a Dragon 8 will star Kazuma Kiryu and Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s Ichiban Kasuga.
With the game&#x27;s announcement, it seems the Yakuza title has been retired in the west, as the developers are opting to call the series by the same name as its Japanese counterpart.

                              <span>Open world games are good and everything, but sometimes they’re just too much. Whether you’re 100 hours into Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and only about 30% through the game, or chasing around Far Cry 6 clearing all the icons off your map, there’s just something about open world games that’s getting tiresome these days. Maybe it’s the proliferation of them – open world games are pretty much the biggest genre out there, right now – or maybe it’s the dwindling nature of our collective attention span. Either way, we’re finding it harder and harder to care. 

And Square Enix knows that. More specifically, Square Enix’s in-house development studio, Luminous Productions knows that. Coming off the back of Final Fantasy 15 (which, let’s face it, wasn’t really an open world game, now was it?), the studio has been keeping a close ear to the ground when it comes to player sentiment about open world games. And – though you may have only laughed at it because of a poorly-delivered trailer – Forspoken wants to do something a bit different with the open world genre to keep you more invested.
“Obviously, from our side, we&#x27;re keeping an eye on what people are saying about open worlds and what the general feelings are in the industry right now,” says Forspoken co-director Takefumi Terada via Square Enix interpreter. “And so we are aware of the sentiment people feel towards [the genre].”

                              <span>If you’ve paid any amount of attention to fighting game fans, influencers, or players over the past year, you’ll know Project L is the looming presence thundering towards us from the murky future. It’s the elephant in the room in the purest sense, a presence that every new release, every new announcement, and every new development in the genre is measured around.
The folks at Riot Games appear to understand the environment they’re walking into; R&amp;D Projects that end up greenlit and pushed into the forefront. The first ever bit of news we ever saw with Project L revolved around the esteemed and experienced staff that were leading development, a strategy Riot had previously used before with Legends of Runeterra and Valorant, which championed big names in their respective genres. This, as it was obviously intended to do, made every 30+ year old buster with an arcade stick a little hot around the collar. Follow that up with announcements of free-to-play, great netcode, and a 2v2 format, and the pants came off.
But, while Riot may have the crowd with boxed copies of Street Fighter 4 hyped, it is arguably far more important for the long term success of Project L that it wins over the non-fighting game crowd. The League, Valorant, Runeterra and Wild Rift communities not only dwarf the FGC, but are most likely the first group of truly fresh players who’ll pick Riot&#x27;s foray into fighting games up first, too. The big question on my mind regarding Project L right now is simply, &#x27;do League of Legends players actually give a shit?&#x27;

Spotted by reddit user Immediate_Exercise27, the store UI clearly shows a Deathloop pre-order card.
The only thing is, when you click the option, it takes you to a blank store page. Still, this means you can probably expect the game to be available sooner rather than later, as the PlayStation exclusivity period is almost up.

                              <span>Early impressions for the PSVR 2 are out on the internet, thanks to Sony inviting a whole bunch of press and content creators to try out its next big step into the virtual reality battlefield. With goggles on and controllers in hand, several attendees travelled and wrote up their impressions, which we have decided to compile in one place here.
As such, if you’re curious about whether or not the PSVR 2 is making enough progress beyond its previous iteration, you can find a collection of diverse impressions below. Of course, we’ve credited and linked back to each piece, and we highly recommend you jump over and read them all if you’d like to know more!
First up, we have Ian Higton’s excellent write up of their impressions over at Eurogamer. In their extended impressions piece, they cover not only their thoughts on the hardware itself, but also VR titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village, and the enhanced edition of Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge. They kick off their piece with: “Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That&#x27;s the word that keeps springing to mind when I try to sum up my time with PlayStation VR 2. As a fervent fan of VR for many years now, it&#x27;s safe to say that my first hands-on experience with Sony&#x27;s upcoming headset wowed my VR-loving socks off.”

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is pitched as almost a quasi-remake of the first Assassin’s Creed game: it takes place in a similar region, and will modernise much of its gameplay mechanics.
However, Mirage is a different beast, and by focusing on a single city and taking into account all the refinement and iteration that the series has enjoyed since 2007, it may end up playing more like a much younger and frankly criminally underappreciated entry in the series: 2014’s Unity, as I argue in the video above. 
Mirage occurs a couple of decades earlier than the events of Valhalla, and a couple of centuries earlier than the first game, but will essentially bridge the gap between the ancient world trilogy of sprawling RPGs that we’ve been enjoying since Origins, and the action-adventure games of the series’ past: bringing the franchise full circle, and providing a neat stepping stone from the post-Roman world of Eivor, and the Levantine world of Altaïr.

                              <span>What a thrill it’s been to see GoldenEye 007 finally revealed to be making a return on Nintendo Switch and Xbox. Sure, it’s been rumored for a long time, but it was still one of the most electrifying announcements on a day that was, thanks to a Nintendo Direct and State of Play, pretty packed full of ‘em.

It was also an announcement that then gave way to questions and even a twinge of disappointment, as an Xbox version was confirmed – but it just wasn’t what we all thought it would be.

Let’s break it down. GoldenEye is coming to the ‘Nintendo Switch Online’ subscription service as one of many Nintendo 64 titles available on that service. It’s a standard NSO release, which means it’s playable so long as you have the right tier of NSO subscription, and is essentially an emulated N64 game rip, given tweaks and adjustments by Nintendo in order to make it run on Switch, and to handle extra features like online play.

                              <span>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has just gotten itself a brand new season. Titled “A Huntress and a Hag”, the update introduces additional content to the title at zero cost to the play, and without any time gating. You love to see it.
Alongside this season, we’ve got a new trailer showcasing all aspects of the update, as well as some story details for the characters present throughout. Expect to see lots of sneaking, archery, and the Dying Light 2 parkour that you know and love.
As for the exact details of what you can expect, A Huntress and a Hag comes with a new chapter agent, new enemies (including the Hag, a variant of the deadly Banshee), some new melee and ranged weapons, and some new bounties. In addition, the agents playable in chapter one are also getting some new weapons and blueprints, so it’s worth popping back and checking out their new gear too!

                              <span>Do you remember back in 2015 when Shigeru Miyamoto said Pikmin 4 was close to completion? Me neither… but Pikmin fans do. Two years later at E3, Miyamoto was much quieter about where the game stood, while still advising that it was progressing.
Regardless, Pikmin fans won’t need to wait too much longer, we’d hope. During yesterday’s Nintendo Direct, Miyamoto made yet another appearance to finally show off a glimpse of Pikmin 4. There’s still no word on a release date, but we do know to expect the title during 2023.
In the teaser trailer shown off during the presentation, we saw plenty of colourful Pikmin and the Bulborb enemy make their return. The trailer also showed that players would be able to play from an all-new angle, one that’s situated closer to floor level and lets us look at the world of Pikmin from their eye-level.

The main benefit of this is, of course, allowing cross-platform chat with Discord users on PC and mobile, but the implementation is not as seamless as you might imagine.
The whole setup hinges on having the Discord mobile app. First, you&#x27;ll need to link your Discord account to your Xbox account. This is necessary, even if you previously linked the two, as there are new permissions you&#x27;ll need to give.

                              <span>The end is nigh. The search for Tyr draws to a close. Kratos is being made to confront the sins of his past, the blood on his hands. And Atreus is forced to watch. God of War Ragnarok arrives in November, and ahead of the game&#x27;s eagerly-anticipated release date, Sony have shown off perhaps the game&#x27;s most revealing trailer yet.
The trailer, which was debuted during tonight&#x27;s State of Play stream, included looks at both pre-rendered scenes as well as in-engine gameplay, giving us a delectible taste of the sort of experience we&#x27;ll have with the Norse father/son combo later this year. 
Check it out below.

                              <span>Great news for you character-action fans watching the Sony State of Play tonight, as Stellar Blade (formerly Project Eve) was just shown off via a rad new gameplay and story trailer. The game got much more than just a proper name though, as we now know the title will be coming exclusively to the PS5 in 2023.
The new trailer can be found embedded below, which showcases a lot of excellent high fying, combo-centric melee action like we got only a glimpse off last year in the initial reveal trailer for Project Eve. Now, it looks like that action has only be turned up to 11 in the time away from the spotlight, with sci-fi fighting that has us foaming at the mouth.
In the trailer, we&#x27;re introduced to a variety of new friendly characters that come alongside us in a journey across a ruined and largely abbandoned world. It seems like a gigantic disaster botched the place up something serious, leading to a variety of nasty (and frankly, brilliant looking) enemies all over the gaff.

                              <span>Like a Dragon: Ishin has just been announced at tonight&#x27;s Sony State of Play! A remake of a Yakuza spin-off title previously not available in western markets, the shiny new action game will be available on both PS4 and PS5 in February 2023.
The trailer shows a Yakuza-like ancient Japan filled with very familiar looking characters, clashing with that classic Yakuza comabt albeit with swords and flintlock pistols rather than fists, traffic cones and stray bicycle. In terms of story, it&#x27;s a classic affair for those familiar with the franchise. Our stern-faced protagonist gets caught up in some devious plot, requirng him to go out and fight-off goons across the land.
The original game — Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin! — was originally released in 2014 on PS3 and PS4. The Yakuza has recieved these every now and again and they&#x27;ve always looked like rad and entertaining twists on the franchise. Who can forget the zombie title Yakuza: Dead Souls, which put us in conrol as Majima as he took on hordes of undead with gusto.

                              <span>Are you ready for the next battle? Today during the PlayStation State of Play, Bandai Namco showed off the next entry in the esteemed Tekken series: Tekken 8.
The game was first teased back at EVO 2022 in a &#x27;blink and you&#x27;ll miss it&#x27; teaser. Back then, we weren&#x27;t sure hhether this will be the next canon game in the series, or another spin-off like Tekken Tag Tournament 3 – we have our answer now, though!
In the trailer above, you can see long-term bad guy and all-round terrible father, Kazuya, battle it out with his son and devil-laced master of karate, Jin. Though the footage seems dolled up for trailer, this very much looks like it&#x27;s in-engine – all the good stuff is there; terrain deformation, hit effects, nice 3D camera panning. If the game looks this good in action, we&#x27;re in for a real, proper treat.

You’ll be able to grab it on Steam, Origin or the EA app. There had been rumours circulating online earlier today that an announcement was incoming from EA on this, and those were evidently legit.

The game’s part of a “transmedia sci-fi franchise” being worked on by very bluntly named devs Game Studio, according to publishers Bandai Namco. The game’s out in 2023, though. Suit up and boot up by watching the trailer below.

Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

                              <span>Longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back in force, starring in two freshly announced games. I’ve already reported on Like A Dragon 8, which stars Kiryu and new series main character Ichiban Kasuga, but devs Ryu Go Gotoku Studio also revealed that another game is coming in 2023. It&#x27;ll explain what happened to Kiryu in his temporary absence from the series and is called, and I’m not making this up, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. To prove it to you, you can watch the trailer below.

It shows off the weird, wonderful and complex ways you can look for love in all the wrong places in Fallen London. Although, as you can see in the trailer, you can also look for friendship, attraction, romance, or a combination of the latter two. Plus: mystery! Who isn&#x27;t intrigued by a romance game where someone utters the immortal phrase, &quot;There&#x27;s been a murder&quot;?

                              <span>Following a similar move by Activision Blizzard last year, EA has unveiled EA AntiCheat (EAAC), a new internally developed kernel-level anti-cheat system that&#x27;ll initially be rolling out with the launch of FIFA 23 on PC this autumn.


Announcing EAAC - which is officially described as a &quot;kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution&quot; - in a new blog post, the publisher explained, &quot;PC cheat developers have increasingly moved into the kernel, so we need to have kernel-mode protections to ensure fair play and tackle PC cheat developers on an even playing field.&quot;


EAAC&#x27;s arrival will coincide with the release of FIFA 23, which brings cross-play across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation to the series for the first time. &quot;In addition to EAAC protecting our PC players from cheaters,&quot; EA notes, &quot;our console players who match with PC opponents will also be protected from cheaters operating on PC platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt update, which lets players leave the boundaries of Appalachia for the first time, is out today on Xbox and PC.


Announced back in June 2021, The Pitt - which is inspired by the Fallout 3 add-on of the same name - takes players to a city built on the remains of post-nuclear Pittsburgh, which can explore by embarking on Expeditions, a brand-new feature introduced in today&#x27;s update.


Expeditions are essentially repeatable missions for up to four players that feature new NPCs and new foes to battle, with participants able to earn various in-game rewards for their endeavours. Bethesda says anyone can take part in these new activities but recommends that players be level 50+ &quot;for the best experience&quot;.

                              <span>Following a period of Xbox Insider testing announced earlier this year, Microsoft has officially launched Discord voice chat support for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S users.


As of today, anyone on either console will be able to connect directly to Discord Voice chats in order to talk with their friends, wherever they may be. The actual process required to do so, though, is a little convoluted, and first demands that users link their Xbox account to their Discord account - a process that&#x27;ll need to be redone if done previously, so new permissions needed for voice chat on Xbox can be confirmed.


With that step complete, you&#x27;ll next need to make sure you have the Xbox mobile app installed on your phone, and that you console is linked to the app. That done, fire up Discord on either your mobile device or desktop and join the Voice call you want to transfer to Xbox. From here, select the transfer call option, which will automatically open the Xbox mobile app.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct did not disappoint, with a brand new look at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel, the newly-titled Tears of the Kingdom, plus surprise announcements for Pikmin 4, GoldenEye 007 and a new Fire Emblem game. 
Nintendo finally confirmed Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s name and a release date: 12th May 2023 - plus new details on what to expect from Link&#x27;s next adventure, which will apparently take him &quot;to the vast lands of Hyrule... up into the skies and [into] an expanded world that goes beyond that.&quot;
Originally confirmed to Eurogamer by Shigeru Miyamoto in 2015, Nintendo finally gave us an official first teaser for Pikmin 4. I can&#x27;t quite believe it&#x27;s still in development, but it is, and it is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2023.

                              <span>A new gameplay trailer for Bayonetta 3 shows off plenty of the titular witch in action, as well as new character Viola.


As revealed in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta will be up against man-made bioweapons called Homunculi. She&#x27;ll be joined by series favourites Luka, Jeanne, and new ally Viola.


Perhaps the biggest addition (literally) to combat this time are the infernal demons.

                              <span>Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved construction and management sim Factorio will be making its way to Switch on 28th October.


Factorio, which has garnered a seemingly endless procession of rave reviews since entering Steam early access all the way back in 2016 (it got its full release in 2020), casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation.


Ultimately, the goal is to build a rocket ship and escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on - a process that begins by farming natural resources to create basic machines which, in turn, open up more and more construction possibilities the further you travel along the tech tree. Eventually, with the planet&#x27;s hostile local wildlife dead and conveyor belts stretching as far as the eye can see, freedom should, hopefully, be yours.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct revealed a lot of surprises - including, of course, the long overdue re-reveal of Pikmin 4 seven whole years after Miyamoto first told us about it - but one of the biggest shocks didn&#x27;t even get a place in the western broadcast. It turns out that Clap Hanz just quietly released its latest golf game on the eShop, rebranded as Easy Come, Easy Golf. 


It&#x27;s effectively a re-release of Clap Hanz Golf, which we first saw on Apple Arcade last April, and which was the developer&#x27;s first non-PlayStation foray. On PlayStation, Clap Hanz was behind the brilliant Everybody&#x27;s Golf series, games we&#x27;ve been championing on Eurogamer for some time. Clap Hanz Golf was essentially more Everybody&#x27;s Golf on a different platform - so to see it reborn on the Switch where it can be played with traditional controls is a very welcome thing indeed. 


You can find Easy Come Easy Golf on the Switch right now, where it currently costs £17.59.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming fantasy farming game Harvestella is getting a Switch eShop demo today, ahead of its 4th November release.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - casts players as an amnesiac who wakes up in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


What follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella&#x27;s dungeon-like regions where they&#x27;ll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village - the most recent entry in Capcom&#x27;s acclaimed survival horror series - will be coming to Switch, albeit in cloud streaming form, on 28th October, with a bunch of other Resident Evil games following closely behind.


Village, of course, is the direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Resident Evil 7 and follows that game&#x27;s protagonist, Ethan Winters, as he travels to a mysterious village filled with mutant creatures - and some exceptionally tall ladies - in order to find his kidnapped daughter.


There&#x27;s a demo version out today on Switch&#x27;s eShop, and Capcom says it&#x27;ll also be releasing Village&#x27;s previously announced Winters&#x27; Expansion - promising the likes of new story content and a new third-person mode - for Switch on 2nd December.

                              <span>Announced during the latest Nintendo Direct, Tunic is coming to the Nintendo Switch on September 27th, the same day the little Zelda-inspired fox hits PS4 and PS5.
Tunic was previously only available on Xbox consoles, PC and Mac, and was also a day one Xbox Game Pass title.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with Tunic, it&#x27;s an indie game primarily developed by just one person, Andrew Shouldice, who was inspired by early Zelda games and their detailed manuals, particularly Zelda II - but don&#x27;t let that put you off.

                              <span>Octopath Traveler 2 was announced during this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, and will launch on Switch 24th February 2023. The Square Enix Japan OT2 trailer also notes Steam, PS4 and PS5 releases for the game (thanks, commenter TinyKaiju! Great name, too).
The sequel takes place in a new era and involves eight new characters whose adventures you&#x27;ll get to individually play. The era appears to be more modern and reminds me of a kind of 18th/19th Century. There are huge, ocean-going ships but also trains of a kind, probably steam. And it looks as deliciously dinky and delicate as Octopath Traveler did before it.
Characters will also apparently now have different path actions at day and night, and there&#x27;s specific mention of their stories intertwining in this game.

Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto first confirmed Pikmin 4 to me as part of an interview with Eurogamer back in 2015. It&#x27;s fair to say we&#x27;ve been waiting on this one for a while.


In 2017, I asked Miyamoto about the project again - and heard from the Nintendo legend that it was still progressing. I never gave up hope.

This Switch port, annouced as part of today&#x27;s Direct, will offer local wireless play via a Friends Pass which lends this version of It Takes Two its own edge.


In It Takes Two, players take on the role of unhappily married couple Cody and May. A turn of events leaves the couple trapped inside the bodies of two dolls that were made by their daughter, Rose. The twosome must work together to complete multiple tests presented to them by It Takes Two&#x27;s relationship therapist, Dr. Hakim... The Book of Love.

                              <span>Around these parts there is no higher praise than &quot;double-A&quot;. It may sometimes be a reflection on the budget, but never on the skill and craft and imagination of the developers. A great double-A game is often a quirky affair built around immediate pleasures and often delivered with a twist. 


One of the things I&#x27;ve only realised recently is how double-As like to find a groove to settle in en-masse. For a while this was &quot;third-person shooter with a gimmick&quot;, so you got Fracture and its terrain deformation, or Red Faction with all those walls coming down. Then we had open-worlds, whether you were a Saint or in a UFO, and endless cover shooters, with stuff like - well, there were a lot of cover shooters indeed.


I am pretty sure that in a previous era Steelrising would have been a cover shooter. That sounds mean and I absolutely don&#x27;t intend it that way. What I mean is it&#x27;s a Soulslike today in part at least because Soulslikes are the perfect contemporary style for double-A development. You get a framework that is recognisable and satisfying on which to build out your specific double-A charms. I hadn&#x27;t noticed until I suddenly looked around how many double-As are opting for the souls approach.

An early sample of the device, apparently left behind by accident, was recently discovered by hotel worker Ramiro Cardenas - after he responded to complaints of a pile of rubbish left in a bag in a corridor.


Cardenas, a VR fan, quickly realised what the device actually was - and promptly posted a series of photos and videos on the internet.

The 40-minute Nintendo Direct broadcast begins at 3pm UK time. Note that Nintendo UK will not be broadcasting the stream because of the period of national mourning that&#x27;s ongoing here. But you can watch it via the Nintendo US stream embedded in this piece.
So, let&#x27;s speculate. Ready, steady, go.

                              <span>Square Enix and PlatinumGames are binning off their beleagured live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall. 


Future updates planned for the game have been scrapped, and its servers will go dark on 28th February next year. After that, you will no longer be able to log in and play.


Babylon&#x27;s Fall only launched in March this year, but has struggled to attract players from the get-go. Square Enix confirmed it was pulling the plug this morning, and said it would run a final season of content from November until the game goes dark.

Michał Nowakowski, CD Projekt&#x27;s vice president of business development, confirmed the news during a recent earnings call (thanks IGN).



&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; said Nowakowski. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion.

                              <span>You spend a lot of your time in Roadwarden tracing the footsteps of the previous roadwarden - a man named Asterion sent, like you, into a swampy, forested peninsula to safeguard the paths against beasts and the elements, tend to a handful of villages, and assess the region&#x27;s resources on behalf of a merchant guild back in the big city. Asterion haunts the peninsula much like the protagonist’s identity in Disco Elysium - a game with which Roadwarden has much in common, for all its Robin Hobb-esque historical fantasy backdrop. He exists now as a trail of unkept promises, deliveries not made, conversations unfinished and grand plans that seemingly went nowhere. 


I admit, when I started the game I felt a little contemptuous of him. Roadwarden&#x27;s setting is hardly gigantic – dredged map node by node from the fog of war, it consists of a single road looping a dense, watchful wilderness – and many of the problems you encounter seem trifling. A monk awaits a package of fine quills. A couple of foragers need help lassoing and subduing a massive, flightless bird. A carpenter wants you to shore up a ford. This isn&#x27;t Dragon Age or Skyrim, but a deceptively sleepy choose-your-own adventure with deceptively delicate RPG appendages, its locations consisting of terse yet evocative descriptions and nested dialogue choices, beautiful eight-colour isometric dioramas and a soundtrack of animal sounds and melancholy guitar. 


There are no armies to slay and no ability trees to scale, though you might pick up a new axe and a fancier padded jacket on your voyages. Your first few conversations with soldiers and innkeepers suggest a society of needy bystanders to be systematically won over by fetching herbs and rescuing lost puppies. How hard can it be, I thought. But the more I played, the more setbacks I encountered, and the more I came to identify with my missing predecessor.

Koei Tecmo and its studio Omega Force, which is also behind the Hyrule Warriors games for Nintendo, are working with EA on &quot;the next great hunting game&quot;, EA said in a note to press this morning.


It&#x27;s described as an original intellectual property, and a &quot;truly AAA experience&quot; based in fantasy feudal Japan. More information will be announced later this month, EA added. Concept art is below:

It&#x27;s a late one for those of us in the UK, alas, kicking off at 11pm BST/3pm PT/6pm ET, but it should be decently eventful too, promising around 20 minutes of reveals, updates, and gameplay for a total of 10 games.


What those games are remains a mystery, but Sony does tease &quot;great updates from our amazing Japanese partners, along with a few other surprises from developers all around the world&quot;.

                              <span>New comments by Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot suggest the publisher will be adopting the increasingly industry standard $70 USD price point for its &quot;big AAA&quot; titles in the future.


It&#x27;s a price point that&#x27;s already been adopted by many publishers - including the likes of Sony, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox - on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but Ubisoft, for its part, insisted it had &quot;not made any decision yet&quot; when asked about bumping its prices up during an investor call last year.


However, it seemed like the publisher might finally have made its mind up when, back in July, it announced its upcoming pirate adventure Skull and Bones would cost $70/£70 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S - and now CEO Guillemot has indicated this will be the norm going forward.

                              <span>Adventure platformer Little Orpheus was meant to launch on PC back in March but was delayed at the last minute. At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

                              <span>Square Enix have confirmed that their hitherto Switch-exclusive turn-based tactics RPG Triangle Strategy will be coming to PC on October 13th. The announcement was buried amongst a whole bundle of other JRPG information from today’s Nintendo Direct broadcast. You’ll have to make do with the Switch trailer below for now, I’m afraid, because Squeenix haven’t released a PC one yet.

The surprise announcement during today’s Nintendo Direct showed a little bit of what to expect from the game, which is also coming to PC on the very same day. Check out the first trailer below.

I can’t believe I just typed the term IP.

The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

You already heard GoldenEye 007 is included in the batch, and while it&#x27;s the biggie of the bunch, more games were announced.
Nintendo plans to add  &#x3D;Pilotwings 64, Mario Party, and Mario Party 2 this year.

                              <span>Back on the 3DS, there was a pair of rhythm games that got a wide launch called Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call. They launched in 2012 and 2014, respectively, and anyone you speak to that loves the series – and the 3DS as a platform - will have nothing but good things to say about both games.
After that, an arcade game, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: All-Star Carnival, was released in Japan (and this poor sap even made a point of hunting it down when they were out there for a holiday) but the series ground to a halt. From 2016 onwards, there was nothing. Until now.
Fast forward some six years, and we get a brand new game in the series – and it&#x27;s coming to Nintendo Switch and PS4. Titled Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the game was announced during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct as a Switch title, but marketing materials that arrived after also confirmed that the game will arrive on PS4 (and PS5 via backwards compatibility).

We&#x27;ve added the bold for emphasis, because it&#x27;s very different to what you see on the Nintendo version.
Over on the official 007 press site (yes, it exists), the Nintendo game is confirmed to have online multiplayer. Exclusive online multiplayer.

In the latest look at the game, the video showed our heroine meeting with journalist Luka and another Umbra Witch, Jeanne, who have &quot;overcome their past histories with her.&quot;
Throughout the Bayonetta series, she’s gone from fighting for herself to fighting for others, and now she is fighting for the world. To help her along the way, the new feisty witch-in-training Viola and her feline demon, Cheshire, join in on the action.

                              <span>I&#x27;m very much a horror fanatic, but I&#x27;m simultaneously a cosy gamer through and through. That said, when the Nintendo Direct revealed that not one, not two, but four main instalments in the Resident Evil series would be coming to Nintendo Switch via the Cloud, I jumped for joy.
Kicking things off is Resident Evil Village. The eighth and most recent instalment in the series will arrive on Switch as of October 28, with the Winter&#x27; Expansion DLC accompanying it on December 2.
In addition to being able to get up close and personal with Lady Dimitrescu from your Switch, you&#x27;ll also be able to spend some time with Jack Baker, Tyrant, and Nemesis from the comfort of your bed, sofa, or wherever you choose to play your Switch games. Resident Evil Biohazard, plus the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes, all currently have Cloud versions in development with releases planned for later this year. Looks like a cosy Christmas with Chris Redfield for me!

                              <span>Back in June, we already heard that Tunic – the isometric action game about a small fox on a big adventure – is coming to PlayStation consoles on September 27. Thanks to today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, though, we learned that the game will also come to Nintendo Switch consoles on the same day.
If you&#x27;re a regular on this site, you know how I feel about Tunic by now – I&#x27;ve already popped off about it being an &quot;oblique adventure gem&quot; and &quot;absolutely essential&quot;. I&#x27;m just writing this news piece to put it in fron of you once again, and urge you to play it.
In my Tunic review at the start of the year, I said:

                              <span>I guess you could call it the moment that we&#x27;ve all been waiting for. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel has had a release date announced at long last, as well as an official title revealed. It was the icing on the cake for a Nintendo Direct already packed with announcements, more-than-welcome remakes, and an appearance from Shigeru Miyamoto.
Named The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Link&#x27;s never-ending adventure is set to continue on 12 May 2023 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch.
Given the brief teaser trailer shown during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, as well as what we already know, it’s clear to see that Tears of the Kingdom will oversee Link taking to the skies. Of course, he’s still got unfinished business to tend to across Hyrule, but this latest entry in the Zelda series will see Link soaring up high too.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the Japanese company announced today that Rare is releasing GoldenEye 007 HD on Nintendo Switch and Xbox. The title is a remaster of the cult classic Nintendo 64 title first hit consoles way back in 1997.
There&#x27;s no release date listed just yet, but a tweet from developer Rare confirms that the game will be &#x27;coming soon&#x27;.
It seems from the wording of the Rare tweets that Xbox users will get a version of the game that has been &quot;faithfully recreated for Xbox consoles&quot;. This version – on Xbox, of course – includes achievements, 4K resolution and a smoother framerate and, per the developer, will even let you play in split-screen local multiplayer.

                              <span>For those logging into World of Warcraft Classic right now, there’s a major push for great gear ahead of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion launch. For many, this grind is taking place in PvP, where honor points can be easily farmed and powerful PvP gear can be obtained relatively quick. However, there’s a barrier to this. It’s not bad team mates (although those don’t help), and it’s not a class or a bug. It’s a playstyle - dubbed the “Russian Meta”.
First off, we need to go over how Alterac Valley works for the uninformed. It’s essentially a giant battleground filled with towers, bunkers, and a boss at each faction&#x27;s HQ. Each team has 600 reinforcements (respawns), and the goal is to either wipe out the enemy team’s boss, or whittle down their lives. This might sound like it takes a while, but taking out enemy towers and bunkers reduces enemy reinforcements, and weakens their boss.
As such, a fast and “efficient” method was coined for finishing up games of AV as fast as possible. This “European meta” has both teams essentially pass each other at the centre of the map without fighting at all. Then, both teams quick try to take out a mini-boss, two towers and both bunkers in the enemy HQ before taking down the boss. It’s a rat race, with both teams seeing who can zurg down the PvE elements the fastest.

EA is partnering with Omega Force, the Koei Tecmo studio responsible for the Warriors series - Samurai Warriors, Dynasty Warriors and others. The developer is working on a new AAA IP that&#x27;s set in a fantasy version of feudal Japan. 
EA called the project, &quot;the next great hunting game,&quot; suggesting it&#x27;s a Monster Hunter-style action RPG, though the publisher didn&#x27;t reveal any details. The good news is that more information will be shared later this month, potentially at TGS, given the studios and publishers involved.

The developer announced February 27, 2023 as the last day anyone will be able to play the online action RPG, meaning Babylon&#x27;s Fall will have lasted less than a year since its release in March this year.
&quot;With the desire of delivering an exhilarating online multiplayer action RPG set in an elaborate high fantasy world, we launched the game’s official service on Thursday, March 3, 2022, and have continued to undertake additional development and operations,&quot; said PlatinumGames in an official statement.

Today, September 13 at 3pm PT, 6pm ET, 11pm BST, we&#x27;ll be treated to roughly 20 minutes of reveals, updates on previously announced games, and new gameplay footage.
The show will feature ten games overall - for PS4, PS5 and the upcoming PS VR2. Though the focus is on Japanese games, Sony said we should expect games from all over the world.

                              <span>Now that Ubuntu 22.10 is into its feature freeze and its Linux 5.19 based kernel landed as well as moving to the GCC 12.2 compiler, I&#x27;ve begun testing this forthcoming Ubuntu Linux (non-LTS) release on more systems. For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 &quot;Ice Lake&quot; processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release. However, Ubuntu 22.10 still trails in a distance behind Intel&#x27;s own Clear Linux platform for the most aggressive out-of-the-box performance.</span>

                              <span>Bonnie Ross, the founder and head of Halo developer 343 Industries, has announced her departure from the studio and Microsoft.


Ross, who also serves as Microsoft corporate vice president, has been the head of 343 Industries for 15 years, having established the studio - specifically to take over development of the Halo franchise from Bungie - back in 2007.


Announcing her departure from 343 in a statement shared on Twitter, Ross explained, &quot;While I had hoped to stay with Halo until we released the Winter Update, I am letting you know I will be leaving 343 and attending a family medical issue&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox has revealed a big free quality of life update for prison management sim Prison Architect - aptly known as the Free for Life update - which launches today on Xbox and PC.


Free for Life is, according to Paradox, focussed on implementing the Prison Architect community&#x27;s most requested features so &quot;players can spend more time managing their compound rather than navigating menus&quot;.


To that end, it brings a range of enhancements, including an improved scheduler and prison log - the latter enabling players to more easily check inmates&#x27; activities, as well as &quot;uncover misconducts ahead of time and keep track of who gets released, reformed, or reoffended&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced an array of new Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, and Eurogamer has exclusive details on how Ubisoft&#x27;s flagship franchise will be shaken up by the arrival of its ambitious new Infinity platform, which will redefine the scope and ongoing story of future releases.

Outside of the Animus, this past weekend was also a major moment for Ubisoft itself, as it emerged from a period of relative silence following a bruising few years of scandal, takeover rumours, and further discontent surrounding its NFT plans. If you missed it, I spoke with Ubisoft boss Yves Guillmot about all of that.
Ubisoft Forward seemed aptly named, with a look over the horizon to a brighter future for the company. But questions remain - as Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

                              <span>The third season of Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher show has now wrapped filming.


Geralt himself, Henry Cavill, shared a special message with the cast and crew on the last day.


&quot;What a season this has been! I just wanted to thank you all for your determination and dedication through a tough shoot,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Ubisoft has reassured fans concerned over listings for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage which stated it would include &quot;Real Gambling&quot;, as part of &quot;Adults Only&quot; and &quot;18+&quot; ratings for the title. 


At the time of writing, a US Xbox store listing still warns that Mirage contains &quot;Intense Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Partial Nudity, Real Gambling&quot;, and lists it as having received the rare Adults Only 18+ label from the ESRB, the US&#x27; ratings board.


A UK listing similarly mentions &quot;Real Gambling&quot;, alongside &quot;Extreme Violence&quot;, and lists it with a PEGI 18+ rating.

Season one was called Free For All, and was (obviously) related to the free-to-play soft relaunch Fall Guys had back in June.

Season two is titled Satellite Scramble, and is all about (you guessed it) space!

                              <span>Having skipped a week with our usual, scheduled DF Direct show in favour of The Last of Us and Intel Arc specials, we have plenty of news and discussion to catch up with, starting with the news that a brand new PlayStation 5 revision is en route to our shores now, having already made its debut in Australia. Tech journalist Austin Evans has already imported a unit, dismantled it and got to the bottom of what makes it different - and lighter - than the existing units.
We&#x27;re looking to go hands-on with the unit as soon as it arrives in the UK, but what Evans has discovered is intriguing - a completely redesigned, much smaller, mainboard along with another smaller revision of the heat sink along with other internal changes within the existing PlayStation 5 casing. Annoying from a future-proofing perspective is that the CMOS battery on the board now resides under the cooling assembly, so when this does inevitably run out of juice years down the road, replacing it will be a far from an easy job.
From my perspective, it is the power consumption numbers that are most interesting. Evans talks about a reduced power draw compared to the prior units he&#x27;s tested, but the nature of the observation is inconclusive in that his CFI-1100 power draw number was actually higher than his figure taken from the launch unit, while this one is correspondingly lower. Fundamentally, the silicon did not change between CFI-1000 and CFI-1100, so is this reduced power draw actually down to a chip revision? Or is it simply down to variances in the quality of the silicon - which can change on a per chip basis? Or maybe Sony has moved onto lower power memory modules? Regardless, a power consumption figure in or around 200W is still in the broad ballpark of the launch machine.

This has included small changes within the cinematics to the various interactive props found throughout the game&#x27;s post-apocalyptic setting.


Now, however, one player has shared what seems to be none other than Dunder Mifflin from NBC&#x27;s mockumentary The Office tucked away in Part 1. 


As shown in the clip below, you can see Joel taking shelter from his enemies in a seemingly ordinary office. However, on closer inspection, there is something familiar about its layout.

                              <span>A new 40-minute Nintendo Direct presentation will be broadcast tomorrow, Tuesday 13th September, at 3pm UK time.


We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for an update from Nintendo on the company&#x27;s end of 2022 plans - as well as a sneak peek into 2023. Over the summer, we&#x27;ve heard various updates on new projects in a rather piecemeal fashion. And now the autumn&#x27;s first big launch - Splatoon 3 - has arrived. 


So, what do we expect? Well, the Direct is well-timed to coincide with Tokyo Games Show later this week, where third-party publishers will be in attendance to demo upcoming Switch games. We&#x27;re also hoping to hear more about Nintendo&#x27;s own plans. Rumours abound of an update on Zelda and Metroid.

                              <span>Forgive me, writers, but I could not recite a single lyric from the Metal: Hellsinger soundtrack. I want to say this is nothing personal - I can&#x27;t remember the lyrics to anything, being honest; maybe I&#x27;m just a bad listener - but actually, it is also a bit personal. This is just how metal works, how listening to metal works: a genre, like the classic music it&#x27;s always leant on, where each instrument has as much of a role in its storytelling and expression as a vocalist. To focus on one would be to miss the whole, enveloping gestalt of sound. You have to take it all in at once, to be both furiously dialled-in and totally zoned out, to enter the aural equivalent of a flow state. Or at least, this is what I would say if Mr. Hetfield ever quizzed me on why I can hum all eight-and-a-half minute…</span>

                              <span>Heartfelt, high-concept and the subject of much internet hysteria; there&#x27;s plenty that Forspoken has in common with its predecessor of sorts, with the development team behind Square Enix&#x27;s big-budget action RPG having been assembled from those who&#x27;d worked on Final Fantasy 15 - a game whose tortured development became legendary, but one that emerged hobbled yet highly entertaining. 


I&#x27;ve had a soft spot for Final Fantasy 15 ever since it came out, its abundance of character and sense of adventure atoning for some of its lumpiness, and despite a rough ride in recent weeks following its widely-derided trailer I&#x27;m developing a soft spot for Forspoken too. After spending just over an hour fleet-footing around the fantasy region of Avaolet, there&#x27;s that same free-wheeling sense of adventure that warmed me to Final Fantasy 15, backed up by an abundance of systems that promise some serious depth. 


Those similarities shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising, given that Forspoken is only the second game built upon the Luminous Engine that powered Final Fantasy 15. It shares the same stupendous scale of world to explore, with the same propensity for a beautiful wide-open vista - the area we had to play around with was full of diversions and mobs and sub-bosses to defeat, but perhaps the biggest distraction was the photo mode I kept turning to, capturing our hero Freya dancing across the fantasy landscape with her magic-infused parkour. If your idea of a good RPG is a stunning open space to explore with plenty of distractions along the way - as is mine - then Forspoken looks like it&#x27;ll deliver.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Forspoken has been doing the rounds for a while - the second game built on the Luminous Engine that made its debut with Final Fantasy 15, it was at the forefront of the PlayStation 5&#x27;s reveal when it was known as Project Athia and has had various public showings ahead of its release early next year, but perhaps its most impactful came after a trailer was posted on social media last month and was met with a rough response online, the dialogue becoming the butt of internet jokes.


&quot;It was unexpected to see the reactions to the social media post,&quot; Forspoken&#x27;s creative producer Raio Mitsuo told us after a recent opportunity to go hands-on with the game. &quot;Basically, we used existing footage from previous trailers and put something together as a social media post. And yeah, it went kind of viral in a way - that&#x27;s not the direction that we thought it was going to go! But I have to admit, some of the memes are actually pretty funny, so I got a good laugh out of it. 


&quot;But, you know, for us, it&#x27;s not something that we&#x27;re concerned with. We&#x27;re obviously leaving a lot of information on the table, because we&#x27;re taking dialogue and scenes out of context. Forspoken is a very narrative driven game. It&#x27;s a very story based game. We don&#x27;t want to ruin the experience in our marketing campaign. We&#x27;re being very selective about what to use to generate interest and sometimes without that information about what led up to that moment, or what was the character&#x27;s state of mind, we&#x27;re leaving the audience the full freedom to interpret lines in any way they want. It&#x27;s just one of those challenges that come naturally when trying to find ways to show the game without telling the full story, because we definitely don&#x27;t want to reveal that.&quot;

Well it&#x27;s not actually in a pub so I&#x27;m telling a bit of a fib - it&#x27;s at EGX in the ExCel Centre, on the live stage. All you have to do is turn up and you can use your mobile phone to join in. How fancy is that? No annoying sheets of paper to faff around with, no passing answers to the team next to you who will competitively mark you down. Just you and your friends having a nice sit down and a nice time.
And guess who your quizmaster is going to be? Why, it&#x27;s me! Silly old me.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 has had a hugely successful launch in Japan, with the highest domestic sales for any Switch game in the first three days.


Since launching on Friday, the game has sold 3.45m copies in Japan both physically and digitally.


It proves how popular the game is in Nintendo&#x27;s home market and how important the Splatoon IP is, outselling even Animal Crossing: New Horizons which had the previous best launch in Japan.

                              <span>Halfway through playing Cult of the Lamb I found myself engaged in a neat little dice-battling game. It was a mini-game, I guess, but it was so nicely handled, so rich in strategy and the suggestion of depth, that it felt like it could well have been spun off as a game in its own right. Call it the Gwent Impulse: inside this perfectly good game, here&#x27;s a smaller, also perfectly good game, seemingly included out of sheer generosity.


Since then I have been very lucky with regards to the Gwent Impulse. Is this a trend? I hope so.


When I say very lucky, I mean that I played two games over the weekend and they both turned out to have secondary games tucked within them. The first is Boneraiser Minions, a worryingly compelling auto-battler in the style of Vampire Survivors. You move around an arena summoning mobs who fight a horde of enemies for you. It all gets wilder and wilder as you unlock new mobs, new spells and all that jazz. Eventually the screen is filled with action and you can barely keep track of it. Beautiful!

                              <span>Fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been delayed more times than most games, although it’s finally pencilled in for a January release date. We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

It’s 23°c outside and folks are already thinking about PC gaming deals they might want in the damp, dark, dying days of November. Hey, I’m not knocking it, and I’ll even put together this guide that early Black Friday birds might find useful. I just don’t even think of what I want for dinner later.

                              <span>Japanese publishers Square Enix are taking more steps to implement the controversial blockchain technology in their games. Squenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys&#x27;s plans fits with Squenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

An ESRB 18+ rating that lists &quot;real gambling&quot; appears to be in effect for the upcoming back-to-basics Assassin’s Creed set in 9th century Baghdad. If you missed the first look at Mirage over the weekend then you can watch the cinematic trailer below.

                              <span>Following the reveal of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage over the weekend, fans noticed that the game&#x27;s rating suggests there will be real gambling, but Ubisoft has put out a statement assuring everyone it won&#x27;t.


At the time of writing, the official Xbox page for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage states that the game will be Adults Only 18+, and will include real gambling, which obviously raised some concerned eyebrows. In a statement to Eurogamer, Ubisoft has cleared the air on the situation, and promised there will be &quot;no real gambling or lootboxes,&quot; present in the game. 


&quot;Following the announcement of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage during Ubisoft Forward, some store pages mistakenly displayed the game for preorders with an Adults Only ESRB rating,&quot; a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer. &quot;While Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is still pending rating, Ubisoft wants to reassure players that no real gambling or lootboxes are present in the game.&quot;

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has announced its next game, Marvel World of Heroes, another mobile AR game planned to release in 2023.


There were a number of announcements at D23 this past weekend, which included a tease for Niantic&#x27;s next game, another AR game, this time bringing the Marvel Universe into the player&#x27;s hands. &quot;In Marvel World of Heroes, players can create their own unique Super Hero identity and origin story,&quot; reads the trailer&#x27;s description. Players will need to patrol their neighbourhoods to foil crimes, complete Super Hero missions, and thwart interdimensional threats.&quot;


The description also notes that as players level up, they can unlock equipment and abilities, and will be able to team up with heroes like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America, where they&#x27;ll face off against various villains in order to save the multiverse.

                              <span>Coming off the back of a Gamescom where Xbox mostly focused on well-known titles that’ll be out pretty soon, it looked like we’d be waiting quite a while for a further update on some of Xbox’s bigger and more mystery-shrouded upcoming games. Every now and then we get a little surprise, however – and such was the case with Perfect Dark, where Xbox’s Matt Booty briefly deigned to talk about the hotly-anticipated reboot during a PAX West panel.

Booty, who is the head of the now-sprawling Xbox Game Studios portfolio of development houses and games, talked about how any reboot of the Perfect Dark franchise would have to be handled “very carefully”, noting that properties such as this “don’t always age well.” And, you know, Booty is right. But the next thing he said is curious – and for my money, it’s wrong. 

“What I think is super cool about Perfect Dark, what’s super cool about Joanna Dark, is the super agent fantasy, the spy, the sort of Bourne Identity, James Bond kind of thing there,” Booty explained.

There&#x27;s been a lot of he-said, she-said, they-said this past week, with reports of the supposed Direct airing this week, then getting delayed, then not getting delayed, and now finally it&#x27;s confirmed that it will be streamed on the official Nintendo YouTube channel at 3pm BST/ 4pm CEST/ 10am EST.


The Direct will apparently feature &quot;roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching this winter.&quot; Seeing as winter runs from December to March, don&#x27;t expect everything that is shown off to be coming out in just December.

                              <span>If you’re one of the very online malcontents that’s constantly droning on about difficulty in games, eyes up – this one’s for you. Metal: Hellsinger, when played properly, is a tricky game with a steep learning curve, and it has no qualms about throwing you into the mosh pit and knocking you down until you can barely get back up. Even the first level will embarrass you deeply if you’ve got no sense of timing and rhythm. To succeed in Hell, you need to keep time. 

This is nothing new, of course: BPM: Bullets Per Minute, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Cadence of Hyrule, and Before the Echo have been popularisiing the genre somewhat over the last few years – giving those of us who like to bob our heads and nod in time to indiscriminate video game murder plenty to chew on. But few games do it all as well as Metal: Hellsinger.
Even if you don’t like metal, there’s value here. As a game, there’s a sense of flow you can easily activate listening to the blast beats of 4/4 and pulling off your slick maneuvers, empowering you and making you really feel like an indestructible master of war. Even better, if you keep your multiplier high by doing everything in time with the beat and going off-time, you ‘earn’ the vocal tracks with some high-profile industry names.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is doing incredibly well in Japan, so well in fact it is now the fastest selling game in the country. 


Earlier today (September 12), Nintendo Japan shared that Splatoon 3 has sold more than 3.45 million copies in its first three days of sale, made up of both physical and digital copies. To put things into perspective, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, one of Nintendo&#x27;s best selling games, sold 1.88 million copies in the same time frame. Meaning Splatoon 3 has sold almost double that of New Horizons.


But as industry analyst Daniel Ahmad points out, it isn&#x27;t just the best launch for a Switch game in Japan, it&#x27;s the best launch for any game in Japan. The previous record holder was Pokémon Black and White, which sold more than 2.6 million copies in its first two days on sale, and only selling a touch more than that in its first week. Which still puts Splatoon 3 ahead just by just under a million.

                              <span>Right. We all know Forspoken as the game that’s been perpetually delayed, that’s been laughed at for its dumb trailers, and that’s been sort-of left out to die. That’s a fair comment, right? A cursory look at any of the popular gaming message boards, or at social media, will instantly tell you that Forspoken is no-one’s most anticipated game. It’s a curio, at best. A game people are gleefully watching, expecting it to fail, at worst. 

But what if I told you that, actually, it’s not that bad? That – when you get your hands on it – it actually feels OK to play? Playing as Frey, the young black woman spirited away from New York and dumped in the land of Athia, you are tasked with helping the people of a dying land in order to get back home. It’s Wizard of Oz via all the JRPG tropes you’d expect from the studio that made Final Fantasy 15. 
The core conceit is your use of magic. A sentient cuff has bound itself to you, and acts as your mentor-cum-friend in these strange new worlds. It also chats shit, constantly, but the incessant banter really isn’t as bad as you’ve been led to believe from all the memes and dodgy trailers. In context, it’s actually – whisper it – quite charming. No worse than what you’ve endured in Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands 3, or Tales from the Borderlands, Battleborn, Tiny Tina’s… you get the picture.

                              <span>Forspoken went viral in August. But probably not for the reason the developers and publishers at Square Enix would have wanted. A video was released on the game’s social media account that immediately caught the ire of the internet’s biggest meme-lords. Pastiches riffing on the game’s dialogue ran the gamut – there was God of War, Yakuza, Doom, Devil May Cry, and some people even said it came off like a Joss Whedon joint (ouch).

But, stay with me here, the game isn’t actually that bad in your hands. Really. I had over an hour to preview the title at Square Enix’s offices recently, and whilst the dialogue is a little try-hard, it’s not that bad. It’s one of those things; a trailer cannot accurately convey how a game will play out in your hands – the timing is off, the editing is wrong, there’s no context.

“I&#x27;m so happy you mentioned the word ‘context’ here,” says Forspoken creative producer, Raio Mitsuno, in a follow-up interview after our preview. “That’s been the the key thing for us in terms of how we&#x27;re trying to show fun things about this game without spoiling the story. [The trailers and social media posts] obviously come without the context that&#x27;s necessary to really understand it, and really get a feel for it.”

                              <span>Revealed at The Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, Gargoyles will be privy to a remaster way over 10 years since it first released on the SEGA Genesis.
Gargoyles, which was first released back in 1995, is a video game adaptation of the animated series of the same name. Both the series and the game didn’t reach the same popularity as other Disney classics at the time, like The Lion King and Aladdin, but it’s still a game that awakes a warm feeling of nostalgia for many.
It’s a classic platformer through and through, that honestly looks great as is still, so it’ll be interesting to see just what Empty Clip do with the remaster. As of right now, all we know is to expect updated visuals and controls.

Almost two years after the previous Norwegian Bokmål translation of
the &quot;The Debian Administrator&#x27;s
Handbook&quot; was published, a new edition is finally being prepared.  The
english text is updated, and it is time to start working on the
translations.  Around 37 percent of the strings have been updated, one
way or another, and the translations starting from a complete Debian Buster
edition now need to bring their translation up from 63% to 100%.  The
complete book is licensed using a Creative Commons license, and has
been published in several languages over the years.  The translations
are done by volunteers to bring Linux in their native tongue.  The
last time I checked, it complete text was available in English,
Norwegian Bokmål, German, Indonesian, Brazil Portuguese and Spanish.
In addition, work has been started for Arabic (Morocco), Catalan,
Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish,
Dutch, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Polish,
Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish and Vietnamese.
The translation is conducted on
the
hosted weblate project page.  Prospective translators are
recommeded to subscribe to
the
translators mailing list and should also check out
the instructions for
contributors.
I am one of the Norwegian Bokmål translators of this book, and we
have just started.  Your contribution is most welcome.
