                              <span>Resident Evil Re:Verse was meant to launch in May 2021 and had its first beta in April of that year. The multiplayer mode for owners of Resident Evil Village then slipped and slipped again. It&#x27;s now due for release on October 28th, and during this evening&#x27;s Resident Evil Showcase developers Capcom announced an early access beta for the game that will start on Monday, October 24th.

                              <span>About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.


I was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.

                              <span>^Stay tuned for our big Resi 4 Remake preview video with tonnes of 4K footage.
Resident Evil 4 Remake is real, we&#x27;ve played it, and it&#x27;s looking chainsaw-pumpingly brilliant.


Resident horror expert Kelsey went to Capcom UK&#x27;s offices for a short-but-sweet twenty minute hands on with everyone&#x27;s favourite Resi game (even yours, and if you comment saying otherwise I&#x27;ll just assume you&#x27;re lying) and reported back to the mothership that everything is looking present and correct: the tetris inventory? Check. Typewriters? Check. Overpowering sense of dread? Obvs. Feet planted while aiming? No, but that&#x27;s fine, because it&#x27;s 2022 and nobody has time for that.

                              <span>When you think of saving your game in Resident Evil, what’s the first thing that you think of? I’d imagine that it’s a typewriter, or even an ink ribbon. Maybe even the tapes of voice recorders, if you’re a big fan of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.
I recently got to spend some time with the Resident Evil 4 Remake, and I made certain to pick apart every fine detail I could locate. Not only was I striving to hear Leon Kennedy say, “Bingo?” or to determine that arranging my storage case was truly just as satisfying as the 2005 title, but — and I’m sorry for doubting Capcom — I was also hunting for a typewriter.
Resident Evil 4 wasn’t the first Resident Evil game to use a typewriter as a save point, however, it was the first to use a typewriter that didn’t require ink ribbons. Saving also became unlimited, before eventually being ditched in Resident Evil 5, along with the series’ spirit.

                              <span>When you think of Resident Evil 4, one of the first things to come to mind is probably those chainsaw wielding zombies with burlap potato sacks over their faces. They were pretty scary, especially when you learnt that it only takes one full sweep with that chainsaw to kill Leon Kennedy off.
Recently, I sat down with the Resident Evil 4 Remake. I didn’t get to spend too long with the game, but I did find myself getting up close and personal with the chainsaw man again. Stepping into that Spanish village all over again, watching Los Ganados pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, I knew it was a matter of time before I came face to face with one of the many chainsaw men.
I was right, and in the same way that Leon Kennedy looks even more handsome in this remake, the chainsaw man I met up with is a lot more terrifying.

                              <span>If you’re a fan of Resident Evil 4, it’s very likely that you’re also a fan of the attaché case storage. Finding the most convenient way to shove your items all into one case may not be everyone’s favourite pastime, but reorganising Leon or Ada’s storage was definitely a strangely satisfying time for many.
In fact, the attaché case item storage was such a hit, that someone made their own spin-off game of it. Save Room - Organisation Puzzle quite literally took Resident Evil 4’s attaché case, and even some of the items you’d typically expect to find inside, and made it a game of its own. 
The goal of the game is to fit all the items in your attaché case each level, and if you’ve spent any time at all with Resident Evil 4, this will be almost natural to you. That said, a game solely spent reorganising your inventory isn’t exactly a great one, but it goes to show just how appreciated Resident Evil 4’s attaché case really is.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a hot topic of late about when a classic game is ripe for a remake, but given how Resident Evil 4 seems to have been rolled out for re-release in one shape or another almost annually since it first appeared in 2005 it feels like a special case. There was a waggle-enhanced Wii version, HD versions for the Xbox 360 and PS3, mobile versions for Android and iOS and VR versions for Oculus Quest - by this point, Capcom&#x27;s iconic survival horror feels as ubiquitous as Skyrim. 


When Capcom announced it was giving Resident Evil 4 the same remake treatment it gave RE2 and RE3 recently, eyebrows were understandably raised. What exactly can a remake bring to make it worth playing through again? Going hands-on with a short section of the forthcoming remake showed there&#x27;s a fair amount to make it more than worthwhile, and this remake provides an effective remix of some moments we know inside out, refreshing them enough to make it feel like you&#x27;re playing through this classic for the first time. 


Before we get to that, though, there&#x27;s obviously a fairly hefty visual makeover in effect here. The original Resident Evil 4 has aged admirably and still looks pretty fine today, but it doesn&#x27;t look quite like this. In keeping with other games that have excellently employed Capcom&#x27;s RE Engine, this is a proper looker with moody lighting and an incredible *wetness* to the gore. There are some truly disturbing sights here, from fresh corpses of recently ripped apart rabbits to the enhanced horror of seeing a villager tied to the stake in astounding new detail. Perhaps most importantly, there&#x27;s an extra floppiness to Leon&#x27;s curtains, and an extra fluffiness to the collar of his famous jacket.

                              <span>Capcom has given perhaps the best look yet at its highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake - and shared a little more on its various other Resident Evil projects - in its latest video showcase, with the remake getting both new gameplay footage and a new story trailer.


On the gameplay front, Capcom shared an action-packed couple of minutes of its RE4 remake, starting with a sequence from early in the game that sees protagonist Leon skulking through the woods before stumbling across a seemingly abandoned barn. It&#x27;s a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake&#x27;s various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.


Following its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to &quot;[pay] respect to original game&#x27;s world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title&quot;. This, it say, &quot;will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy&quot;.

                              <span>Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season, Eclipse, is right around the corner, and the usual promotional blitz is has begun ahead of its 1st November arrival - this time bringing a new cinematic trailer giving a first look at recently revealed new hero Catalyst&#x27;s goopy abilities.


Catalyst - an &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer&quot;, and the first trans Legend to join the Apex Legends&#x27; line-up - made her introductions earlier this week in a new animated episode of Stories from the Outlands. Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas&#x27; moon - but developer Respawn&#x27;s latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst&#x27;s Apex Games debut.


There&#x27;s a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15&#x27;s previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking new survival horror from acclaimed studio Santa Ragione - is free on the Epic Games Store next week, alongside Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.


Santa Ragione, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, previously released the celebrated likes of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, but Saturnalia - which is heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - looks to be its most ambitious title yet, trapping players in an ancient village steeped in murky rituals and challenging them to uncover its many secrets.


Although a solo experience, players take control of four different characters as they investigate the village&#x27;s labyrinthine, and decidedly psychedelic, streets. If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling on the public to share its views regarding Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


This is the next in the CMA&#x27;s ongoing investigation into the acquisition, which entered Phase 2 at the start of September when the regulator decided the deal required more in-depth scrutiny.


Last week, as part of Phase 2, the CMA released its Issues Statement, detailing the focus of the inquiry&#x27;s second stage and setting out the potential areas of concern - known as &quot;theories of harm&quot; - it&#x27;s investigating. These relate to the acquisition&#x27;s impact on multi-game subscription services, the future of cloud gaming, and the availability of Activision content on rival platforms.

In each of the world&#x27;s warring kingdoms is a Dominant, an individual blessed with the power to summon dangerous Eikons.


The new trailer, called Ambition, introduces two new Dominants: Dion Lesage, the Dominant of Bahamut, and Barnabas Tharmr, The Dominant of Odin. Check it out below.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re chewing over last night&#x27;s Silent Hill: Transmission broadcast, and Konami&#x27;s big plans to relaunch its survival horror brand.

Silent Hill has lain dormant ever since Konami cancelled Silent Hills and unreleased Hideo Kojima&#x27;s PT demo. The question is, will anything announced last night live up to that? There was plenty on offer - a remake, a new game, several spin-offs and a movie - from an array of developers. Still, it often felt like we were seeing little in the way of concrete details - release dates and actual gameplay footage.

Will Konami&#x27;s sudden onslaught of Silent Hill bring about a fresh start for the series? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

This new Marathon project will take the form of a three-person squad-based extraction shooter, Insider-gaming reports, and is currently in a pre-alpha state. 


Perhaps unsurprisingly, there&#x27;s also suggestion of this new Marathon game being run as a live service, with season rewards and progression worked in. Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.

Even today, the Rocksteady game impresses with a gritty, rain-soaked rendition of Gotham City swarming with criminals. Unfortunately, Gotham Knights fails to hit the same heights from a gameplay perspective, while there are big questions about its technical make-up. Why limit performance to 30 frames per second? Why were the last-gen versions cancelled with little technical ambition here? And after Arkham Knight, how come the game looks visually underwhelming?


The cancellation of the last-gen versions is puzzling because this is a thoroughly last-gen title in terms of its basic visual make-up - expect to see decent-lookin…</span>

Update 2.2 reworks Orbital in a similar manner to how September&#x27;s patch reworked the (appropriately named) Renewal. Here, Battlefield developer DICE says it has &quot;improved gameplay flow&quot; and added more cover and assets, as well as various terrain improvements.


Another big addition to this update is that of persistent servers for Battlefield Portal, so your server will always remain available within the game&#x27;s server browser - even when there are no active players.

In the latest video in his YouTube series, series creator Masahiro Sakurai revealed new details on the conception of the first game in Nintendo&#x27;s hit fighting franchise and showed never before seen footage.


After the release of Kirby Super Star on the SNES, Sakurai began work on two different concepts: one, the fighting game that became Smash, and two a stealth-focused RC robot adventure game in which players hacked security cameras to progress.

                              <span>In light of the Queen&#x27;s passing, the team behind the upcoming Fallout: London mod for Fallout 4 has chosen to remove her &#x27;likeness&#x27;, and that of King Charles&#x27;, from development.
In a new progress video for the mod, project lead Dean Carter stated: &quot;We have always maintained that if [The Queen] was to pass away before the mod was complete, we would change it. As such, here is the official announcement to notify you all that, we are changing it&quot; (thanks, PC Gamer).
Carter did not elaborate on what the Fallout London team was going to change this all to, instead saying fans would have to hold tight and be patient on this front. He was quite adamant, however, the team would not bring  back its ghoulish Royal Family members in the future.

                              <span>With AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 chips firmly on store shelves, it&#x27;s now time for Intel to shoot their shot. Team Blue&#x27;s 13th-gen chips arrive today, and on paper they represent a huge upgrade over 12th-gen despite compatibility with existing Z690 (and new Z790) boards. You get higher clock speeds (up to 5.8GHz!), more efficiency cores, more L3 cache and higher power targets - all of which you&#x27;d charitably expect to contribute to a significant uptick in gaming and content creation performance.  
To discover if these processors live up to the hype, we&#x27;ve been testing the $589 Core i9 13900K and $319 Core i5 13600K in gaming and content creation benchmarks since last week. Our plan going in was simple: to find out exactly how much better these 13th-gen models are than their 12th-gen predecessors, as well as how they measure up to AMD&#x27;s new Ryzen 7000 and popular Ryzen 5000 alternatives - including the excellent Ryzen 7 5800X3D. 
As with our Ryzen 7000 testing, we&#x27;ve opted to check two RAM configurations for each new processor: DDR5-5200, representing &#x27;budget&#x27; DDR5, and DDR5-6000, the AMD-identified sweet spot for price versus performance. We&#x27;ve also done some more in-depth RAM testing on page five, showing the maximum gains you can expect to see from opting for specialist high-speed RAM over more pedestrian models.

                              <span>At 10.02pm last night, alone in the kitchen, I screamed aloud in an empty room.


To be fair, screaming is something I do a lot when Silent Hill is involved. Shocked screams, scared screams, oh-shit-I-panicked-and-now-I&#x27;ve-gone-the-wrong-way screams; I&#x27;ve done them all. Last night was the very first time I think I&#x27;ve ever screamed in abject delight, though.


After a full decade of neglect - and eight years after the eye-watering decision to scorch the earth of Kojima&#x27;s seminal PT - Konami has resurrected the horror franchise. But rather than dip a cautious toe into the sea of public opinion, the Japanese publisher&#x27;s about-face was so abrupt it was dizzying. At 11pm on Tuesday night, Silent Hill was dead and had been for years. 24 hours later, we have a sequel, a remake, a new Hollywood movie, and an interactive streaming series (I&#x27;m not convinced I understand what that last one is yet) in the works.

                              <span>The producer of Cyberpunk Edgerunners (and CD Projekt Red&#x27;s Japan country manager) Satoru Honma has confirmed that the anime is a &quot;standalone work&quot;.


In an interview with Famitsu (reported by PushSquare), Honma stated that a second season was not in the works.



&quot;I personally would like to continue to work with Japanese studios to produce more anime in the future, partly because we have received very good feedback. However, just to be clear, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was planned as a standalone work, so there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;we are actually working on Season 2 in the background&#x27;,&quot; he said.

Scar&#x27;s arrival lets you hang out with the British-voiced baddie and extend Dreamlight&#x27;s overall narrative - which has you trying to puzzle out why its eponymous valley has fallen into ruin.


To get started with Scar, you&#x27;ll just need to head over to the giant skull in the elephant graveyard - which has now opened up to reveal a fresh lair.

This free update will add the long-awaited campaign network co-op mode, as well as the official launch of the game&#x27;s Forge beta (in case you missed it, some have already got their hands on it and have been creating some truly impressive reimaginings of games such as Ocarina of Time and PT within). 


In the campaign&#x27;s upcoming co-op mode, you will be able to have a whirl around Halo Infinite&#x27;s story with up to three other fellow Spartans. This will also be supported with the Mission Replay feature (finally), and 343 has revealed there will now be another 24 achievements to unlock in the game. As a reminder, this is not the local split-screen co-op, which the developer previously announced it had cancelled altogether.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re like me, you live for the moment in a certain type of film where the mysterious figure in the drawing room says something arch, and then presses a concealed switch. At which point there is a rumbling, or perhaps just a dignified electrical hum. And then behold! Behind the mysterious figure, the fire place, or a large oil painting, or a promising section of bookshelving, will revolve or slide away to reveal a concealed door.


I love a concealed door. I absolutely cannot get enough of them. Not just for the theatre of the opening mechanism, the gasp as an unexpected vista is created, but for the kinds of movies and literature that require concealed doors and the people who own them. And testify: this is one of the ways that Gotham Knights has made me pretty happy. For all its sins, for its shortcomings, low frame rates on consoles, bland open-world stuff and predictable plotting, for all of that, during the middle act it is absolutely the high water mark for concealed doors in video games. Nobody else can touch it. Barely a scene goes by in which a hidden switch is not discovered or a series of piano keys pressed, to send an oil painting through the floor or a see a section of Spanish tile transforming itself into a staircase leading down into the earth.


What is all this sweet work worth? Gotham Knights has disappointed a lot of people prior to its release by being a Batman game without Batman in it. Batman&#x27;s dead, baby! He doesn&#x27;t make it through the opening cut-scene. What&#x27;s the fun of a Batman game without Batman, in which you get to pick between the remaining elements of the Bat-family for your kicks? The fun, I had hoped, lay with the fact that if Gotham Knights can&#x27;t be a Batman story, it can at least be a Court of Owls story.

                              <span>&quot;At the beginning it was a little bit complicated, I&#x27;m not gonna lie,&quot; Patrick Klaus, general manager of Motive Studio tells me. We&#x27;re talking via Zoom following another public briefing from his team on its upcoming Dead Space remake, Motive&#x27;s eagerly-anticipated revival of the space-set survival horror series which is due out on 27th January. But the purpose of our chat is far broader than Dead Space - taking in Motive&#x27;s past and looking to its future, where a massive new Iron Man - the studio&#x27;s most ambitious project yet by far - now sits on the horizon.


Until recently, Motive feels like it has flown under the radar. Founded in 2015 as EA&#x27;s new Montreal home for former Assassin&#x27;s Creed co-creator Jade Raymond, it took five years for the studio to ship its first game: the generally well-regarded Star Wars Squadrons. By this point, Raymond had already been gone two years - poached by Google to work on the ill-fated Stadia. Meanwhile, an ambitious new IP the studio had been trying to build - shown publicly in 2020 by EA via a brief snippet of concept footage - was still struggling to find direction. 


&quot;My predecessor had left and it was still a young studio that hadn&#x27;t shipped,&quot; Klaus says of Motive, when he joined to replace Raymond in 2019. &quot;Motive had contributed to Battlefront 2&#x27;s campaign but was a really young studio, and I would say the first couple of years really have been [about us] searching for our identity and our purpose, like some of those other more established studios.&quot; Motive isn&#x27;t yet a household name in the way other EA teams like BioWare or Criterion might be, Klaus agrees - but that, he hopes, will change.

                              <span>House of the Dragon and Dragon Age 2 have something in common, and every time I watch an episode of Targaryen Family Dinners I am reminded of it. It&#x27;s nothing to do with dragons, nor is it anything to do with inbreeding, because that would be weird. But it has everything to do with time.


One of the most interesting ideas in Dragon Age 2, which was fairly criticised at the time (2011) for being rushed out and cutting corners, was that the game would take place across a number of years. It wasn&#x27;t many: it jumped one year, then three years, then another three years, each leap happening at the beginning of each major act in the game. It wasn&#x27;t rooted, as others are, in events taking place across days or weeks or months. This meant Dragon Age 2 could show you long-term consequences to your actions, and fast-forward storylines to get you back to the interesting bits.


House of the Dragon does exactly the same thing. So far in the series we&#x27;ve jumped something like 19 years forwards in time. Part of this is out of necessity of course: the Fire and Blood novel it&#x27;s based on is more like a history book than the zoomed-in adventure of A Song of Fire and Ice (which most people know as Game of Thrones). It charts 300 years of Targaryen rule, and only occasionally does it dive into notable rulers and passages of time - House of the Dragon being an example of this.

                              <span>Square Enix have released a new cinematic (with a teeny sliver of gameplay) trailer for Final Fantasy 16 today, and crikey, there&#x27;s a heck of a lot of summons action in there. Technically, the summons are called Eikons in this version of Squeenix&#x27;s long-running JRPG series, and from the looks of the trailer, you&#x27;ll be battling as them directly in big, dramatic battle sequences. A bit like in Final Fantasy X, just with an infinitely higher number of enormous explosions. Let&#x27;s take a look, shall we?

                              <span>It’s that time of week again, as the Epic Games Store rotates its free games and grants us two fresh things to play for nowt. If we don’t own them already, that is. There’s a strong chance that you might have already picked up either or both of this week’s freebies. One is Bethesda’s first instalment of their take on the retro-futuristic post-apocalypse in Fallout 3. There’s also Shiro Games’ ode to classic console RPGs, the Evoland series.

                              <span>As a James who’s always forgetting things, I’m probably the main target audience of the Silent Hill 2 remake – one of yesterday’s many Silent Hill game and film announcements. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.


Highlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.

In an update on the Overwatch forums, Blizzard confirmed that the missing characters should be returning to the game on October 25th, alongside the Junkertown map, which has also recently been disabled due to graphical performance bugs. Their return coincides with the game’s next planned update.

There are chips in this family with many more cores and even higher clock speeds, like the £700 Core i9-13900K, but this is the one most upgrade-seekers will probably look to first: a mid-range champion to take over from the Core i5-12600K.

                              <span>Valve have updated their Steamworks documentation for developers with a commitment to refresh their suggestions for regional pricing more often. This change in frequency is an effort to reflect global and local economic conditions affecting regions. While the company reminds developers that they are free to set their own prices in different regions, Steam provides regional pricing suggestions based on the price of a game in US dollars. Those recommendations should be updated more regularly, Valve said.

The commentator said, &quot;Yep, the belief has all but vanished&quot;, as it panned over a guy who simply wanted to be anywhere but that court. At the time, I&#x27;d already sunk some hours into Gotham Knights and taken a quick break from the action to keep tabs on a tournament and collect my thoughts. But as I turned away from the telly to dive back in for another session, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that if the same commentator had been in the room with me too, they would&#x27;ve repeated themselves. I&#x27;d simply had enough.

                              <span>In every story where a wish is granted - whether by some primary-coloured goon sticking out a lamp, a creepy piece of fairground entertainment, or a piece of cursed bushmeat - there&#x27;s always an ironical sting in the tale. You wish for health and it turns out you can&#x27;t die. You wish for a personal chef, but it turns out he only does offal. You wish everything you touch to turn to gold, then it&#x27;ll turn out there&#x27;s no way to turn it off - or it kicks in just as you go to the toilet, that kind of thing. You should, as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.
I&#x27;m sorry I wished for New Tales From the Borderlands, everyone.

                              <span>As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We&#x27;re all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It&#x27;s very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...

                              <span>Hello folks. Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I&#x27;m not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I&#x27;m sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We&#x27;re still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I&#x27;d imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I&#x27;ll keep you posted as soon as we&#x27;ve got more to share on it.
Things that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year&#x27;s list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won&#x27;t want to miss it.

                              <span>What is Ubuntu Touch? (And what does sunweaver have to do with it?)
With Ubuntu Touch, the UBports Foundation offers a truly unique mobile experience - a viable alternative to Android and iOS. The UBports community provides a free and open-source GNU/Linux-based mobile operating system. One that can be installed and used today.
Currently, there is an intensive effort going on lifting Ubuntu Touch from its current Ubuntu 16.04 base up to an Ubuntu 20.04 base. (And very soon after that to an Ubuntu 22.04 base...).
With the Ubuntu Touch 20.04 base the progress bar is already at (I&#x27;d say) 89%, but we recently got hit by a drawback.
I am currently involved in the Ubuntu Touch core development team at UBports and on medium short notice our current ARM64 server sponsor has announced to decommission our ARM64 build server that currently powers all the ARM64 and armhf CI builds.
Call for Hardware Sponsoring
So, the UBports core development team is currently desperately looking for a sponsor (or a few sponsors) who can provide us with (datacenter-hosted) ARM-based CPU power. It is important, that also 32-bit ARM builds are possible with the hardware provided.
For testing, I recently ordered a HoneyComb LX2 (by SolidRun) as a possible solution (multi-node in the end), but the board arrived in a non-usable state, it seems. So this also didn&#x27;t work out as easy as expected.
As the former provider/sponsor is about to pull the plug, this call for help is kind of urgent. 
Please get in touch if you can help us out or know people who can.
Thanks!!!</span>

                              <span>The third release of the still pretty new qlcal package arrivied at CRAN today.
qlcal is based on the calendaring subset of QuantLib. It is provided (for the R package) as a set of included files, so the package is self-contained and does not depend on an external QuantLib library (which can be demanding to build). qlcal covers over sixty country / market calendars and can compute holiday lists, its complement (i.e. business day lists) and much more.
This release fixes a small bug affecting one function, brings calendar updates from QuantLib 1.27 and 1.28, and applies a little bit of polish to appease clang++-15.
Changes in version 0.0.3 (2022-10-19)
Correct the isBusinessDay() functionality (Fixes #2)


Update Australia and Saudi Arabia calendars from QuantLib 1.27


Update United Kingdom calendar from QuantLib 1.28


Convert one source file to utf-8 to appease clang-15

                              <span>A minor release of RcppQuantuccia arrived on CRAN today. RcppQuantuccia started from the Quantuccia header-only subset / variant of QuantLib which it brings it to R. This project validated the idea of making the calendaring functionality of QuantLib available in a more compact and standalone project – which we now do with qlcal which can be seen as a successor to this.
This release merely updates a source file to proper encoding as clang++-15 would otherwise warn.
The complete list changes for this release follows.
Changes in version 0.1.1 (2022-10-19)
Minor code reorganization splitting off calendars.cpp


Convert the Argentinian calendar sources files as utf-8 to appease clang++-15


Advertise the qlcal package as an alternative



Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report relative to the previous release. More information is on the RcppQuantuccia page. Issues and bugreports should go to the GitHub issue tracker.

                              <span>A brand new Final Fantasy 16 trailer has just been released showing off a bunch of new story details as well as what the deal is with the crystals in this new entry into Square&#x27;s legendary RPG franchise. For those eager to learn more about the world, as well as what the different factions and kingdoms are like, it&#x27;s a must watch.
This trailer comes some time following the State of Play trailer we received back in the summer, the last big update we’ve gotten for the game/ While we got a glimpse of some of the major summons in the game, as well as some breadcrumbs narrative-wise, this trailer unleashes a torrent of new details 
We know that the devs have stuck with action combat in an attempt toappeal to a more modern crowd, and from what we’ve seen in trailers that seems to have turned out quite well thanks to some really dynamic looking action as well as a lot of spectacle (as you’d expect from a spectacle fighter), lots of high flying and flashy attacks certain give off an exciting feel to what we’ve seen so far.

                              <span>^Stay tuned after the ads for our big review chat, featuring loads of lovely footage from every version of the game.

Aside from its performance issues, which are annoying but potentially fixable and hardly a dealbreaker, Gotham Knights’ biggest sin is that it just doesn’t do anything particularly exciting. And for a game which boldly kills the Batman in the first two minutes, that’s pretty astonishing.


It’s not all bad: there are some nice ideas dotted around. Occupying The Belfry between missions gives the game a nice overall pace, allowing you to spend time with the characters in some touching, backstory filling cutscenes (though, note of caution, these bits are laser-targeted at Arrowverse fans, a group of people who would inject mediocrity like heroin were it possible). The investigation gameplay also has a few neat touches, like the micro-examination of people’s workspaces and personal tech.

                              <span>Gotham Knights is finally here, the latest in a nearly two-decades old legacy of third-person action titles that has allowed us to jump into Batman’s spandex attire to solve mysteries, beat up thugs, and face off against a legendary collection of dastardly villains. Now, however, Batman is dead. Gotham Knights instead puts us in control of four bat proteges as they try their best to fit all eight of their feet into Batman’s comically large shoes. 
The background for this attempt? A third-person action game where you, as one of the team, head out into Gotham City to fight crime in typical Batman style. With a cast of characters to assist you and Alfred Pennyworth to provide some much-needed advice, you leap from building to building fighting the good fight. In doing so, you level up, upgrade your gear, and spend ability points on a variety of skill trees. It is 2022, after all. 
To spare you the customary tedious backstory, Gotham Knights is a decent adventure filled with mystery, revelations, and equal parts sneaking around and breaking noses. Bar a near narrative swerve into a devastating car crash in the later hours of the game, the story of moving on from Batman and Bruce Wayne while figuring out what happened to the playboy is told with the appropriate levels of mourning and drama you would expect. The idea that Batman was Batman and none of the remaining heroes will ever be the caped crusader is slowly but surely established as they each resolve their own issues and come together to take up the torch.

                              <span>During yesterday’s Silent Hill Transmission, it’s safe to say that Silent Hill fans were eating good. We saw three different games announced, including a glimpse of one of the best horror games ever made, Silent Hill 2, which is being remade by Bloober Team. As well as this, we’ve also live Silent Hill event Ascension to look forward to, and an all-new film for the series.
One of the three games revealed was Silent Hill F, which looks to be the next mainline entry in the series. The art itself in the short teaser shown has also led some to believe that Silent Hill F may have something to do with the Sakura leaks from a while back. 
Personally, I’m not convinced, but Silent Hill F looks rather fascinating and stylised regardless.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Silent Hill Transmission, we didn&#x27;t just see the Silent Hill 2 Remake, Silent Hill Townfall, and Silent Hill F revealed. We also were privy to the reveal of a new film, Return to Silent Hill, and something a little more unusually packaged... Silent Hill: Ascension.
This is perhaps the most excitement we’ve had since was via PT, the playable teaser for Silent Hills. This was to be Hideo Kojima’s take on the series, and given the demo, people were very much preparing for Silent Hill to scare them senseless again. That said, Silent Hills didn’t see the light of day and PT remains an enigma. 
It&#x27;s been a long few years since we heard from Silent Hill, so it&#x27;s rather nice to see the series attempting to come back with full force, in the form of multiple types of media.

                              <span>Revealed during Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission today, the first we’ve seen of the series since Silent Hills cancellation aside from a range of rumours and leaks, the Silent Hill series is going to be in receipt of another new game, called Silent Hill: Townfall.
Konami has recruited the work of Scottish developer No Code to develop the episodic series’ of Silent Hill games, with Annapurna Interactive as publisher.
No Code is known for Stories Untold and Observation, with Annapurna Interactive being publisher of various hits such as What Remains of Edith Finch, Neon White, and Stray. It seems like a promising pairing.

                              <span>It’s been a long time coming. So long, in fact, that it’s personally quite hard to believe this is real and not just another leak. Revealed during Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission today, a remake of one of the most prolific games in the horror genre — Silent Hill 2 — has been announced.
The remake is currently being developed by Bloober Team, as previous rumours and leaks suggested. The developer is behind horror titles Layers of Fear and The Medium, which are both perfectly average. I guess we can now all be relieved that those leaks can be laid to rest at least.
Masahiro Ito, creature designer for Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, and Silent Hill 3, (also art director on both 2, and 3) is finally back on board, too. With Ito, the creator of Pyramid Head himself on board, this remake already shows some promise. Let&#x27;s now just hope that Bloober Team can pull this out the bag.

                              <span>The Silent Hill reveal livestream is almost here! Announced only a few days ago, Konami has set up a giant, much-hyped up event to showcase the latest details on the next entry into the Silent Hill franchise, which has been sadly absent from the modern gaming space. You can watch it right here, using the embedded stream link below.
The stream is set to take place at 2PM PDT / 10PM BST / 5PM ET / 4PM CT today (October 19), at which point the entire Silent Hill community (a mix of really old people who’ve actually played the good ones and younger folks who just pretend they have to look cool to their gamer friends) will tune in.
Silent Hill is one of those video game franchises with a lot of weight behind them. First hitting the market with the striking Silent Hill back in 1999, the game wouldn’t hit its stride until the legendary Silent Hill 2 dropped only two years later in 2001. This was a bar setter in the world of horror video games, with a narrative that remains in the mind of many unparalleled by the rest of the series, and much of the wider genre ever since.

                              <span>The Valiant, available now on Steam, is a squad-based RTS set in the 13th century in which you take control of a group of Knights Templar on a grand historical action adventure story across medieval Europe and the Middle East. 


It includes PvP and co-op modes alongside its substantial single-player campaign: for this let&#x27;s play we decided to employ the services of a History Expert* in order to lean on their expertise in medieval combat and Templar trivia to see if that knowledge will help our writers Connor and Sherif survive the wave-based Last Man Standing mode, which pits up to three players against an onslaught of troops, cavalry, archers, and elite units. The goal? Defend three precious carts from arson attacks, and survive fifteen waves of brutal assault.

*We did decide to employ the services of a history expert, but couldn&#x27;t find one, so we made a Welsh actor wear a stupid costume instead.

                              <span>To follow up to our rather fruitful article on exactly why Disney Dreamlight Valley is evil, which goes into great depth as to why Scar has more in common with a nazi than he does with Goofy, Gameloft has announced Scar’s arrival in the game.
‘Scar’s Kingdom’ is Disney Dreamlight Valley’s first free major content update and is also joined by the game’s next Star Path season, which is available to Founder’s Pack Owners. The free update itself focuses on the biome of Sunlit Plateau, where sunbirds and bromeliads are aplenty, and will see Disney’s most notorious villain, The Lion King’s Scar, prowling the valley.
“Bringing Scar into the ongoing story of Dreamlight Valley and giving players a chance to embrace their &#x27;bad&#x27; sides, while diving into this unique world filled with brand-new twists should be welcoming to even the most heroic of fans, and we can’t wait for players to hop in,”  says game director, Nicholas Mainville.

Infinity Ward has now answered all of our questions, and offered not one, not two, but four sets of PC specs for different configurations.
The PC version of Modern Warfare 2 looks to have the same level of care put into it as with other Call of Duty games in recent years. In that it will support a wide range of options, including ultra-wide resolutions, and higher framerates. It will launch with a new version of Activision&#x27;s proprietary Ricochet anti-cheat on day one, too.

                              <span>One of the best things about graphics card hardware from Nvidia is the software that accompanies it. In a tight, closely competitive competition between it and AMD, software has always been one of the key differentiators. In the last hardware generation, Nvidia added a new piece of software that I casually dismissed - but as the 3000 series generation drew to a close, I finally tried it - and found myself hooked on it.


I’m talking about Nvidia Reflex, a little bonus software option that uses your fancy high-end graphics hardware and various clever methods to reduce the input lag between your input devices - primarily keyboard and mouse, of course, but this’d also work with controllers - in turn theoretically making you more deadly in-game.


When the 30-series first launched, I dabbled with Reflex but never really paid it too much attention. I was more interested in improved versions of the frame-rate boosting DLSS, and how it’d let me crank up the visual fidelity and real-time lighting in newer games like Cyberpunk 2077. But recently, I returned to Reflex  - and in that return, I realized what an impressive tool it is.

In preparation, Infinity Ward revealed the pre-load times for all platforms, along with everything else you can expect from now until the end of the year, in terms of content and events.
To begin with, the Modern Warfare 2 campaign early access pre-load kicks off today at 10am PT, 1pm ET, 6pm BST. This goes for all platforms, and it&#x27;s also the full game pre-load time on Xbox.

                              <span>It’s been almost a decade of The Sims 4, and most fans are yet to tire of the simulation game. During the Behind the Sims Summit on October 18, the title went free to play across all platforms. Now, The Sims 4 has had its fair share of free weekends or ‘free on Origin’ offers, but this appears to be it for the game.
Developer, Maxis, didn’t leave us with just that, though. They also revealed what’s next for the series and gave fans a brief glimpse at Project Rene; the next step for The Sims’ universe. Project Rene is a few years off yet, so in the meantime, Maxis has appeased the masses by finally making The Sims 4 free to play.
So, how do you go about claiming The Sims 4 now that it’s free? Do you have to install it through Origin? Fortunately for you, there are no requirements like that this time around.

At long last, EA has finally revealed a teaser for the future of The Sims series, dubbed ‘Project Rene’ rather than The Sims 5; that said, this is likely what will become the fifth mainline Sims instalment, but there’s no telling if that’s actually the case just yet. By the looks of things, Project Rene still has a long while to go before it’s finally available to launch.
Developer, Maxis, shared its plans during the Behind the Sims Summit, which detailed what’s next for the series and how the developer plans to find new ways for players to both experiment and express themselves.

                              <span>As part of the Silent Hill: Transmission stream this evening, a new game known simply as Silent Hill f was announced. This marks the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade.


There are still very few details about this particular entry to the Silent Hill franchise. We do know its story is by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), its characters and creatures are designed by Kera and its producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo.
Development duties are being handled by Neobards Entertainment, which has previously worked with Capcom as a support studio on several its Resident Evil games including Re:Verse.

                              <span>Konami finally unveiled everything it has cooking with Silent Hill, including a much-rumoured remake, a new movie and even brand new games in the famous horror series. In case you missed it, here&#x27;s a roundup of everything announced during the Silent Hill showcase, dubbed &#x27;Silent Hill Transmission&#x27;, including all the trailers.


First up, we got a debut trailer for Bloober Team&#x27;s much-rumoured Silent Hill 2 remake, which is set for PC via Steam and PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s listed as a PlayStation console exclusive for 12 months, which suggests it will hit Xbox a year after launch.


Next came the reveal of Silent Hill Townfall, developed by Stories Untold and Observation maker No Code alongside Annapurna Interactive. This one remains something of a mystery. Expect more in the new year.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s big Silent Hill announcement bonanza wasn&#x27;t just about video games. Oh no. 


Alongside an array of Silent Hill game projects to look forward to, you should also be aware of a new Silent Hill film, set to follow the 2006 original that starred Sean Bean. 


Return to Silent Hill is the movie project we&#x27;ve heard whispers of previously from the original film&#x27;s director Christophe Gans. Tonight, Konami assistant producer Rui Naito confirmed this big screen follow-up was very much a thing that was happening - and indeed that it has actually been the &quot;catalyst&quot; for the new wave of Silent Hill games coming to fruition.

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of leaks, Konami has officially revived its long-dormant Silent Hill series with a flurry of activity, starting with remake of horror masterpiece Silent Hill 2, which is being developed by Bloober Team for PC and PS5 as a timed console exclusive.


Bloober Team - the studio behind the likes of The Medium, Layers of Fear, and Observer - has been rumoured to be involved in a Silent Hill revival as far back as June last year, when it announced a partnership with Konami to create a new game. Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.


Now, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake&#x27;s unpopular brother.

                              <span>As part of tonight&#x27;s Silent Hill: Transmission stream, a new project called Silent Hill: Townfall was announced.

Not much has been revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie. &quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asks. &quot;Here to be punished... That&#x27;s good I like it. I think we&#x27;ve done something so awful that we are stuck here in this place being judged by these... people,&quot; he continues. 

The trailer ends with some frames of a man wearing glasses, before cutting to the logo of the game.

So, what do we expect? The rumour mill has certainly been churning, and it seems likely we&#x27;ll see Konami pull back the curtain on a number of Silent Hill projects set to bring back the survival horror franchise in a big way. There&#x27;s been word of a Silent Hill remake alongside all-new titles, and even a new Silent Hill movie.
How many games are we getting? Has Sony snaffled them all under some kind of timed exclusivity? Are they actuall all for mobile? We&#x27;ll find out in just a couple of hours.

                              <span>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was a genuine delight when it launched some five years ago. This Switch-exclusive title combined X-COM style tactical gameplay with beautiful graphics and animation. It was made by Ubisoft, but had all of the polish you&#x27;d expect from a Nintendo first-party title - and arrived just a few months after the Switch debuted.
Now, finally, the sequel is here, promising a substantially expanded scope alongside a reworked, more flexible combat system. Tech-wise, we&#x27;re looking at another outing for Ubisoft&#x27;s Snowdrop game engine, the toolset best-known for powering The Division and its sequel. Gameplay is solid, but it comes at a cost: Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope lacks the same level of visual accomplishment as its predecessor. 


It&#x27;s all about the gameplay enhancements with this one, which are substantial. Sparks of Hope radically reworks the first title&#x27;s combat. Gone are the movement grids, which have been replaced with a fully analogue traversal system. It&#x27;s less contemplative, and feels like a more natural fit for a console controller. Critically, you can move a character as much as you like within certain boundaries without using a turn, which makes lining up abilities less stressful. Other actions, like throwing bombs and executing team jumps, are now fully unmoored from turns as well and require a bit of real-time dexterity to pull off.

The detail comes from Xbox&#x27;s full response to last week&#x27;s filing by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, in which the regulator raised its current concerns regarding Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing $68bn takeover attempt of Activision Blizzard.

Sony&#x27;s existing marketing deal with Call of Duty sees the PlayStation branding used in conjunction with advertising, while players on Sony platforms get early access to in-game content.

The Crysis Remastered Trilogy, if this all seems a little like déjà vu, first released for PlayStation, Switch, and PC last October, but the PC version was limited to the Epic Games Store - despite the remaster of the original Crysis already having been launched on Steam.


Come November, though, Steam players will also have the opportunity to check out Crytek&#x27;s remasters of Crysis 2 and 3, with all three games bundled into one package featuring various tweaks and enhancements for their respective single-player campaigns.

                              <span>Yesterday, I popped over to The Trafford Centre to check out Pokémon: Art Through the Ages.


The event, which was announced last month, is styled as a treasure hunt and requires you to look around The Trafford Centre for pictures and paintings of Pokémon. It features all 151 species from the Kanto Pokédex, with some small activities dotted around to get you exploring.


For anyone who&#x27;s not aware of The Trafford Centre (TTC), it&#x27;s a big shopping and leisure complex in Manchester. As well as shops, there&#x27;s also an Odeon, a Namco Funscape, and even a Sea Life aquarium and Legoland Discovery Centre.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly building an Xbox mobile gaming store in direct competition with Apple and Google.


The news, as reported by The Verge, has emerged due to filings from the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.




Both the popularity of Activision&#x27;s mobile games and the inclusion of King are major factors in Microsoft&#x27;s buyout as it looks to expand the Xbox brand further into mobile gaming.

                              <span>Earlier this week, former Fallout 76 project lead Jeff Gardiner announced that Bethesda designer Eric &quot;Ferret&quot; Baudoin had sadly passed away.


Now, as a touching tribute to the designer&#x27;s work and legacy, many fans have taken to Fallout 76 to express their sorrow at his passing, and to bid him farewell.


Sharing on Twitter using the hashtag &quot;ThanksFerret&quot;, fans have created in-game homages to Baudoin.

The furore around the game&#x27;s voice actresses has been raised once more after new claims surfaced disputing that original Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor was offered just $4k to work on the third game.




The debate has fired up both passion and negativity on all sides: towards Taylor, Platinum Games, and Hale, who was somewhat unwittingly dragged into the fiasco.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers have won the right to form a union.


Their petition to the US National Labor Relations Board has now been accepted, setting the stage for a vote by employees to formalise the process. Ballots will be sent out as soon as next week, Kotaku reported, with a result due on 18th November.


Activision Blizzard had previously argued against this process going ahead, and claimed it should be a decision made by a larger group of employees at the Albany studio rather than its testing team. Ultimately, the NLRB disagreed.

The specs were shared on Twitter last night, just days before the game&#x27;s launch this Friday. 

The game&#x27;s Steam listing has been updated to reflect the specs, alongside the minimum requirements for PC which publisher Warner Bros. previously confirmed earlier in the week.

                              <span>Ahead of its imminent release, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 team has detailed its all-important PC specs.


In addition to these specs, Infinity Ward has also announced those who pre-ordered the game digitally will be able to get their preloads on the go from today (19th October). This will in turn offer up those eight days of early campaign access announced in August, which will go live tomorrow.


Meanwhile, preloading for the full release (which, unlike the early access mentioned above, will include the multiplayer and Special Ops elements) can begin from the 26th October ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch on the 27th/28th, depending on where you are playing.

&quot;And yes, we&#x27;ll have a 60 FPS performance mode,&quot; the tweet added.

                              <span>As Netflix&#x27;s gaming strategy grows ever bolder following its first tentative steps into the market, the streaming service has now revealed it&#x27;s &quot;seriously exploring&quot; its own cloud gaming offering.


That&#x27;s according to Netflix&#x27;s vice president of gaming Mike Verdu, who, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt (thanks TechCrunch), explained the company saw the technology as &quot;a value add&quot; for subscribers. &quot;We&#x27;re not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement. It&#x27;s a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games where wherever you are.&quot;


Addressing the elephant in the room - the dramatic failure of Google&#x27;s game streaming service Stadia, which will cease operations in January, a little over three years after its initial launch - Verdu noted that while Stadia was a &quot;technical success&quot; and was &quot;fun to play games on&quot;, &quot;it had some issues with the business model.&quot;

                              <span>In an endless universe of infinite possibilities, where would you most like to go? If your answer was &#x27;Guildford High Street&#x27;, then, hey, you&#x27;re in luck, as fearless space explorers can now visit west Surrey&#x27;s most glamorous locale in No Man&#x27;s Sky.


Perhaps, first, a quick introduction for those who&#x27;ve yet to experienced the marvels of Guildford High Street for themselves; it&#x27;s the epicentre of a small town situated around 40 miles south-west of London that just so happens to be a thriving hub for the UK&#x27;s game development scene.


Poke around and you&#x27;ll find the likes of Supermassive, Media Molecule, EA, Room developer Fireproof Games, Criterion, Ubisoft - and, of course, No Man&#x27;s Sky developer Hello Games.

Earlier today, Regicide&#x27;s developers announced on Steam that the game had been taken off sale and its servers closed down. In the brief announcement, developers Hammerfall Publishing say only that they &quot;will be venturing into new and exciting projects in the future.&quot;

If it isn’t, it’s not too hard to pretend, and DRG’s another-day-at-the-office wit lends it a likeable levity that’s partly why I’ve played it almost every week for a year and a half.

                              <span>The last time we saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune in A Plague Tale: Innocence, the two homeless orphans were escaping the clutches of the Inquisition, trying desperately to find a cure for the cursed Prima Macula in Hugo’s blood. They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?
Turns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they&#x27;ll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.

                              <span>Konami might have just accidentally leaked the reveal of one of the new Silent Hill games due to be announced later this evening. Earlier this week, the publisher announced there would be a Silent Hill Transmission stream taking place today, October 19th, which would provide &quot;the latest updates&quot; on the series.

Lemme start with a slightly funny picture that tells as much about Pune, my city as anything else does. 
Pune- Leave your attitude behind, we have our own
This and similar tags, puns and whatnot you will find if you are entering Pune from the road highway. You can also find similar similar symbols and Puns all over the city and they are partly sarcasm and ironic and partly the truth. Puneities work from the attitude that they know everything rather than nothing, including yours truly  . What is the basis of that or why is there such kind of confidence I have no clue or idea, it is what it is. Approximately 24 hrs. ago, apparently we had a cloudburst. What I came to know later is that we got 100 mm of rain. Sharing from local news site. Much more interesting was a thread made on …</span>

                              <span>Recently I have been looking at how to control and collect data
from a handful IP cameras using Linux.  I both wanted to change their
settings and to make their imagery available via a free software
service under my control.  Here is a summary of the tools I found.
First I had to identify the cameras and their protocols.  As far as
I could tell, they were using some SOAP looking protocol and their
internal web server seem to only work with Microsoft Internet Explorer
with some proprietary binary plugin, which in these days of course is
a security disaster and also made it impossible for me to use the
camera web interface.  Luckily I discovered that the SOAP looking
protocol is actually following the
ONVIF specification, which seem to be supported by a lot of IP
cameras these days.

                              <span>The RcppSimdJson package was just updated to release 0.1.8 today.
RcppSimdJson wraps the fantastic and genuinely impressive simdjson library by Daniel Lemire and collaborators. Via very clever algorithmic engineering to obtain largely branch-free code, coupled with modern C++ and newer compiler instructions, it results in parsing gigabytes of JSON parsed per second which is quite mindboggling. The best-case performance is ‘faster than CPU speed’ as use of parallel SIMD instructions and careful branch avoidance can lead to less than one cpu cycle per byte parsed; see the video of the talk by Daniel Lemire at QCon.
This release simply changes one statement to not trigger a warning under clang++-14.
The very short NEWS entry for this release follows.
Changes in version 0.1.8 (2022-10-18)
Use the &#x27;||&#x27; operator instead of &#x27;|&#x27; on a set of booleans to appease &#x27;clang-14&#x27;.
Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for this release. For questions, suggestions, or issues please use the issue tracker at the GitHub repo.

                              <span>Release 0.6.30 of the digest package arrived at CRAN earlier today, and was just uploaded to Debian as well.
digest creates hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256, sha-512, crc32, xxhash32, xxhash64, murmur32, spookyhash, and blake3 algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects. It is a mature and widely-used as many tasks may involve caching of objects for which it provides convenient general-purpose hash key generation to quickly identify the various objects.
This release contains two tiny changes on old standard C code to appease the new / upcoming clang-15 release now used by CRAN in their forward-looking checks.
My CRANberries provides the usual summary of changes to the previous version. For questions or comments use the issue tracker off the GitHub repo.

For a start, today sees the day one release of A Plague Tale: Requiem, the followup to everyone&#x27;s favourite Middle Ages ratventure. There are similarly big games to come before the end of the month, however, including Persona 5 Royal.

                              <span>I used to think Ghostbusters was a fantasy about having a cool car and a slidey pole in your house. Now that I&#x27;m an adult I realise it&#x27;s actually a fantasy about having ample free time to hang out with your friends in New York.

That&#x27;s because, during today&#x27;s Sims Summit livestream, Maxis also announced that the next The Sims is in-development. Currently codenamed Project Rene, it&#x27;s a few years away, although we saw some early footage of its creative tools in action.

                              <span>Robot damage hero Bastion has been unplayable in Overwatch 2 for the past week due to some unfortunate shenanigans with his artillery ultimate. It was only meant to be temporary, Blizzard said. Yet this increasingly lengthy absence from the game&#x27;s resulted in some players treating the poor droid as though he&#x27;d passed away rather than becoming glitched out for a little while.

                              <span>My initial instinct when playing Payday 2 was to be sneaky. If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.

                              <span>Collectible card game Marvel Snap has been released into early access on Steam as a free to play download. Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.

                              <span>The PC continues to collect PlayStation mascots like they’re Maccies Monopoly tickets. This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.
You can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.

                              <span>Guildford in the UK isn’t a place that you’d expect to feature in games. It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it&#x27;s because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.

                              <span>I loved Overwatch when it first came out. When the original game was fresh and new, I was experimenting with the characters just like everyone else. I found my niche in support, and got to be a pretty decent player with Mercy and Lúcio (I was particularly proud of the latter, because I flatter myself that he&#x27;s quite difficult to play well). Then, you know, life happened. I didn&#x27;t have as much time to play, and I just kind of stopped playing Overwatch.
I appear to have nodded off or something, because there are now 35 heroes on the roster, and Overwatch 2 is out. What. Who allowed this? I wish to speak to someone in charge. Jeff? Jeff From The Overwatch Team? Are you there? Jeff is still in charge right? Wait, wh-

The shutdown will come into effect from January 19th, 2023, just overshooting the 13th anniversary of the game’s launch on PC. It’ll presumably affect the dystopian parkour game’s online leaderboards, and downloadable Ghosts of other players.

This year the pumpkins are back, and better than ever. Download the Pumpkin Fest for pay-what-you-can on Itch, carve your very own pump with the tools provided, and place it among the efforts of others in a peaceful spooky scene. You can take a walk around and vote for your favourite pumps. But this isn&#x27;t the only pumpkin game to enjoy! I&#x27;ve found a couple of others, too. It&#x27;s the reason for the spooky season.

Good job that Capcom have announced they’re streaming a Resident Evil showcase this Thursday, October 20th, then. They’ve even roped in Resident Evil Village’s Merchant to narrate the trailer for it. Watch below for a quick look at what’s coming up in the showcase stream.

Taylor - who has been replaced by voice actor Jennifer Hale for Bayonetta 3 - made the claim in a series of emotional videos shared on Twitter this weekend, citing Platinum&#x27;s &quot;insulting [pay] offer&quot; as the reason for her absence in the third game.


&quot;I didn&#x27;t want the world, I didn&#x27;t ask for too much,&quot; she said in one video. &quot;I was just asking for a decent, dignified living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral.&quot; Taylor also called for a boycott of Bayonetta 3, suggesting fans instead donated their money to charity.

Project Rene - a name EA says it chose to reflect words like &quot;renewal, renaissance, rebirth&quot; - is described as a &quot;next generation Sims game and creative platform&quot; that will &quot;[reimagine] the Sims you know and love with new ways to play&quot;.


It&#x27;s said to be built on a foundation of &quot;charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories&quot; that will stay true to previous Sims games while also &quot;pushing to evolve how those Sims think and behave, [pushing] tools even further when creating and customising, and [exploring] innovative ways to not only tell stories but to collaborate on those stories or creations with your closest friends across your favourite devices.&quot;

                              <span>With Need for Speed Unbound now officially revealed and hurtling toward its 2nd December release, EA is continuing to rev the hype engines with a brand-new trailer, this one showing off what the publisher is calling its &#x27;risk and reward&#x27; gameplay.


What that actually means in practice isn&#x27;t immediately clear from the trailer&#x27;s rapid cuts and overbearing stylings, but EA sheds more light on the matter in an accompanying press release.


&quot;In Need for Speed Unbound,&quot; it explains, &quot;players have to take risks to get to the top. Choose how and when to put it all on the line, pulling huge drifts on the street, outdriving the cops, or placing side bets with their own earnings against rival racers.&quot;

                              <span>Warner Bros. has announced a new role-playing Mortal Kombat game for mobile. 


Developed by NetherRealm Studios and known as Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, this game will make its debut in 2023 and provide users with their first &quot;mobile-experience cinematic story experience&quot; for the series. 


On its release next year, players will be tasked with building up their team of fighters (of which there will be a &quot;vast roster&quot; of characters to pick from) in a bid to stop a &quot;dark and dangerous threat from wreaking havoc across the realms.&quot; This will all be done via real-time group battles.

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky has had a very strong redemption story. Originally released six years ago to widespread criticism over missing features, overblown promises, and barren content, the game has since expanded massively - delivering a transformed experience. Nowadays, it&#x27;s an acclaimed sandbox title, with a wealth of customisation and base-building potential... which brings us to the new Switch release.
Unlike the original PS4 version, expectations must be properly calibrated here, as developer Hello Games has admitted to cutting two key features - multiplayer and settlements - at least for this initial release. Early footage hasn&#x27;t seemed particularly impressive either, but the prospect of a virtually infinite universe in the palm of your hand might be enough to offset that. So is this a worthy port? Or is No Man&#x27;s Sky just &#x27;too big&#x27; for Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console?

No Man&#x27;s Sky is a fascinating and unique title. Fundamentally, most of what you see is based on procedural generation - the world geometry, weather, flora and fauna, and texturing are largely generated in real-time according to a preset seed code. Some elements do repeat, like patches of textures, or certain objects or body parts, but there&#x27;s a surprising amount of variety here. That technology is used to create a highly open-ended sandbox. The curated content is fairly limited, but players can travel the stars, build massive bases, catalogue new species and planets, or tear apart the deformable voxel-based planetary terrain. No Man&#x27;s Sky isn&#x27;t a hardcore space sim, by any means, but it&#x27;s far more tactile, approachable, and immediately engaging than games like Elite and Eve Online.

Since 2016, the lab has allowed players to design their own controllers with personal colour combinations - body, buttons, triggers, sticks and more.


Until now this has only been available for the standard controllers, but now the service is available for the premium Elite Series 2 that boasts adjustable thumbsticks, triggers, a rubberised grip, 40 hours of rechargeable battery life, and more.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption has left PlayStation&#x27;s streaming service after six years of availability. 


Sony&#x27;s service - now part of the newly-revamped PS Plus Premium, though formerly the separate PlayStation Now subscription - has been home to Red Dead Redemption since 2016.


Its departure means there is now no way to play Rockstar&#x27;s original cowboy epic on PS4 or PS5.

                              <span>Bethesda could be bringing back its most infamous Elder Scrolls NPC in its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Starfield.


In a recent Q&amp;A with director Todd Howard, details were given on the game&#x27;s trait system. Each trait comes with positives and negatives, as well as an accompanying side quest to remove them.



As PCGamesN spotted, one of these traits is called &quot;Hero Worshipped&quot; in which the player has &quot;earned the attention of an annoying &#x27;Adoring Fan&#x27; who will show up randomly and jabber at you incessantly. On the plus side, he&#x27;ll give you gifts...&quot;  See for yourself in the below video at the 3:17 mark.

The usual array of in-game quests will offer a smattering of free cosmetics, but you&#x27;ll need to cough up in the game&#x27;s item shop to buy the Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, plus both Meeseeks and Queen Summer from Rick &amp; Morty.

                              <span>EA has updated its Online Service Shutdown page, detailing several of its titles losing online features in the near future. 


On 9th November, both Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars for Xbox 360 (including its Kane&#x27;s Wrath expansion) will see their online services shut  down. 
Red Alert 3, as I am sure you are all aware, is most famous for Tim Curry&#x27;s exuberant proclamation that he&#x27;s headed to space as it is the one place not corrupted by capitalism. That&#x27;s always a fun clip to replay.

A bug seems to cause the game to crash, with some players on Steam claiming they&#x27;re locked out of the game from the startup screen.


Capcom has stated it&#x27;s now working on a fix.

                              <span>Rare&#x27;s classic Nintendo 64 shooter Perfect Dark has been decompiled, meaning PC ports and mods will now be possible.


Coder Ryan Dwyer is behind this, working on both the launch NTSC version and a later re-release that fixed various bugs (thanks VGC).


We can now expect PC players to have plenty of fun improving the visuals of the game, or simply messing around with Joanna Dark, Elvis the alien and more.

                              <span>&quot;Those who can, do,&quot; motorsport&#x27;s most famous enthusiast Murray Walker used to say of his vocation in typically modest fashion, &quot;those who can&#x27;t, talk about it.&quot; Taking that adage further still, some of us are just happy to read about it, and ever since I fell in love with cars driving in circles fast I&#x27;ve read everything I could lay my hands on on the sport and those who pursue it. In parallel with my love of video games, enabled and enhanced by the words and articles of fellow fans in magazines or even on sites such as this, reading about motorsport and the fascinating stories surrounding it can be just as rewarding as heading to a race track itself. 


Some books are better than others, and there are the staple reads I&#x27;m sure anyone with a passing interest in motorsport will have read already: AJ Baime&#x27;s Go Like Hell, for instance, chronicling the war between Ford and Ferrari that was played out on the likes of Daytona and Le Mans in the 60s, or Michael Cannell&#x27;s The Limit which so vividly paints a human portrait of motorsport&#x27;s most brutal era. 


There are recent masterpieces like Adrian Newey&#x27;s How to Build a Car (something that does the unthinkable and makes Red Bull Racing, self-appointed villains of F1&#x27;s new Drive to Survive reality TV era, actually quite likeable), underlining Newey&#x27;s place in a lineage alongside the likes of Colin Chapman and Enzo Ferrari as one of the sport&#x27;s all-time greats. Or if you want to read about some of those older legends there&#x27;s fare like Brock Yates&#x27; Enzo Ferrari: The Man and Machine, if you want to find out more about Il Commendatore before it gets the Hollywood treatment via Michael Mann next year.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed it&#x27;ll be airing the latest instalment of its occasional Resident Evil showcase series this Thursday, 20th October, with perhaps the most exciting promise being more news on its forthcoming Resident Evil 4 remake.


As detailed on Twitter, the publisher will be broadcasting its latest Resident Evil showcase via Twitch this Thursday, with proceedings set to get underway at 11pm UK time - which, if you&#x27;re watching from the US, equates to 3pm PDT and 6pm EDT.


Capcom hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics, only saying it&#x27;ll be detailing the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition - which arrives on 12th December, bundling together the base game and upcoming Winters Expansion DLC  - as well as its Resident Evil 4 remake, and &quot;more&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been clamouring for a bit more jazz in your Elden Ring soundtrack, Bandai Namco has the answer. It&#x27;s hosting a live concert this December that, for those in the US willing to pay for it, will be streamed online.


Elden Ring: A Night in the Lands Between, as the event will be known, is a collaboration between Bandai Namco, Award-winning musician Kenny Garrett, and Takuya Kuroda. It promises &quot;recognisable melodies from the game&#x27;s soundtrack...performed live in Jazz format – with improvisation&quot; by a group of musicians lead by Garrett on Alto Sax and Kuroda on trumpet.


“While video game soundtracks have seen variations as symphonic music and even Rock n&#x27; Roll, our &#x27;A Night in the Lands Between&#x27; Jazz event is exploring a wonderfully different treatment of the Elden Ring soundtrack,&quot; wrote Bandai Namco&#x27;s senior director of esports and live entertainment Wataru Nakasuji in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement.

I&#x27;m a bit of a fanboy for dragons, so, easy serotonin on that front&quot; said one of our interviewees when asked if theh thought skins helped you win a game. &quot;And then I hyperfixate on the skin, and miss every shot, costing a round or sometimes even the game.&quot;
&quot;ALL DRAGON SKINS ARE BAD. DELETE THEM FROM GAME&quot; said another. A pretty bold start to us trying to answer the &quot;are skins pay-to-win&quot; question for Valorant, then.
Valorant is a tactical shooter that pits five attackers against five defenders, bearing similarities to the likes of Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Rainbow Six Siege. As each team tries to either lock down a site or to retake it, players must use a combination of skill, communication, and their characters abilities to secure a win. Whether the power of friendship is on your side or not, the most important aspect of Valorant, arguably, is strategising with your team.

                              <span>A lot of the discussion around Dreamlight Valley – Disney’s astonishingly flagrant Stardew Valley rip-off – has been around how it holds up mechanically against its cosy farming peers. It’s certainly worth talking about things such as crop diversity, villager interaction, and hoe-feel in a game like this... but nobody seems to be addressing Dreamlight’s unique feature. That at any moment, an evil cartoon lion inspired by Adolf Hitler could move into town.
A post about the game’s impending update shows Scar as the star of the show, the next big Disney character being added to the game, posing peacefully next to the Disney Adult player character. Our elderly readers will remember Scar’s behaviour in the 28-year-old film The Lion King as being somewhat less than peaceful, his main hobbies including murdering kings in front of their child’s eyes and performing impassioned musical numbers about race science to his army of goose-stepping hyenas. Somewhere between the regicide and being torn to shreds by his own minions, Dreamlight offers the possibility that maybe Scar took a brief sabbatical by moving to a peaceful rural town and offering a mining bonus and a reward track filled with Lion King-themed furniture to the mayor.  
The experience of playing this game is already deeply bizarre. Dreamlight is trying to tap into the warm, pastoral vibes of Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, but that fantasy is constantly butting up against the complex and messy reality of characters with such disparate morals being treated identically from a mechanical standpoint.

                              <span>2012’s Uncharted: Golden Abyss wasn’t the best Uncharted game. It wasn’t even the best game on Vita at the time, but that didn’t really matter. It was an Uncharted game that looked great, running on a handheld. Those of you who can’t really remember handhelds before the Switch might not understand, but there was something properly magical about seeing games that looked like this on a portable device. The future for the Vita looked exciting... until it wasn’t. RIP, PS Vita – you deserved a lot better. 


Anyway, cut to now, and we have another Uncharted game – two in fact – running on a handheld, and once again I’ve got that magical feeling. A sense that I’m living the future right now. The Steam Deck, Valve’s superb handheld Linux PC, packs quite the punch (especially when you look at how it’s priced not far from a Switch OLED – a machine way, way less powerful). The Legacy of Thieves Collection combines PS4 hits, Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy, and while I’m sure it runs great on a proper desktop PC, I have played it exclusively “on deck” so to speak. I love it. 


I’m no longer a tech wizard, mainly because I just don’t have the time to keep up on all the latest happenings in the GPU space, but I can tell you this. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves looks absolutely smashing on the Steam Deck. I messed around a little with the graphical settings, and by using AMD’s Fidelity FX Super Resolution 2 on “Balanced” I was able to run on the “high” graphical pre-set at a frame rate that mostly hit 35-40 FPS.

                              <span>The line-up of October Game Pass games has just been revealed! Released via an official blog post on the official Xbox website, you can download a variety of exciting (and Halloween appropriate in some cases) games as early as right this minute, including a few really big hitters you’ll want to download while you have the chance.
The first game is A Plague Tale: Requiem, which you can download right now on Game Pass for both PC and Xbox Series X/S. We released our review for this game just yesterday, giving it a very positive review and noting that developers Asobo “should be proud of what it achieved in this game, as depressing and engrossing as it is.”
If you’re looking for something that packs a bit more of a horrific tone — we are in the Halloween season after all — we’ve got both The Amnesia Collection and Amnesia: Rebirth coming to console and PC starting October 20. A legendary series that kicked off the first person horror age that kicked life back into a dwindling genre back in 2010, it’s well worth a playthrough if you’ve not played it yet.

                              <span>On Sunday, Konami did the second to last thing we ever expected of the publisher, and revealed that Silent Hill is making a comeback. The only way it could’ve shocked fans more is by announcing that Metal Gear Solid is actually being remastered.
Anyway, excitement from fans was immediate, as is to be expected. Silent Hill fans are incredibly passionate about the franchise, although many of us are primarily passionate about seeing those original games on modern consoles. Right now, it’s a battle to play Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 on modern devices, and honestly, they might be old and haggard at this point, but they still have something very special about them.
It’s been ten years since we last received a mainline Silent Hill game, Silent Hill: Downpour, and almost two decades since we last received a properly good Silent Hill game (excluding PT, if you’d actually count that as a Silent Hill game, given it never got the chance to really be one). I’m personally a huge Silent Hill fan, although I’m only an advocate for the first three games, excluding a rendezvous I had with Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.

                              <span>It’s safe to say that horror fans are in for a feast this week. Not only did Konami announce a Silent Hill Transmission for Wednesday, 19 October, but Capcom have now also stepped up and revealed that a Resident Evil Showcase will happen the following day, 20 October.
Announced via the Resident Evil Twitter, Capcom has said that the showcase will feature Resident Evil Village Gold Edition and Resident Evil 4. The latter being the game that every Resident Evil fan can’t wait for.
The showcase can be watched on the Resident Evil Twitch channel and will begin at 3pm PDT. So, that’s also 6PM ET / 5PM CT / 11PM BST. Needless to say that I won’t be getting many early nights this week, but it’ll be worth it (I hope).

                              <span>After SUPER PEOPLE’s beta testing phase attracted well over 4 million people, the game is finally heading to release in Early Access, and it&#x27;s bringing in a new character class, some free skins, and a tournament with huge prizes to boot.
South Korean developer Wonder People is celebrating the arrival on what may be the next big battle royale hit with a series of events in Early Access that will give early adopters of the game a suite of special rewards inspired by some of the world&#x27;s biggest streamers. The game has also recieved a graphical update (meaning it&#x27;s now the first  publicly available DLSS 3 game!) leveraging NVIDIA Reflex to deliver some killer graphics.
If you&#x27;ve played the game before now, you&#x27;ll be pleased to note a new class came to the game with the Early Access update: The Demolisher. The Demolisher is a powerful soldier with abilities that include a grenade-firing shoulder launcher and an explosive RC car that can sneak up on enemies.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not been the best of launches for Overwatch 2; whether it was the long queue times, the way people were unable to log into the game, the broken heroes, or the grindy battle pass, Blizzard has been making a lot of news since the game launched earlier this month – and not really for the right reasons.
One of the main sticking points people have had with the game comes down to its implementation of cosmetics; I&#x27;ve already argued there should be a free loot box track on the Battle Pass (similar to the way Apex Legends does it) because I think it&#x27;d make you feel like you&#x27;re actually earning more as you play – even if the rewards are low-value legacy cosmetics.
If you wanted to earn all of that via in-game currency earned from weekly challenges, good luck; you&#x27;d ned to complete every weekly challenge for nearly 450 years. I hope you&#x27;re patient.

So… I am working on new snaps! This release also includes a new content snap I made with frameworks 5.98 and Qt 5.15.6. With all the new goodness,  I am (Re) testing all snaps to make sure they are working as expected.
You can find a link to all of my snap releases from the KDE Snap Store Releases on the menu above.
Some notable releases that have new fixes and improvements are:
Kalzium: Molecular editor now works!
Artikulate: Now works on arm64 ( eg. Rasberry Pi )
Dragon: Now works on arm64
Minuet: Now works on arm64




New 22.08.2 releases re-tested on arm64 and amd64:
Picmi
Kturtle
Ksudoku
Konquest




More coming soon!

really
bugs me. People writing Python code mostly use matplotlib, R people use
ggplot2. MS people use the internal Excel thing. I&#x27;ve seen people use
gtkdatabox for GTK widgets, rrdtool for logging, qcustomplot for qt. And
so on. This is really unhelpful, and it would benefit everybody if there was a
single solid plotting backend with lots of bindings to different languages and
tools.



For my own usage, I&#x27;ve been fighting this quixotic battle, using gnuplot as
the plotting backend for all my use cases. gnuplot is



very mature

stable

fast

powerful

supported on every (with reason) platform

supports lots and lots of output backends




There are some things it can&#x27;t do, but those can be added, and I haven&#x27;t felt it
to be limiting in over 20 years of using it.

                              <span>I first installed Ubuntu when Ubuntu 6.06 LTS “Dapper Drake” was released. I was brand new to Linux. This was Ubuntu’s first LTS release; the very first release of Ubuntu was only a year and a half before. I was impressed by how usable and useful the system was. It soon became my primary home operating system and I wanted to help make it better.
On October 15, 2009, I was helping test the release candidates ISOs for the Ubuntu 9.10 release. Specifically, I tested Edubuntu. Edubuntu has since been discontinued but at the time it was an official Ubuntu flavor preloaded with lots of education apps. One of those education apps was Moodle, an e-learning platform.
When testing Moodle, I found that a default installation would make Moodle impossible to use locally. I figured out how to fix this i…</span>

Details of the new season, which Respawn is calling Eclipse, are a little light at present, but the developer&#x27;s newly launched Season 15 webpage promises a new map - said to be lie &quot;in Boreas&#x27; shadow&quot; - as well as a new gifting feature, enabling players to purchase and send cosmetic items to their friends.


For now, though, the focus is very much on new hero Catalyst, real name Tressa Smith, described as a &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer  [who] uses her remarkable control of ferrofluid to manipulate the battlefield.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be bringing its Switch Sports servers back online tomorrow, 18th October, with players affected by the recent downtime getting an extra week added to their Nintendo Switch Online membership.


Switch Sports&#x27; servers were taking offline and save data backups were suspended on Friday, while Nintendo investigated a significant bug introduced in last week&#x27;s 1.2.1 update that caused crashes on the game&#x27;s pre-match loading screen, during both online and offline play.


Servers and save data backup functionality have remained unavailable since then, but Nintendo Japan has now offered an update on its website (thanks VGC), confirming the crashing was caused by a save writing error under certain conditions and revealing it&#x27;ll be restoring all functionality across two waves later this week.

                              <span>The series A Plague Tale: Requiem keeps reminding me of is Uncharted, and I didn&#x27;t expect that. But not since Uncharted have I been so dazzled by a production, by an adventure, that I&#x27;ve lingered longer in places simply so they don&#x27;t end. And not since an Uncharted game have I been treated to so many spectacular sights in so many spectacular places I have never even imagined before. Requiem, it turns out, is every bit a game about uncovering lost legends and their secrets. It&#x27;s a treasure hunt. Only here, the treasure you&#x27;re hunting for is a cure.


A Plague Tale is a series inextricably tied to the Plague, the Black Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th Century and apparently killed as many 200 million people. It was the plague carried, infamously, by rats. And so it is that A Plague Tale is also a series about rats - wonderfully and gruesomely so.


More specifically, it&#x27;s a series about a young boy called Hugo who has something called the Macula inside of him, a supernatural bond with the rats. And it&#x27;s a bond that people are trying to exploit and control - powerful people in powerful, shady orders - and a bond that will also kill him if you, his teenage sister Amicia, don&#x27;t find that cure.

                              <span>Who is Luigi? The brother. The palette swap. The cringer and creeper, chattering Mario&#x27;s name as he quakes and trembles in various ghost houses. All true. But there is another Luigi. The Luigi of the hard stare in Mario Kart. The Luigi who barges you off the road and wants you to know it was personal. And now: Luigi the sniper. Death from a distance. A cool heart and a steady gaze. Luigi winning the game and bringing us all home.


Luigi was the sniper in the first Mario + Rabbids, a game that dared to ask, what if you gave everybody in the Mushroom Kingdom a bunch of guns? That&#x27;s sort of an awful question, but Ubisoft managed to provide a surprisingly lovely answer for it: you&#x27;d get a knockabout version of XCOM. Mario taking cover. Peach healing. Toad going for overwatch. And Luigi sniping.


This Luigi business didn&#x27;t click for me until I got stuck into the sequel: Sparks of Hope. Then it clicked instantly. Luigi as a sniper! Luigi with an attack that does more damage the further away from his target he gets. Stick Luigi up high and he becomes a god: in action, how like an angel, in apprehension, how like...well, stick him on Overwatch and see. Luigi sniping across the map, wracking up 2000 points of damage. Luigi watching as his enemies shatter into candied star bits. Luigi bringing us all home.

                              <span>PQube and Toge Productions have come to a financial agreement following a disagreement over the use of funds.


Back in August, Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions accused publisher PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge claimed this money was intended to finance its next game A Space For The Unbound.



&quot;The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic,&quot; Toge Productions wrote at the time. &quot;However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                              <img src="https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Direct-82-Site.jpg/BROK/thumbnail/1600x900/format/jpg/quality/80/Direct-82-Site.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been covering PC graphics hardware in earnest for around eight years now and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen a u-turn quite as profound as the RTX 4080 12GB &#x27;unlaunching&#x27; situation. Logistically, the implications are profound: those cards have been manufactured, the packaging is likely waiting. The GPUs themselves may even have RTX 4080 branding that&#x27;ll need to be addressed. Ultimately though, it was the right decision to make - as we discuss in this week&#x27;s DF Direct.


The RTX 4080 12GB&#x27;s pricing only really makes sense if you can ignore the existence of the RTX 3080 and the wealth of availability for the Ampere line-up both in terms of brand-new stock and second-hand bargains. Launching at $699 in 2020, it was based on the same GA102 processor as the much more expensive RTX 3090 - which was only about 15 percent faster. At the most extreme end, a $2000 RTX 3090 Ti arrived much later - and yet it&#x27;s still only about 25 percent faster than the standard 3080. An $899 4080 12GB makes some kind of sense compared to those much more expensive GA102 offerings, but the $699 RTX 3080 follows it like a mocking shadow.


Not helping matters are Nvidia&#x27;s latest round of benchmarks. Three titles are chosen: Flight Simulator, A Plague Tale: Requiem and F1 22. Each game offers up varying performance differentials but the bottom line is that a notional 29 percent increase in cost against the RTX 3080 delivered a minimum 11 percent of extra performance at native 4K resolution (A Plague Tale: Requiem) and a maximum 24 percent in F1 22. DLSS 3 is used to beef up the numbers in favour of the new Ada Lovelace card - but while we&#x27;re excited by the technology, it&#x27;s not the finished article and its use in benchmarks isn&#x27;t a great move, not least because only a few DLSS 3 titles are available. Whichever way you look at the RTX 3080 12GB, the spectre of the RTX 3080 looms too large.

Each item in this collection has been influenced by the game, with elements such as Forbidden West&#x27;s key art and homages to Aloy&#x27;s in-game looks included throughout each piece.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has launched a new kind of raid activity - Elite Raids - designed to test players&#x27; mettle in return for ultra-rare creatures.


Beyond being a test for players with a buffed-up Pokémon team, Elite Raids also seem like Pokémon Go developer Niantic&#x27;s latest nudge to get users back outside in big numbers, generating the kind of crowds you might see playing pre-pandemic.


The first evidence of Elite Raids began popping up in-game on Friday, with an extended 24-hour countdown clock on some Pokémon gyms and a flashy new raid egg on the game&#x27;s map. A message stated these raids would require players to take part in-person at the raid site itself, rather than using a Remote Raid Pass to join from the sofa.

That includes adjusting the volume of various sound effects and adding a &quot;distance to opponent&quot; sound.

The incident occurred at a Gladiators-style foam pit stand sponsored by Lenovo, where Chechik jumped into the pit and was left severely injured. Several others were also injured.


Chechik has been sharing updates on her recovery on social media, confirming she had a second round of surgery on 14th October - almost a week after the incident.

                              <span>This weekend saw Minecraft developer Mojang make numerous announcements as part of its annual Minecraft Live celebration - including the first details of 2023&#x27;s big vanilla Minecraft update.


But in a change to tradition, we didn&#x27;t get a title for the update or its full list of additions - in response to the fact Mojang has  struggled in the past to deliver everything it has previously promised. 


For now, Minecraft&#x27;s 2023 update is being referred to as &quot;Minecraft 1.20&quot;, and is confirmed to feature camels, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves and bamboo crafting - including the ability to build a bamboo raft. Camels look a particularly interesting addition - as they can jump fair distances and fit two players riding on top.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will be limited to 30FPS and not include a performance mode for consoles on its release later this month. 


This news was confirmed by Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was &quot;due to the types of features&quot; included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been &quot;as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS&quot;.


Marty highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;highly detailed&quot; open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not &quot;have a performance/quality toggle option&quot;. She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game).

                              <span>Konami horror project P.T. has been made playable on a PlayStation 5, via a hacked PS4 emulator.


Streamer and dataminer Lance McDonald has managed to get the game working on a non-jailbroken PS5 console.


Essentially, a legitimate copy of P.T. is required as well as an active PSN account on both a jailbroken PS5 and a normal, fully updated PS5. The emulator is then transferred from one to the other.

Taylor, who voiced the character in the first two games, has been succeeded by Jennifer Hale for the third game for unknown reasons, until now.
In a series of emotional videos on Twitter, Taylor explains she was offered just $4000 as a flat rate to work on Bayonetta 3, despite her previous work and years of training.

                              <span>^Stay tuned after the ads for our guide to legging it through a particularly gnarly bit of Requiem&#x27;s second chapter.

Look, we all know that pang of regret that comes on when you cock-up a stealth section and get spotted but finish the level anyway. There&#x27;s always a lingering sense of having not done things Properly. Perhaps, if you&#x27;re the sort of person who likes to get max sync in Assassin&#x27;s Creed no matter what, you&#x27;ll make a mental note to do better on your next playthrough. But A Plague Tale: Requiem encourages you to simply manage,  however one must. 


At the end of chapter two there is a sequence which ostensibly presents itself as a stealth section, complete with reeds to hide in, guards with predictable patrols, and plenty of cover to duck behind. But something happens around half way through which mixes things up in a way that the first game never quite dared: the rats cometh.  Bursting up from the ground, through walls, hugging the edge of the light and filling every dark space. In this section, A Plague Tale&#x27;s &quot;The Floor Is Lava&quot; game collides with its &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; game: and the results are harrowing.

                              <span>During the Dutch revolt from 1566 to 1648, there was a cruel general of the Geuzen named Diederik Sonoy that supposedly employed rats as a method of torture on captured troops. He’d take a starving rat, a pottery bowl, and embers of charcoal from a nearby fire and show them to the accused. The rat – intentionally starved and kept separate from other creatures – would be placed on the naked body of a prisoner. The bowl would be placed over the rat, and the charcoals added on top. The rat would gnaw into the very bowels of the victim, as it tried desperately to escape. More often than not, the rat and the prisoner would die. The rat’s destruction in an attempt at self-preservation was all for nothing. 
That’s what A Plague Tale: Requiem feels like; your protagonist duo, Amicia and Hugo, are the rats. They rip an almost-unbelievable path of destruction through 14th Century France as they run, panicked, from the death and disease that they cannot shake. They wreak havoc on the fragile body of a country torn apart by war, pestilence, famine, and death. Cruelty and inhumanity pushes them forward as the world falls apart behind them, and in trying to be kind they do some of the most horrific damage you’re liable to see in a video game this year. 
A Plague Tale: Requiem is not for the faint-hearted – and not just because of the 300,000 rats the developers can summon on-screen at once. The central story is a grim reflection of a human race that is, inherently, cruel. It’s a story about how even the brightest and most caring of us can be pushed to our limits and become unhinged; violent and disaffected and barbaric. It’s a game that is aware of what it makes you do – how it makes you kill, even if you don’t want to – and pulls on that guilt to make you, and your characters, suffer. In A Plague Tale: Requiem, you are the rat being forced through the body of a France that knows nothing but sorrow, and you will find you just can’t stop eating – no matter how much it hurts you.

                              <span>^ Stay tuned after the ads for our A Plague Tale: Requiem review chat over twenty actual minutes of gorgeous ultrawide gameplay at max settings on PC.


Marshalling all the power of next-gen GPUs to render a swarm of 300,000 rats gnashing its way through medieval France is, in and of itself, a pretty neat party trick. The fact that Asobo Studio use it merely as the basis for an arresting, gripping tale of human ingenuity in the face of unfathomable disaster is an astoundingly impressive feat: and as if that wasn&#x27;t showing off enough, they&#x27;ve now gone and done it twice with A Plague Tale: Requiem, the bold and brilliant sequel to 2019&#x27;s Innocence.


The first game earned itself comparisons to the likes of God of War and The Last of Us back when it came out, and it’s easy to see why: all of these games are, essentially, 20-hour escort quests that play out as a harrowing road trip over a dozen or so chapters. But without Sony’s money hose at hand to piss cash at your telly as though it were a truck stop urinal, there was a sense that Plague Tale couldn’t compete. It even got saddled with a pithy nickname in “The Past of Us”, as many quipped at the preview stage.

                              <span>Respawn has revealed its newest character coming to Apex Legends, Catalyst, in a new animated short showing off her backstory.


Catalyst, also known as Tressa Smith, is an &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer,&quot; who &quot;uses her remarkable control of ferrofluid to manipulate the battlefield,&quot; as described on the game&#x27;s official site. In the short, called Last Hope, it shows her and a friend trying to save one of Boreas&#x27; moons, Cleo, but they disagree with the methodology in doing so.


She seems to have a very witchy vibe, though with a sci-fi twist, some majorly strong vibes overall. Catalyst is also seen chatting with Rampart as the two talk over some crystals that the former is reading, really amping up the witchy feeling, as she explains her backstory.

                              <span>I don’t approve of this phrase, but I’m going to say it anyway: Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is lovely. There, I’ve said it. Feels a bit dirty to describe the game, any game, in such simple terms, but it’s what spins around in my head when I try to sum it up. I’d draw the line at calling it nice, but, thinking about it a bit, it is rather nice, actually. It’s lovely and nice. It’s the kind of game you’d be happy to show your grandma but then smirk when Peach blasts away a foe with a shotgun and granny asks if that bear-like thing is okay. It’s not okay, granny. After Peach unloaded, Rabbid Luigi came along and unleashed a trio of toxic shock waves. Maybe I’ve got the game all wrong. 

Mario + Rabbids essentially showed us what a world of rabbid Mario characters would look and behave lik…</span>

                              <span>Bastion mains are currently suffering some deep, dark sadness as a result of their best boy being removed from Overwatch 2. The character, a lovable robot who could turn into a rocket-spewing killing machine with their ultimate ability, was ripped from the game due to an easy-to-do and super overpowered bug, leaving the Bastion mains in a kind of depressive limbo.
“Should it really take 5+ days to fix an ultimate?” writes r/BastionMains user HyperBastiorean, lashing out at Blizzard for taking so long to fix their favourite hero. Five days isn’t even really that long a stretch, but such is the connection between certain Bastion buds on the internet, striking out at others like Sickboy on his epic heroin comedown in Trainspotting.
Some bravely believe they can live a life without Bastion, in spite of their life leading them to become commenters on the Bastion subreddit. Dodo501 writes: “I already uninstalled, I refuse to play trash without Bastion. Won&#x27;t be reinstalling even if/when he&#x27;s added back.” Indeed, for all the genuine hardship Overwatch 2 players have had to undergo, such as an awful battle pass and phone verification system, it must suck to have your beloved main character removed.

                              <span>In the modern day and age, collectable card games are doing damn well. Titles like Hearthstone, YuGiOh, and Magic the Gathering have all established their own entrenched positions in the video game market, bringing the decades-old  hobby to computers, to consoles, and especially to mobile. Enter Marvel Snap, a new challenger to the big hitters with the word accessibility at its back in gleaming golden letters, and the team at Second Dinner Studios trying to recapture the spirit of an older, youthful card game experience.
To guide me through the game, and the goals the team has for it, is Ben Brode: flannel shirt aficionado, formerly of Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s Hearthstone team and currently chief development officer at Second Dinner Studios. While the studio has obviously got a long list of content courses it&#x27;d like to dish out through seasonal releases and ongoing updates, can it make a dent?
But before we get into the nitty gritty, what is Marvel Snap? Well, it&#x27;s a quickfire card game which has each play fill out three spaces on the board, each with four card slots and their own active modifiers that range from buffs to cards played there to limits on what you can place there. In six turns, both competitors must try and fill up these spaces with cards in their deck,with every card possessing their own power figure and abilities   It&#x27;s the perfect type of game for phones in my mind, super fast and easy to grasp.

                              <span>It looks like Activision is working on a patent to include AI-generated music in its multiplayer games.


AI-generated art has probably been all over your timelines recently, clearly being the next big trend in the world of tech, so it&#x27;s no surprise that this is extending to AI audio and music. And as spotted by Exputer, Activision has recently published a new patent that involves &quot;systems and methods for dynamically generating and modulating music based on gaming events, player profiles and/ or player reactions.&quot;


Let&#x27;s layout what this means roughly: say you&#x27;re in a match of your favourite Activision developed, multiplayer title, like a Call of Duty game for example! You&#x27;re down to your last round, your health isn&#x27;t doing so good, and you&#x27;re surrounded. By the sounds of things, this patent would allow the soundtrack to be custom tailored to these specific set of circumstances, producing a unique piece of music for the player.

The press release notes that under Mason-Boule&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Riot is expanding its approach to global development, and over time, Riot is looking forward to growing the game industry in Australia and will also continue to explore similar opportunities to add expert talent from veteran studios.&quot;

It was the original Fallout&#x27;s 25th anniversary earlier this month, and to celebrate DualShockers spoke with Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart, talking to him about whether the studio would ever come back to the series. &quot;If we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we&#x27;d make it,&quot; Urquhart answered when asked if Obsidian would say yes to work on a new game.


&quot;There&#x27;s not even a question of whether or not we would do it, it&#x27;s just &#x27;Will the opportunity arise?&#x27;&quot; Urquhart continued. &quot;I hung around at Interplay for probably an extra year because I wanted to work on Fallout more. I love Fallout.&quot; Obviously this isn&#x27;t him saying that it will happen, but fans have been hoping it would be at all possible, as Microsoft acquired Obsidian in 2018, and then later acquired Fallout rights holders Bethesda through buying its parent company ZeniMax Media.

                              <span>Just last week, we told you all about how someone managed to jailbreak the PS5, and of course, people began installing PT on their consoles as a result. PT, the demo for the since called Silent Hills game, is a bit of an enigma in 2022.
PT arrived as an obscure demo in 2014. It wasn’t until a short while later that someone figured the enigma out, and realised it was for an upcoming Silent Hill game. Then, Silent Hills was cancelled after a fallout between Konami and Hideo Kojima, leaving PT to be removed from the PlayStation Store and to fade into obscurity.
That said, people have been chasing the PT high ever since. There’s been various PC clones of the demo, many of them great but none of them perfect, and of course, in light of news regarding a jailbreak for the PS5, many tried their luck at installing PT once more. Sadly, the game could be installed, but there was no way of running it. Until now, anyway.

                              <span>The past few years have been torture for any Silent Hill fan. We’ve experienced rumour after rumour, leak after leak, and still haven’t heard so much as a whisper from Konami. It had got to the point where many fans desperately hoped for a new instalment in the pivotal horror series, but many had accepted it might never happen. Instead, we&#x27;ve been left trying - and struggling - to replay some of the best horror games of all time since.
It’s been an entire decade since the last full Silent Hill game, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, and seven years since we were all elated over P.T., before then being scorned by the cancellation of Silent Hills. Needless to say, the journey of being a Silent Hill fan is a rather rocky one.
Well, Konami are full of surprises, it seems. Last night, the official Silent Hill Twitter account shared, “In your restless dreams, do you see that town? The latest updates for the SILENT HILL series, will be revealed during the #SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM PDT.” Yeah, Konami. I’ve been having restless dreams about that town since I was a child; why do you think most of us can’t wait to go back?

Then I played it again to see another ending, even knowing I am a big scaredy baby. Ugh. I will regret having played this next time I clean my flat at night.

The thing is, though, I really dislike slogans; they&#x27;re meant to stir up emotions while bypassing our capacity to think critically. So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.

                              <span>Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s all about pacing. Persona 5&#x27;s blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There&#x27;s a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65&quot; 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.


Basically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn&#x27;t enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn&#x27;t for me. At this point, I&#x27;d invested £100 into my &quot;Do I like Persona 5?&quot; experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm &quot;No, mate, you don&#x27;t&quot;. So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I&#x27;d play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.

                              <span>I finished the original Persona 5 roughly four years ago, and it immediately earned my most coveted award: Edders Really Liked This A Lot, Perhaps More Than Anything Else. Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I&#x27;ve been afraid to make my return. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be itching to delve back into what&#x27;s essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves&#x27; adventure, and yet it&#x27;s precisely because it blew me away the first time that I&#x27;ve been reluctant to go back.
Now? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it&#x27;s wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it&#x27;s the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm. Gi-give, no - give it here!

No, this isn&#x27;t Valve following up their Switch emulator gaffe. Wave hello to the GB Operator.

                              <span>The winner of this year’s Minecraft mob vote has been revealed, and it’s a giant creature called the sniffer. Sniffers are helpful beasties who can search up ancient seeds that grow into plants you can decorate with. The friendly cow-turtle-dog-thing won the vote held to decide Minecraft’s new mob, held for 24 hours between Friday and the start of Minecraft Live on Saturday. Sniffer topped the poll with more than half of the 3.5 million votes cast. You can watch the result being announced in the video below.

                              <span>We might finally be getting another Silent Hill game after a decade of mostly, well, silence. Konami have announced that a “Silent Hill Transmission” is set for this Wednesday, October 19th at 10pm BST / 2pm PDT. No details have been shared about whether you’ll be able to tune in on YouTube or Twitch for the stream, but Konami shared a link to a page on their site so you should be able to watch it there.

                              <span>In a bizarre twist to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series GPU rollout, it turns out there will be no 12GB version of the RTX 4080 at all. Nvidia announced an &quot;unlaunch&quot; of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.


&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right&quot;, reads Nvidia’s statement. &quot;Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the &quot;unlaunch&quot; button on the 4080 12GB.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never actually seen the TV show before but from what little info I could gather, it seems like a bad idea to fuck with the Peaky Blinders. That&#x27;s exactly what I did in this episode of VR Corner (above) though and, to be honest with you, the consequenses are nowhere near as bad as the Shelby&#x27;s make them out to be. In fact, I had a pretty good time!
Earlier this week, I was granted access to a press demo of Peaky Blinders that allowed me to smoke my way through the first few levels of the game. And I do mean smoke in the literal sense because, as you&#x27;ll see in my video, you can spawn and smoke as many virtual cigarettes as you can fit into your lungs. Cough.
Just like with Maze Theory&#x27;s previous TV tie-in, Doctor Who: The Edge of Time, Peaky Blinders: The King&#x27;s Ransom is a superfan&#x27;s dream come true. It gives you the ability to inhabit the world of your favourite TV show, interact with the cast, visit familiar locations and, most importantly, feel like you yourself are a part of the story.

                              <span>We often say that especially clever video games consist of &quot;shades of grey&quot;, but there are just as many shades of blackness. The colour black has a strange, underground career in computer graphics and aesthetics, spread across different types of display and graphics hardware, different genres and art styles. The darkness of a Game Boy game is green-tinged and fertile, like a puddle of algae (and similarly reliant on sunlight). The darkness of a cathode-ray tube display is a dense fog sealed behind a bulging reflection - small wonder that Silent Hill&#x27;s most atmospheric moments came before the advent of flatscreens. 


Black symbolises death in western societies, of course, but it also denotes elegance and luxury, with artisans in every era striving to produce the lushest, finest grades of…</span>

NEWS), and
uploaded it to Debian unstable.
The biggest chunk of work here was fixing some extremely long-standing
issues with how the database is built.  Despite being in the package name,
man-db’s database is much less important than it used to be: most uses of
man(1) haven’t required it in a long time, and both hardware and
software
improvements
mean that even some searches can be done by brute force without needing
prior indexing.  However, the database is still needed for the whatis(1)
and apropos(1) commands.
The database has a simple format - no relational structure here, it’s just a
simple key-value database using old-fashioned DBM-like interfaces and
composing a few fields to form values - but there are a number of subtleties
involved.  Th…</span>

                              <span>The purpose of this post is to demonstrate a first approach to the analysis of multiwavelength kinetic data, like those obtained using stopped-flow data. To practice, we will use data that were acquired during the stopped flow practicals of the MetBio summer school from the FrenchBIC. During the practicals, the student monitored the reaction of myoglobin (in its Fe(III) state) with azide, which yields a fast and strong change in the absorbance spectrum of the protein, which was monitored using a diode array. The data is publicly available on zenodo.

Aims of this tutorial
QSoas to run a simple, multiwavelength exponential fit on the data, and to look at the results. This is not a kinetics lecture, so that it will not go in depth about the use of the exponential fit and its meaning.

                              <span>I’ve released a new tool to manage lockfiles for Arch Linux packages that can’t use a lockfile from the official upstream release. It integrates closely with other Arch Linux tooling like updpkgsums that’s already used to pin the content of build inputs in PKGBUILD.
To use this, the downstream lockfile becomes an additional source input in the source&#x3D; array of our PKGBUILD (this is already the case for some packages).

source&#x3D;(&quot;git+https://github.com/vimeo/psalm.git#commit&#x3D;${_commit}&quot;
        &quot;composer.lock&quot;)


You would then add a new function named updlockfiles that can generate new lockfiles and copies them into $outdir, and a prepare function to copy the lockfile in the right place:

 prepare() {
   cd ${pkgname}
   cp ../composer.lock .
}

updlockfiles() {
  cd ${pkgname}
  rm -f composer.lock
  composer update
  cp composer.lock &quot;${outdir}/&quot;
}


To update the package to the latest (compatible) patch level simply run:

updlockfiles


This can also be used in case upstreams lockfile has vulnerable dependencies that you want to patch downstream. For more detailed instructions see the readme.

                              <span>The Simpsons is full of weird jokes, occasionally some of them are about video games, like the time Millhouse played a Waterworld game. And now you can play it!


If you haven&#x27;t seen it, Waterworld stars Kevin Costner, and is a post-apocalyptic world way off in the year 2500, where water levels have risen so high every continent is underwater. In an episode of The Simpsons called The Springfield Files, Millhouse plays an arcade game adaptation of the film, having to pay 40 quarters, a regular amount to play for an arcade game. And now indie dev Macaw45 has made it actually playable, as it was just a small joke in the original episode.


&quot;I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by the fake videogames that were occasionally seen in The Simpsons, and the Waterworld one always stuck out to me as a kid,&quot; explains Macaw45 in the game page&#x27;s description. &quot;Of course it&#x27;s just a short joke poking fun at how expensive the production of the movie was at the time, but this fake game itself with its gigantic Kevin Costner character on the screen who takes a single step before the machine asks for more quarters always made me so eager to know &#x27;what would be beyond that one screen you see in the show.&quot;

                              <span>It sounds like The Super Mario Bros. Movie might be a bit of a musical, as Toad actor Keegan-Michael Key confirms the mushroom man will do a bit of singing.


While it isn&#x27;t clear if the Mario Bros. film will be a full on musical, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb did say earlier this year that it might have a few musical numbers in it, which is sounding a bit more accurate now. Speaking to Variety, Key was asked if the perfect creature known as Toad will do any singing, to which the actor said &quot;he does.&quot;


&quot;I got to improvise a song in ‘Super Mario Bros.,’ which was an absolute blast,&quot; Key continued to explain. &quot;That was just a stick of fun, that whole thing.&quot; The actor also spoke about how he developed the voice, saying he &quot;was working on the voice with my partner and trying to find the voice through the internal journey of the character. And then with the directors [Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic], we sprinkled some things in, we moved it around.&quot;

                              <span>Did you know that a Kingdom Hearts TV series was in development back in the day? Well it was, and the original director shared the pilot earlier this week.


The Kingdom Hearts TV series was an American developed take on the original game, but it never got off the ground. While bits and pieces of the show have appeared online over the years, like storyboards and various pieces of art, a full pilot has been the holy grail that fans have been after for years. Now, director of the project Seth Kearsley has shared the full animatic pilot online, and it honestly isn&#x27;t the worst thing in the world.


The animatic is narrated by Pinocchio&#x27;s Jiminy Cricket, a companion of protagonist Sora in the original game, and fits very well as such considering he keeps a journal of the games events canonically. It&#x27;s definitely rough around the edges, as it&#x27;s an animatic rather than fully animated.

                              <span>David Grivel, who was meant to be directing the upcoming Splinter Cell remake, has apparently left Ubisoft.


As shared by VGC, Grivel shared a post on his LinkedIn where he announced his departure from the studio, though didn&#x27;t explain why he made the decision to do so. &quot;After more than 11 years at Ubisoft, it is now time for me to go on a new adventure,&quot; wrote Grivel in the post.


&quot;11 years is a long time and summing it up in one post is quasi-impossible but I must say, I’ve been lucky. Lucky to work with so many great people over the years. Made so many friends… As for what that new adventure is? Stay tuned.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; servers are currently offline, as a bug from the most recent update is making the game crash.


Earlier this week, the Nintendo of America Twitter account put a tweet to make players aware that it would be taking down servers to investigate an issue with Nintendo Switch Sports. &quot;A bug has been found in the Nintendo Switch Sports Ver1.2.1 update which causes the software to close during the pre-match loading screen,&quot; reads the tweet. &quot;This is unfortunately affecting both online and offline play modes. We have therefore temporarily suspended the rollout of this update.&quot;


In a followup tweet, Nintendo continued &quot;While we investigate to find a solution, Nintendo Switch Sports servers will be temporarily taken offline and online play will not be available during this time. Save data backup is also temporarily suspended. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.&quot;

It shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise to hear that Sword and Shield only have one last update on the way, this one slated for November 1, as reported by Serebii.net. The Wild Area News&#x27; last update will add a number of Pokémon typically not available like Gigantamax Snorlax, marking this is the final Wild Area News update in the game.


The Battle Stadium will also no longer be updated with a ranked season from November 1, and results for the ranked battle season will no longer appear in Pokémon Home, the pocket monster storage box app. Don&#x27;t expect any more online competitions either, as no more are planned, though friendly competitions can still be held, though these won&#x27;t be shown in Pokémon Home from December 1. The Pokémon Company did note that all Y-Comm features will still be accessible though.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s latest update arrived earlier this week, and it appears to be harbouring some secrets that might be pointing towards ray tracing, and maybe even DLC.


The main purpose of Elden Ring patch 1.07 was that PvP and PvE balance are now separated, meaning tweaks to one won&#x27;t affect the other. However, dataminer Lance MdDonald found that some new menu strings that mention ray tracing were found in the code.


Later on, McDonald was able to enable the ray tracing settings, which he shared a look at on his Twitter. He did note that the feature just seems to be broken for the time being, speculating that it could be some missing shaders that are the problem. McDonald also found that with the ray tracing enabled, the game still uses screen space reflections in water, which means the geometry isn&#x27;t rendered twice so it isn&#x27;t too intensive performance wise.

                              <span>Hellena Taylor, the original voice actor of PlatinumGames&#x27; Bayonetta, has called for a boycott of the game after alleging she received an &quot;insulting&quot; pay offer for the role.


It&#x27;s been known for a little while that for whatever reason, Taylor would not be reprising her role as the now pretty iconic witch, as she essentially said as such last year. Earlier this month it was confirmed that prolific voice actor Jennifer Hale would be taking over the role, with the game&#x27;s director Yusuke Miyata saying that, &quot;various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role.&quot; But now Taylor has posted a series of videos on her personal Twitter where she claims that she ultimately had to decline returning due to only being offered $4000 for the performance.


&quot;I am asking the fans to boycott [Bayonetta 3], and instead spend the money that you would have spent on this game donating it to charity,&quot; Taylor asked of fans in the first of four videos she posted on Twitter yesterday, October 15. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want the world. I didn&#x27;t ask for too much. I was just asking for a decent, dignified, living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral.&quot;

                              <span>Warhammer 40K: Darktide&#x27;s closed beta is underway, which you probably already know if you&#x27;re one of the people granted access to test the co-op shooter. If you don&#x27;t have access however, there&#x27;s still time as you can still apply and more players will be let in over the course of this weekend. You might also enjoy watching some streamers play so you have a better sense of it ahead of its release in November.

                              <span>Blocky action RPG Minecraft Dungeons sees the arrival of the mob-packed Fauna Faire, its third seasonal update, on October 19th. Today’s Minecraft Live stream showed more of what to expect from the new season of Minecraft Dungeons, including four-player multiplayer for the Tower, a new merchant who handles enchantments, and a free new jungle biome level. I just like the look of the mob-themed onesies, personally.

                              <span>Minecraft’s next major update will swell the survival sandbox’s roster of player characters to nine, in an effort to make the game more diverse and improve representation. Existing default picks Steve and Alex are going to be joined by seven new characters who reflect the wider world, although Mojang wouldn’t reveal any more about them ahead of today&#x27;s Minecraft Live stream. Not even their names, alas. I was going to suggest Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grub, but then realised that leaves one short. Gandalf, maybe?

We also found out more about what your hero uses to battle against the piglin invasion, and met some of the game’s key allies. Take a look at the trailer below to get a fresh look at to expect when Legends launches in 2023.

During the show, the camel mob, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves, and crafting with bamboo were shown off.
Players will be able to make all sorts of things with bamboo nodes, such as planks, rafts, and more. The chiseled bookshelf will allow you to store up to six books and they can even be used as doors.

News of the release window was dropped during Minecraft Live 2022 which took place today.
Along with the release window, a first look behind the scenes was provided by the development teams at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive. There was a deep dive about what it means to be the defender of the Overworld, as well as a 4-player co-op live demo that showed off the landscape and piglin gameplay.

                              <span>WB Games Montreal shared a couple of interesting tidbits on Gotham Knights yesterday.
The first was a November 29 launch date for the game&#x27;s arena-based experience Heroic Assault which sees up to four-players participating in co-op.
It seems four-player co-op will be limited to that mode, as the main game is only playable either solo or in two-player online co-op, as it does not feature local co-op. Also, Heroic Assault is a gameplay mode separate from the main story campaign and provides a dedicated arena-like environment with specific objectives and enemies to defeat across 20 floors.

                              <span>Activision has detailed how it will use an SMS verification system as a requirement to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
According to the company, players must own a text-enabled mobile phone number to play the game - but only on PC. 
Earlier this week it was reported that Modern Warfare 2 would require players to register a phone number to play the game. It was also noted a pre-paid or VOIP number might not work with the system. At the time, it wasn&#x27;t specified that the requirement was only for PC players, leaving many players concerned.

                              <span>Earlier this year, I shared my thoughts on five incredible mechanical keyboards that had passed over my desk as of early 2022. There was a surprisingly warm response to that piece, and I planned soon to revisit the topic when I&#x27;d tested enough great keyboards to really justify it - next year, perhaps. Scarcely a few months later, and I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to test out nearly a dozen more mechanical keyboards - five of which are well worth writing about. 
So, without further ado, here are five more lovely mechanical keyboards to have been released in 2022, from technological marvels to some uniquely aesthetic creations. Enjoy! 
Over in the Netherlands, keyboard firm Wooting has made a name for itself with a series of analogue mechanical keyboards that offer some unique advantages over more traditional designs. We&#x27;ve gone into more detail in past reviews - see our Wooting Two HE review, for example - but the main idea is that every key&#x27;s movement can be measured, allowing you to turn a key into an analogue input, trigger different effects at different key depths and so on. Their latest board is the Wooting 60 HE, a 60 percent size model that is ideally suited for the competitive-minded gamers that are most likely to be interested in its feature set.

                              <span>Developer Media Molecule&#x27;s impressively flexible PlayStation creation tool Dreams is celebrating Halloween this year with the return of its annual All Hallows&#x27; event, this time beckoning players to take a spooky trip to the Land of Lost Dreams.


This latest journey to the realms of spookidom is the third Halloween event for Dreams, following previous outings that saw Media Molecule collaborating with its community to create explorable haunted houses and then, last year, a creepy old fairground.


Things are getting a little more fantastical this time around, however, with a quest to the far-flung Land of Lost Dreams, where players can embark on a quest full of odd characters and puzzles as they attempt to uncover a &quot;rich and unnerving history&quot;.

Switch Sports&#x27; version 1.2.1 update launched earlier this week, aiming to further strengthen measures against what Nintendo called &quot;disruptive behaviours&quot; online, as well as pledging to suspend any online players violating its Community Guidelines. Punishable actions included &quot;fraudulent behaviour such as save data manipulation.&quot;


Unfortunately, patch 1.2.1 also introduced a significant bug causing crashes - whether playing online or offline - during the pre-match loading screen.

                              <span>OlliOlli World is poised to receive its second and final expansion on 2nd November - and developer Roll7 has offered a closer look at its skybound skating hijinks ahead of its arrival.


Finding The Flowzone, as the new expansion is known, takes OlliOlli World&#x27;s acclaimed skating action high above Radlandia, with players roaming the clouds in a fantastical floating boat alongside the infamous Radmospheric Three - &quot;grizzled sea-dog Captain Squid, the prim and proper Professor Planks, and the mystically inclined Christopher Licht&quot;. 


Ultimately, the goal is to reach the fabled city of Radlantis, meet the legendary Gail Force, and compete before the Skate Godz to earn the Radlantis Rivals Cup. First, though, players must complete courses set among the clouds, with some familiar Radlandia sights providing the backdrop.

                              <span>&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it&#x27;s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we&#x27;re pressing the &#x27;unlaunch&#x27; button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,&quot; says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases.
Unveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC&#x27;s 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it&#x27;s fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.
The table below reveals that the spec differential wasn&#x27;t just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.

                              <span>EA Motive has been uncommonly talkative throughout the development of its Dead Space remake, with the studio hosting various livestreams to show off the likes of its improved art, audio, and gameplay changes - but now, with the game&#x27;s 27th January launch inching ever nearer, we&#x27;ve had our clearest look yet at how all those elements will come together, courtesy of a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough.


Hot on the heels of last week&#x27;s 2-minute gameplay trailer, EA celebrated Dead Space&#x27;s 14th anniversary today with an extended sequence from the remake&#x27;s third chapter, in which protagonist Isaac must explore the infested USG Ishimura in order to reach the ship&#x27;s engineering deck take and repair its engines.


The sequence began in Ishimura&#x27;s hanger - an area that&#x27;s now much bigger than it was in the original (a side-by-side comparison made the differences abundantly clear) - with players now able to zero-g their way around the area. Some of remake&#x27;s environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.

                              <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event&#x27;s first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. 


 These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.


Niantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is a sequel if you take it on the face value of its title but it&#x27;s more accurate to say it&#x27;s a major update, replacing the original 2016 game on every platform. This isn&#x27;t a sequel in the traditional sense clearly. Rather, it represents a change to how a familiar, well-loved game looks and plays. From a Digital Foundry perspective the headline is that with a new Overwatch 2 app rolling out, developer Blizzard actually uses this as an opportunity to release it as a proper, native PlayStation 5 app. For the first time, PS5 now benefits from several next-gen upgrades which til now Xbox Series X and S owners have been enjoying in Overwatch. So how does PS5 hold up with new features like 120Hz, and a native 4K resolution? And also, how much of an actual visual upgrade is Overwatch 2…</span>

                              <span>After eight years, the Destiny franchise is moving on from its various destination materials - the Spinmetal, Helium Filaments and Relic Iron you could zoom around on your Sparrow vehicle and harvest while patrolling the series&#x27; many planets and moons.


Some of my earliest memories from Destiny 1 are of looping the Cosmodrome for Spinmetal Leaves, hopping off my Sparrow to gather them, then heading off to the next node. Levelling your gear - which in turn levels your character - required plugging bits of these resources in, and I don&#x27;t want to think about the number of hours I spent grinding these out.


Now, or rather as of Destiny 2&#x27;s upcoming Season 19, the materials themselves will no longer be available to acquire - although you can still go zooming around on your Sparrow if you want to.

Also, from this date the Battle Stadium will no longer update with a ranked season and results will not appear in Pokémon Home.

A couple of days ago, a teaser was released where Iono, a new gym leader character described as an influencer and livestreamer within the Pokémon universe, asked viewers to guess what her partner Pokémon was.

We were given the following clues: appearance-wise it&#x27;s squishy, sluggish with an easygoing vibe, and has &quot;two big ol&#x27; bumps on its noggin that people always mistake for eyes&quot;. And it&#x27;s &quot;so cute&quot;, according to Iono.

                              <span>A major new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game is in the works from Invoke Studios, the rebranded developer of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance formerly known as Tuque Games. 


The project is being lead by Dominic Guay, a 20-year veteran of Ubisoft who worked on Splinter Cell before rising to become senior producer of Watch Dogs and its sequel.


Invoke owner and D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast announced the new project this week with only a few details: that it will have a triple-A scope, and be developed on the Unreal 5 engine.

In its latest developer blog post, Blizzard detailed its &quot;current thinking on hero balance and gameplay&quot;, including map rotation and player ranking.


&quot;While some heroes are performing better than others, and there are differences across player skill levels, we have been happy to see that no hero&#x27;s overall power level is far out of line with our goals,&quot; Blizzard said.

Baby Shark, the children&#x27;s song that went viral a few years ago thanks to South Korean educational entertainment company Pinkfong, is getting an &quot;open-world adaptation&quot;.

The game will be a collaboration between Baby Shark Games, a subsidiary of Pinkfong, and Retro Future, a developer who specialises in pixel games.

As shared via Nintendo of America&#x27;s own Twitter, this latest foray into the world of Mario inspired timepieces introduces us to two new watches. 


The first is the standard Chronograph, which is limited to 3000 pieces. This watch features several Mario Kart references across its face, including icons of Power Stars and the like where you would usually see the date showing up. Meanwhile, the Mario Kart logo can be seen etched on the back.

What&#x27;s more, references have been found to two new maps that don&#x27;t yet exist in the game.

In a new blog post, Activision confirmed it would require a text-enabled mobile phone number to play the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC, and also Warzone 2.0.


This will not apply on console, however, or to anyone on PC who verified their account to play the existing Warzone previously.

Key, who studied theatre at university, has sung on-screen previously in the TV series Schmigadoon! and Netflix&#x27;s Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey.

Now we know more about how this monstrous humanoid came to be, at least in terms of his conception - and it turns out he was inspired by background characters from the 1995 film Braveheart.


Sharing this titbit on Twitter, Silent Hill 2 director Masahiro Ito revealed the film&#x27;s executioners that pop up when Mel Gibson&#x27;s William Wallace is being hung, drawn and quartered, were the &quot;inspiration for the background of Pyramid Head from [Silent Hill 2]&quot;.

                              <span>Rat-infested adventure sequel A Plague Tale: Requiem won&#x27;t officially be released until next week, but footage showing large chunks of its campaign is now popping up online. 


The game&#x27;s developer Asobo has now warned those with early copies not to ruin Requiem&#x27;s story - posting a picture of a knight being consumed by thousands of plague rats as a warning of what will happen should you spoil things for others.


Digital copies of the game will unlock at midnight local time next Tuesday, 18th October, but it appears some early physical copies have been sent out early. Eurogamer has spotted some big spoilers doing the rounds - so be careful where you click if you want to go in blind.

                              <span>There is no birth without sex, no life without birth, no birth without life, and no life without death. This cyclical motif is sewn throughout Scorn, running through it like a rotting umbilical cord. It&#x27;s a world where animal and automation are fused together in an uneasy alliance, blended so seamlessly you&#x27;re never entirely sure where organic matter ends and machine begins.


For such a taciturn game - Scorn has no text prompts, no dialogue, and no map; you move through its world by organic exploration, hope, luck, and nothing more - this circle-of-life stuff is surprisingly in your face. Before you&#x27;re out of the opening hour, you will have pried a deformed form from a rotting egg and ripped an organic weapon from its umbilical holster moments before you&#x27;re soaked in a thick, milky substance so overwhelming, it knocks you out. At the end, there are statues in, uh, compromising positions. Swollen abdomens and yes, more umbilical cords. Subtle this is not.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Scorn is ripe with phallic imagery and actions. Our protagonist - a half-dead husk of a humanoid roaming around a (mostly) deserted alien world - endlessly thrusts their weapon into mysterious holes and sinks their fingers into fleshy control panels. There are holes and tubes and thrusting pistons - enough to make Freud blush - all openly inspired by the nightmare dreamscapes of the grimly delightful H.R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksiński. It is stunningly disgusting and disgustingly stunning in all the right ways and for all of Scorn&#x27;s faults - and I have a few, I&#x27;m afraid - its meticulously detailed aesthetic is not one of them.

                              <span>Overwatch is a superhero story, and if there&#x27;s one thing superheroes adore doing in their marketing materials, it&#x27;s staring dramatically outward at something you can&#x27;t see. Overwatch 2&#x27;s launch menu art is a classic example of this - and also, a convenient cross-section for the game&#x27;s wonderfully varied, albeit mostly returning characters. There&#x27;s Tracer, original mascot and the game&#x27;s worst troll, using her teleport dash to mess up the enemy rearguard, then rewinding herself to safety. There&#x27;s Mercy, a single-target healer who handles like a ninja given a well-spaced team, with the ability to swoop towards allies. And Genji, an actual ninja - terrifying with his sword unsheathed, a puny, scuttling annoyance to any hero whose shots he can&#x27;t parry.

                              <span>Hello! Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we&#x27;ve found ourselves playing over the last few days. This time: Doomlikes, classic raids, and Kevin Costner.
If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
Ripping and tearing my way through the original DOOM games was easily some of the best gaming experiences of my youth. That series has some of the most memorable weapons to have featured in a video game and they’re a joy to use, but DOOM 2’s Super Shotgun felt especially amazing. I can still hear the incredible ‘BOOM’ it made as it fired, and that super satisfying trio of clicks that it made as new shells were loaded into it. The best bit though was the way that any hellspawn unlucky enough to be stood right in front of the barrel would just burst into gibs as soon as you pulled the trigger. It delivered such stupidly incredible carnage, it was overexaggerated, amped-up annihilation and up until recently, it felt like one of the most powerful video game guns I’d ever fired.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back discussing Microsoft&#x27;s big Activision Blizzard deal and the latest developments in the ongoing saga of the $68bn buyout being finalised.

Yesterday, Microsoft leapt upon the latest concerned update from the UK&#x27;s deal regulator and repeatedly tried to minimise its own importance in the video games market. Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation&#x27;s userbase would be &quot;significantly larger&quot; than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony&#x27;s own complaints about the deal at face value. 

Is this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead.

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence, the new narrative adventure from developer Dramatic Labs, will no longer release this year as originally planned and is now expected to arrive on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation in April 2023.


Resurgence, which was announced at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, takes place after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, telling its story from the alternating perspectives of two different characters - First Officer Jara Rydek and Engineering Crewperson Carter Diaz - with gameplay said to consist of playable cinematic sequences.


Everything shown so far points to an experience very much in the same vein as the interactive narrative adventures pioneered by Telltale Games - which isn&#x27;t particularly surprising given that Dramatic Labs was founded by controversial former Telltale Games boss Kevin Bruner, and includes around 20 former Telltale employees.

Grabbed a bit of breaky on the go. And then hopped into your car or made your way to the train, bus, or subway. And you dealt with others doing the same before arriving at work to do exactly what you did last week, and the week before, and so on.
It can get a bit tedious.
But put that all behind you now. It&#x27;s 4pm, which means the weekend has started. Unless you work odd hours. If so, we apologize for getting your hopes up. But, for the majority, it is indeed time to throw off the crosspiece fastened over your neck, and as Frankie would say, relax.

                              <span>A Dead Space Anniversary Livestream was held earlier today, followed by multiple previews and an extended gameplay trailer of the upcoming remake.
The PlayStation Blog was one of the outlets that went hands-on with the title, and it had plenty to say about it.
You already know that there is Zero-G freedom of movement, no loading screens, it&#x27;s extra gory, and that Isaac is fully voiced. But did you know he can observe Necromorph transformations in real-time and similar to the beginning of Dead Space 2? If not, now you do.

                              <span>Advancements in PC graphics always move at a breakneck speed, but it does feel like things have been moving particularly quickly of late. Every recent new generation features leaps that are an order of magnitude larger than the last - though keeping up has also involved breaking the bank, either due to initially high vendor pricing or ridiculous gouging driven by crypto nonsense. The trend continues with Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 4090 - a jaw-droppingly powerful new flagship card with a neat party trick: it breaks performance measurement.

What I mean by this is that the 4090 routinely and quite effortlessly does what I’ve only seen other cards do in very specific circumstances: it hits the point at which games can’t perform any better - not because of the card, but because the CPU can’t keep picking up what this beastly GPU is throwing down. This was primarily happening at lower resolutions like 1080p and 1440p but even occurred occasionally at 4K - and it was occurring with relatively recent games like Marvel’s Spider-Man. Maybe this’ll change with the imminent release of Intel’s 13th generation ‘Raptor Lake’ CPUs will help that element of the PC to catch up.

Regardless of what happens there, I feel like this is a pretty potent place to start a discussion about the 4090. At £1650/$1600, it carries an overwhelming price, but what you get for that is also overwhelming performance. This card is the new benchmark, the new high watermark - though it’s really only going to be completely worth it for those who have an entire setup that can support it - which means at the very least a top-range monitor and CPU, plus an overly-healthy amount of RAM.

                              <span>If you’ll allow me to torture an analogy, trying to make the perfect FIFA game must feel a bit like Guardiola’s vintage Barcelona side trying to beat Jose Mourinho’s 2009-10 Champions League-winning Inter team. You can do seemingly everything right, but for all the swashbuckling beauty and idealism of the world’s best attacking teams, there’s nothing like the obstinate force of reality to bring everything tumbling down. 

FIFA 23 takes another crack at the impossible balancing act that presents itself to EA Sports every 12 months, with accessible, realistic football simulation on one side and intense gameplay with an extreme skill gap on the other. 


So while FIFA 23 is yet another utterly compelling dopamine factory that I’ll no-doubt be playing until the day before the next game comes out like every year, it’s still very easy to criticise and will ultimately be as divisive as previous entries over the last 5-ish years have become.

                              <span>The PlayStation 3 was a strange thing. The console, arriving late to the party that the Xbox 360 kicked off quite brilliantly, was a big deal. Certainly, in Sony-owned countries like the UK, it seemed everyone was waiting for it. It didn&#x27;t really matter that the launch line-up was a bit naff, that the console itself looked hideous, or that it was ridiculously expensive. The follow-up to perhaps the greatest console of all time, the PS2, was a huge deal.
But what exactly were people desperate to play on their new PS3? I was at the March 2006 UK launch, somewhere in London, probably in a store that no longer exists and is now a Greggs. While there we interviewed the now Stadia-failer Phil Harrison – who is essentially a giant. I&#x27;d never spoken to a man so intimidatingly large before. Phil, as big a deal as he was in his PlayStation days (lots of ducks, etc) was not my highlight of the evening. Oh no. It was the public. More specifically, the actual batshit reasons some of them were buying a new PS3 a billion pounds.
 
One person, a young man with a pencil-thin moustache, quite enthusiastically told me: &quot;Sonic.&quot; This took me by great surprise, so much so that I almost laughed for the first time since BBC2 comedy show &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; aired in 1995. But I digress. This person was queueing for hours in order to spend £425 (plus the price of the game) to play a utterly terrible Sonic game, which everyone knew was terrible as it had been released on the Xbox 360 the previous year.

                              <span>A beloved Halloween event is returning to Rainbow Six: Siege today. For all you Grims and Ghouls out there, Doktor’s Curse will be available to play up until November 2, allowing players to skulk and hide from the dreadful dead in the Doktor’s Castle map.
Players on the defending team will have to hide from a monstrous attacking team coming at them with only breaching hammers and a single tracking gadget, making use of their environment and survivalist skills to stay undetected with the aid of a variety of unique traps and abilities.
In said game mode, you’ll be able to play as a variety of special monstrous versions of Siege characters, including Orux, Azami, Nomad, Thorn and Gridlock. If you wanna splash a bit of cash and celebrate the spooky season in style, there are bundles for Smoke, Kapkan, Frist, Lesion, Doc, Bandit, Sledge, Lion, Jackal, Aruni, (deep breath) and Ela.

The extremely weird, disturbingly fleshy, unsettlingly phallic, HR Giger-inspired survival horror thingy Scorn finally comes to Gamepass. But, beyond the Promethean aesthetic, what on earth is it all about?


Well... egg redistribution, and poking things in holes. And it might just be one of the most interesting experiences to hit Next Gen to date: something that so heavily and unequivocally leans into its aesthetic, no matter how unsettling things might get, that you have to admire it for its vision alone. There hasn&#x27;t been a mainstream release that goes all-in on grossing out the audience like this since Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, and if anything, Scorn is even more sickening.

                              <span>Scorn comes from the folk over at Ebb Software, and is a simultaneously grotesque and fascinating horror experience. That said, what does everyone actually think of it?
The first-person horror adventure arrives on both PC and Xbox Series X/S today, 14 October, and is also a Game Pass day one release. So, if you’re a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you can install the game for free on PC, Xbox Series X/S, or even try the title out via Xbox Cloud Gaming.
It also happens that Scorn is one of Ebb Software’s first games, and in my humble opinion, it’s an incredibly impressive one at that. It’s an unsettling game that started out with an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign back in 2014, but it’s now managed to find its feet and since run a much more successful campaign.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a rough old launch week for Overwatch 2. As well as a languid and unrewarding battle pass, players have been plagued with connection issues that prevent them from even signing into the game. It&#x27;s been the most Blizzard launch we&#x27;ve seen for some time.
If you do manage to get into the title, you&#x27;ll notice that the gameplay changes (or lack thereof) remain a frequent topic of conversation amongst the Overwatch hardcore. Some are complaining that things feel too similar, whilst others are miffed that the likes of Torbjörn and Bastion got temporarily taken out of the game because they were unfairly buggy.
But, now that we&#x27;ve seen those initial bugs fixed, we&#x27;re not expecting any more massive changes any time soon. The developer behind the title, Blizzard, noted that it isn&#x27;t planning “any immediate balance changes” for any of its heroes, aside from - perhaps – a small alteration to Zarya in one mode.

                              <span>As we approach the launch of Modern Warfare 2, Infinity Ward and Activision have revealed several incentives to get you to play - and finish - the game&#x27;s campaign. Call of Duty is clearly going all out this year to drum up enthusiasm for what&#x27;s traditionally been the game&#x27;s least-played mode.
Like with the beta rewards before them, there are 17 unlocks up for grabs here, and one - the most significant - tied to finishing the campaign. The rewards will be available for use in multiplayer, Special Ops, and in Warzone 2.0 when it launches on November 16.
Each reward is likely tied to finishing certain missions, though the developer did not specify. Nevertheless, if you get early access to the campaign on October 20 by pre-ordering Modern Warfare 2, your unlocks will be ready to use at the launch of multiplayer a week later.

                              <span>Scorn is one of those games that makes my career as a writer rather difficult. I’m expected to be quick with a quip and verbally insightful – and often have something to say about everything and anything – but Scorn continually left me lost for words. That is, except for the continuous swearing I did whenever I found myself stumped by a puzzle or particularly aggressive enemy. Which was often.
This first-person horror game, which is heavily inspired by the artwork of H. R. Giger (of Alien fame) and Zdzisław Beksiński, does a wonderful job of immersing and disorienting you in its desolate, biomechanical world. You – some sort of humanoid – wake up in this unfamiliar place, with no idea as to who or where you are, or what your purpose is. Immediately, however, it becomes clear that you probably want to get some answers and escape this place, and that’s what you set off to try and do.
The alien world you then proceed to explore is so intricately detailed that you’ll find yourself spending time just taking it all in; this facility is a mess of flesh, bones, and rotting mass that you must get to know. And I mean that literally. The environment is not just pretty to look at. It boasts bizarre alien technology in the form of puzzles, all of which connect to each other in one way or another.

Few days back, had posted about the movie Raksha Bandhan and whatever I felt about it. Sadly, just couple of days back, somebody shared this link. Part of me was shocked and part of me was not. Couple of acquaintances of mine in the past had said the same thing for their daughters. And in such situations you are generally left speechless because you don’t know what the right thing to do is. If he has shared it with you being an outsider, how many times he must have told the same to their wife and daughters? And from what little I have gathered in life, many people have justified it on similar lines.  And while the protests were there, sadly the book was not removed. Now if nurses are reading such literature, how their thought process might be forming, you can tell :(. And these are t…</span>

                              <span>The Guile bindings for GnuTLS has been part of GnuTLS since spring 2007 when Ludovic Courtès contributed it after some initial discussion.  I have been looking into getting back to do GnuTLS coding, and during a recent GnuTLS meeting one topic was Guile bindings.  It seemed like a fairly self-contained project to pick up on.  It is interesting to re-read the old thread when this work was included: some of the concerns brought up there now have track record to be evaluated on.  My opinion that the cost of introducing a new project per language binding today is smaller than the cost of maintaining language bindings as part of the core project.  I believe the cost/benefit ratio has changed during the past 15 years: introducing a new project used to come with a significant cost but this is no …</span>

Lars Wirzenius
offering a free basic (6hr) course on the Rust language to interested
free software and open source software programmers.
I know Lars offers training courses in
programming, and besides knowing him for
~20 years and being proud to consider us to be friends, have worked
with him in a couple of projects (i.e. he is upstream for
vmdb2, which I maintain in
Debian and use for generating
the Raspberry Pi Debian images) — He is a
talented programmer, and a fun guy to be around.

I was admitted to the first cohort of students of this course (please
note I’m not committing him to run free courses ever again! He has
said he would consider doing so, specially to offer a different time
better suited for people in Asia)…</span>

                              <span>You can check out the next game from Beeswing and Dujanah developer Jack King-Spooner with a swish demo launched alongside a crowdfunding campaign. Judero is its name, and a surprisingly action-heavy adventure through the Scottish Borders is its game. Expect folklore, witches, jokes, stop motion, and beasties to battle and mind control.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably a coincidence that I have a headache, but it seems appropriate for how out of my depth One Many Nobody was starting to make me feel. You&#x27;ve likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious &quot;standing on your own shoulders&quot; uses.
The balancing of all that didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I&#x27;m generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you&#x27;re more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

                              <span>Star Trek Online turns you into the captain of your own starship. This MMORPG neatly captures the essence of years of Gene Roddenberry’s hopeful, futuristic space romp, rolling in plotlines from the TV shows and movies to create a bizarrely playable blob of nerdy entertainment. It pits you against the Borg. It lets you visit Deep Space Nine. You can even battle the powerful and scary Crystalline Entity that wiped out Data’s homeworld. As a Trek fan, I enjoy Star Trek Online far, far too much.

The game’s developers shared a blog post updating players on how the company are monitoring gameplay, maps, and competitive rankings in the immediate post-launch period. There will, however, be a targeted adjustment to tank Zarya in the next major patch going live on October 25th, Blizzard said.

EA and Motive just held a 14th anniversary livestream in honour of the original Dead Space – ivory, if you were wondering – and I can not-so-safely say that the new footage shown was crisp-gaggingly intimidating. You can check it out for yourself by watching the trailer below. Try not to be too long, won&#x27;t you?

                              <span>A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I&#x27;m alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.
Still, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It&#x27;s all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.

Box are asking just £57 for this Integral M-Series model, which supports 2000MB/s reads and 1600MB/s writes. Compare that to £75.99 for the same drive on Amazon, and you&#x27;ve got the makings of a great deal.

                              <span>Do you like first-person games where you operate complex machinery by manually typing commands into computers and fiddling with buttons and switches and gadgets? Check out the demo for Voices Of The Void, an upcoming game about running a space radio telescope array. Alone. In the woods. It has a pleasing manual process to find, target, and analyse signals, and a whole complex of servers and machinery to mantain. Plus, y&#x27;know, a whole feeling of creeping dread from gazing into space and wondering if anyone is looking back.

                              <span>You know what&#x27;s quite lovely if you can afford it? Having a truly massive hard drive or SSD. Back in the day, I was over the moon when I picked up a 750MB drive for my gaming PC - I could do a full install of Civilization 2! And have room left over for X-Wing Alliance! These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.
That brings me to the subject of today&#x27;s deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market.

                              <span>Headcrab botherers Valve have registered a trademark for something called Neon Prime this week, an application filing has revealed. The application was made through the United States Patent And Trademark Office. Neon Prime’s trademark was listed as for “computer game software, electronic game software, video game software, computer game programs downloadable via the internet”. So, not VR or Steam Deck hardware then.

This is different from the blanket phone registration requirements that Activision Blizzard implemented for Overwatch 2’s Defense Matrix at that game’s launch at the beginning of this month, before removing them for most players last week. Modern Warfare 2 players on both Battle.net and Steam will need to register a number.

Things are working a little differently for 2022’s mob vote, though. Instead of casting your vote on Twitter, you’ll be able to head into a dedicated carnival-themed Bedrock server, do it in the Minecraft launcher, or on Minecraft.net. Devs Mojang will reveal which mob scored the most votes during the Minecraft Live livestream tomorrow.

                              <span>Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.
I was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, &quot;Is there a story?&quot;. And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there&#x27;ll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it&#x27;s a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it&#x27;s about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that&#x27;s already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It&#x27;s about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It&#x27;s about grim squishy noises and survival.
Scorn doesn&#x27;t have dialogue, or a map. It doesn&#x27;t really have a HUD, it doesn&#x27;t have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like &quot;Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it&#x27;ll open up a way forward!&quot; out loud. It won&#x27;t even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don&#x27;t know if I can recommend it.

                              <span>Journey developer ThatGameCompany is doing something a little bit different for the latest season of its gorgeous social adventure Sky: Children of Light, launching a &quot;first-of-its-kind musical experience&quot; in collaboration with Norwegian musician and artist, Aurora.


Aurora - who performed the haunting vocal accompaniment to Idina Menzel in Frozen 2&#x27;s showstopper Into the Unknown, and whose singles include Cure for Me and Runaway - has been heard in Sky before, but she&#x27;ll play a much greater role in its latest season of content.


Appropriately titled Season of Aurora, this will feature a &quot;story told in music&quot; where players can explore the &quot;song-filled memories of Spirits who carried hope through struggle and loss&quot;.

                              <span>If you can somehow still look at your gaming backlog without being consumed by existential dread, here&#x27;s another two additions for your infinitely expanding pile: Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition and Evoland Legendary Edition, both free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Fallout 3 likely needs no introduction, given its lofty place in the gaming pantheon. Released back in 2008, it was Bethesda&#x27;s first foray into the Fallout universe (1 and 2 were the work of Black Isle Studios), expanding on the open-world RPG freedom of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion to deliver a sprawling, dizzyingly rich post-apocalyptic jaunt through The Capital Wasteland.


An &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot; is what Eurogamer called Fallout 3 in 2008, describing it as a &quot;thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks... as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice.&quot; The Game of the Year Edition being given away on Epic includes the base game and all its DLC.

                              <span>Developer Insomniac Games&#x27; formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port&#x27;s system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac&#x27;s original Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, taking the first game&#x27;s acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


&quot;Insomniac&#x27;s second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original,&quot; said Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson wrote in his Recommended review, &quot;but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.&quot;

                              <span>The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to &quot;region-hopping&quot; - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

The service launched back in February 2021 for games to be validated against the Xbox accessibility guidelines and accessibility tags applied. Now, developers can gain feedback from disabled players testing their games.


Microsoft announced this news at today&#x27;s Xbox Accessibility Showcase, celebrating the disability community and those making gaming more accessible.

This agreement with the US National Labor Relations Board concludes Clifton&#x27;s long-running dispute with Nintendo and its contractor agency Aston Carter, through which they were employed to test Nintendo games. 


As part of the deal, Nintendo must also display a notice informing employees (in block capital letters) they &quot;WILL NOT&quot; be fired or stopped from discussing unionisation.

                              <span>Bart and Milhouse often have a rough time of it throughout The Simpsons&#x27; many episodes and seasons. The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as &quot;The Springfield Files.&quot;

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer&#x27;s conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner&#x27;s Waterworld.

Walther is widely known for their detailed and excellent Bloodborne PSX demake, and has been working on the racing project since March.

Their latest update shows off Gehrman, the elderly gentleman who hangs around the workshop inside the Hunter&#x27;s Dream, though I suspect he&#x27;s been modding his ride a bit.

                              <span>The console versions of strategy title Humankind have been delayed &quot;until further notice&quot;.


The game was set for release on 4th November across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S - including day one via Xbox Game Pass - but has met &quot;some unique challenges&quot;.


&quot;We apologise for the inconvenience but rest assured that Sega Europe, Amplitude Studios and Aspyr are working hard to bring the best possible Humankind experience to console players. We can&#x27;t give a timeframe on a new release date right now, but as soon as we are in a position to do so, we will let everyone know and we thank the community for their continued support and understanding,&quot; reads a press release.

The Rock, of course, already exists in Fortnite as one of the game&#x27;s original characters - The Foundation - and has leant his role and likeness to the hero since March last year. 


Now he&#x27;ll appear in character as Black Adam, to tie in with his appearance in the film of the same name, which is set to launch in cinemas next week.

                              <span>Last month Google Stadia officially announced it will shut down its beleaguered cloud gaming service for good in January next year.


Now, in light of this news, the developer behind top-down party battle game and Google Stadia exclusive Outcasters has informed its players that, at this point in time, it &quot;does not have plans to bring [the game] to other platforms&quot;.


In a statement on Twitter, British developer Splash Damage explained that as Outcasters was both designed and built with Stadia specifically in mind, the game&#x27;s systems were &quot;heavily reliant on the platform&quot; and the work required to release it on a different platform was simply too complex at this time.

                              <span>Ever since it sprung from the remnants of Capcom&#x27;s Clover Studios back in 2007, PlatinumGames has become synonymous with a certain brand of over-the-top action; think the knee-sliding shotgun ballet of Vanquish, the stylish sucker punch of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance or the madcap superhero adventure of The Wonderful 101. Throughout all that there&#x27;s been one constant - the devilish and daring Bayonetta, as close as the Osaka studio has as an official mascot, who&#x27;s finally on the cusp of her third outing. Having played a sizable chunk of Bayonetta 3, all signs are pointing towards it being her best yet too. 


Like previous entries, this is an action game cast firmly in the mould of Devil May Cry (Devil May Cry creator Hideki Kamiya returns here as executive director for Bayonetta 3), with whip-quick third-person combat at its core. Unlike something like Devil May Cry 5, however, which saw Capcom retool and refine that core combat towards something like perfection, Bayonetta 3 builds outwards in a work of maximalist beauty. This is a game that throws in the kitchen sink, the dishwasher and tumble dryer and just about anything it can at you, and the result is intoxicating if never exactly coherent. 


There&#x27;s only two sections we&#x27;re free to discuss in this last preview before we give the final verdict, but they illustrate the point perfectly well. First, we&#x27;ve a gauntlet run through modern-day Tokyo with Bayonetta herself, summoned into the real world through an oh-so-fashionable multiverse hook. What it means, in practice, is getting to see Bayonetta transposed onto something like real-life, racing through a city that&#x27;s being destroyed by a colossal shark demon as she surfs atop the giant dragon Gomorrah, crashing along spiralling skyscrapers before donning cruise liners for a set of impromptu water skates. Bayonetta 3, in case you hadn&#x27;t already guessed, does not trade in subtlety.

Details of its rewards are now live on PlayStation&#x27;s UK site, and mirror those available elsewhere. 


This includes the fact some users will &quot;randomly&quot; be placed in a queue for up to two months upon applying to the scheme in order to manage demand. It also includes a perk which will give you &quot;priority&quot; when contacting PlayStation&#x27;s customer support chat.

This latest complaint, filed in Los Angeles by a former employee of the company referred to as Jane Doe, targets both the Call of Duty maker itself and the employee&#x27;s former manager, Miguel Vega. 

Doe is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against the company and her ex-manager. In addition to this, Doe has demanded the removal of Bobby Kotick as CEO, as part of the lawsuit.

The pilot was co-funded by the Commonwealth Games Federation (GF) and the Global Esports Federation (GEF). At the time, the CGF called the pilot a success and expected esports to be held at future Games.

                              <span>A fresh patch is now available for Elden Ring that adds separate damage scaling for PvP.


That means balance adjustments when playing against others online, such as increased stamina attack power and a decrease in the power of Ashes of War.


These adjustments do not affect single-player or cooperative play.

                              <span>Sony has now sold 2m units of its PlayStation 5 console in the UK, despite a recent price hike.


It took 98 weeks to reach this number, in-line with sales of the PS3 and making it the joint fourth fastest-selling console in the UK.


Since launch, the console has been hampered with stock shortage issues and remains in high demand. That&#x27;s despite a price increase for UK consumers of £30 back in August, which Sony blamed on inflation.

The mode was not due to be released until later this year, ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar which begins in  November. 


FIFA 23 owners on PlayStation 5 have posted screenshots of the mode on social media, which show four different sub-modes: FIFA World Cup Live, FIFA World Cup Kick-Off, Online Tournament and FIFA World Cup 2022.

                              <span>Sony may have accidentally revealed that PlayStation classic Ridge Racer 2 is on its way to PS Plus.


Yesterday, Sony announced the next slate of games coming to the subscription service in October, including Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Dragon Quest 11, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


PlayStation Access, the official PlayStation YouTube channel, included Ridge Racer 2 in its list of classic games, but this was not included in the PlayStation Blog. The PlayStation Access video has since been updated (thanks VGC).

                              <span>This Monday was World Mental Health Day. Because of this, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some articles on the site that explore mental health and its relationship to games.
Raising awareness about the topic of mental health in general is something I am deeping passionate about, and I have lived with mental illnesses myself for some time now. I take a variety of regular medications to help with this, and, combined with cognitive behavioural therapy, these have worked well for me and my ongoing recovery.
While they aren&#x27;t designed to be therapeutic, games have often provided me with a safe refuge to escape to. This can often include jumping back into a title from my childhood and experiencing that unrivalled nostalgic joy once more (I will forever have a soft spot for The Italian Job on the PlayStation 2 for this very reason).

                              <span>One of my clearest lockdown memories is of going for a lunchtime walk with Olaf Stapledon. It was somewhere near the start of things, I think, no cars on the roads and those government mandated exercise breaks still feeling weirdly illicit. There is a stretch of the South Downs behind my house which I am ashamed to say I had never visited until Covid. One morning I set out over the gentle grassy hump of its hill, over the buried spine of the thing, with the almost indescribable vastness of Stapledon&#x27;s novel Star Maker playing in my headphones.


Star Maker is all about a journey through the cosmos - deep into space and out the other side, really. But that day its wild intergalactic journey actually served to root me more deeply in the landscape I was exploring. I remember the broken chalky earth where the badgers make their sets, the dew pond with its looping swallows, a lonely bench pointed at nothing where I sat in silence for a space of time that was maybe twenty minutes, maybe an hour. I was learning, all the time. Over the course of that morning ramble I learned afresh how to be in nature.


And this is exactly what Paradise Marsh teaches. It&#x27;s a small game, but also a gigantic one: truly a Stapledonian trick of time and space. I load it up and explore a colourful endless wetlands, cycling through day and night, spring, summer, autumn and winter. There&#x27;s an objective of sorts - I&#x27;m armed with a net as I plod around and I have a book of creatures to capture - but it&#x27;s an objective I have not really focused on for the most part. Instead I wander. I watch and listen, I see the different shades of the sky as it moves from peach to strawberry yogurt to dark bubbling storm clouds. I enjoy the rain one moment and the snow the next. I enjoy the silence - my silence.

                              <span>EA has triumphantly termed the recently-released FIFA 23 as &quot;record-breaking&quot; - for hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, and having the &quot;biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history&quot;.


FIFA 23 is, of course, also the last EA Sports FIFA franchise release in history - with the series set to transition to EA Sports FC from next year. 


Signs were good that FIFA 23 had performed well at launch this year. Launched on 30th September, the game&#x27;s first week of UK boxed game sales slightly beat those of FIFA 22 - despite the overall trend of declining physical game sales in favour of digital.

                              <span>With Starfield&#x27;s hugely anticipated 2023 release growing ever-closer, Bethesda has launched a new Q&amp;A video series, and episode one sees director Todd Howard responding to a number of community queries - including sharing some thoughts on whether Starfield can be described as a &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; game.


Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield&#x27;s inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you&#x27;re wondering - before moving on to tackle the &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; question.


While he admitted the answer will very much depend on an individual&#x27;s definition of &quot;hard sci-fi&quot;, he said, &quot;It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here&#x27;s how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that&quot;.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it&#x27;s way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it&#x27;s discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!
So: let&#x27;s cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it&#x27;s nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you&#x27;re paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you&#x27;ll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5).

                              <span>It was announced back in June that Spider-Man: Miles Morales would arrive on PC shortly after Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered. And so it is. The date is November 18th, and there&#x27;s a new PC trailer below with the requisite big writing talking about new graphics features.

                              <span>I have wanted to play Triangle Strategy since it was first announced for Nintendo Switch, but I realise now that I know next to nothing about it. All I&#x27;ve done is look at its screenshots and salivate at the mixture of 2D sprites, 3D environments, and tilt-shift camera trickery. 

Beyond that, I know that it&#x27;s a strategy RPG, and I know that it&#x27;s out on PC as of today.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red recently updated Cyberpunk 2077 to add items from the new anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Their own updates didn&#x27;t add the show&#x27;s omnipresent risk of cyberpsychosis, however, so a modder has stepped in to do it for them. The Wannabe Edgerunner mod adds a &quot;humanity&quot; cost to all cyberware implants and certain actions in the open-world shooter, as well as consequences for when your humanity gets too low.

                              <span>We celebrate all three of us being back on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, but two thirds of us being be-plagued, by talking about rejuvinating the Earth - truly, the podcast host of us all. Inspired by new eco-friendly farming game Coral Island, which I&#x27;ve been playing this week, we talk about our favourite games that roll with an ecological protection theme. This is hard for Matthew, because he hates the environment (unless his immediate environment contains a can of Rio).
Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

                              <span>Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they&#x27;ll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope&#x27;s Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares&#x27; Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it&#x27;s Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You&#x27;re still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

The beta is running from now until the end of October to trial planned changes and rummage up some feedback for Stellaris’ next update, 3.6 Orion. Don’t worry if you just fancy playing regular Stellaris; this is an opt-in thing. You can find out more by watching the video below.

                              <span>A video that appears to have been sent to playtesters of Ubisoft’s mysterious session-based co-op shooter Project U has been shared on Twitter. It mostly consists of clips of the game’s dev team talking about playtests, but there are a few sections of gameplay and other footage from the game itself interspersed between those. Creative director Damien Kieken appears in the video, saying that the U in Project U “stands for Unite”.

                              <span>Fantasy construction sim Dwarf Fortress is, by the admission of its designers, difficult to learn and even harder to master. That’s why the game’s Steam version will have its own tutorial. Co-creator Zach Adams has roped in a novice playtester to try the tutorial out, in the form of his wife Annie.

Describing it as “completely revamped”, the Android and iOS apps are essentially new and add a way to sign into your account on PC using a QR code, remote downloads from your Library, and customisable tabs. If you really enjoy looking at videos of swiping around on phones then you can watch Valve’s below.

You can watch Howard chatting about the make-believe space programme below, where he covers if Starfield is hard sci-fi (not really), the games traits system, and dialogue. It seems that Starfield RPG&#x27;s are incredibly chatty, with many times more dialogue than Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s PS5 has generated £919 million in the UK, with 2 million units sold since it was made available in 2020.
The figure makes it the fourth console in the region to make it to that figure. The first on the list is Wii, followed by PS2 and PS4, respectively, with PS5 and PS3 coming in even at 98 weeks (thanks, GI.biz).
Yet, PS5 is number one when it comes to money, even though its sales performance has been marred by stock shortages. Compared to PS5, Wii generated £358 million at two million unit sales, PS4 £700 million, and Xbox One generated £726 million with 2 million unit sales.

From now until October 18, the Hoops event is live which, instead of revelling in the lovely, relaxing, embracing football we’ve grown, we’ve gotten another basketball arena. I’m shaking.
That’s right, with a new arena called “The Block”, players will be able to shoot balls into — get this — large circular hoops at each side of the arena, as opposed to the smaller, elegant goals Rocket League is known for.
There’s more! With the new arena and event there’s challenges are rewards to dive — or drive — into. Rewards include the illustrious new game time player anthem, and the animated double dribble topper. What a mouthful, and one you’ll want to nab before the event goes forever.

Entering the same crowded marketplace that includes behemoths like Destiny and Warframe, and the corpses of high-profile failures like Anthem, must be a daunting prospect. But Korean developers Nexon have gone and done it anyway, and the result is The First Descendant, an extremely “one of those sorts of games” effort that seems to blend elements from every single one of its genre contemporaries into a sort of gloop.


And, look, gloop isn’t necessarily a bad thing, right? Everyone likes gloop. Custard. Rice pudding. Angel delight. Dessert metaphors aside, the thing about The First Descendant is that it feels almost aggressively mid: intent, almost, on existing as a mathematical average of all these other games instead of actively trying to carve out a niche of its own.

The images also reveal there will be 48 teams available to play in the mode, which is 16 more than the 32 teams that qualified for the World Cup.

                              <span>Bethesda has released a new video called Constellation Questions, and it features Todd Howard answering questions about Starfield.
The video goes over whether or not the game can be considered &quot;hard sci-fi&quot;, how games such as Sundog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller inspired the team behind Starfield, and how the fuel in your ship and the gravity drive limits how far you can go at once.
It&#x27;s all very interesting, but one of the biggest talking points in the video relates to the trait and dialogue systems.

                              <span>PlatinumGames hasn’t exactly had the hottest streak lately. Babylon’s Fall was an exemplary lesson in how not to do a service game, it lost the job of making Granblue Fantasy: Relink to Cygames back in 2019, and even Astral Chain failed to really get the traction you’d see from keystone series like Bayonetta or Nier. The studio, regrettably, has been stuck in a rut.


But, with Bayonetta 3, Platinum comes dancing and jiving out of this lull in an explosion of keratin and Umbran magic. From the opening minutes – no, the opening seconds – Bayonetta 3 says “the witch is back, darling” and kicks any and all of your expectations to the curb. The languid pace of Astral Chain’s opening hours have been forgotten, the sub-par combat and service model of Babyon’s Fall cast aside; this is Platinum firing on all cylinders once again. And, damn, does it feel good.


Everything you remember about Bayonetta and its sequel is present and accounted for: the razor-sharp combat, the best-in-class Witch Time dodging, the frantic-yet-measured melee, the over-the-top set pieces. Yet, somehow, Bayonetta 3 takes everything from the first two games that made you grin like a gremlin and dials it up even more.

                              <span>FromSoftware rolled out a big new update for Elden Ring following server maintenance. This is the game&#x27;s first patch since August, and it arrived earlier this morning on all platforms.
Update 1.07&#x27;s biggest new addition is separating PvP balance from single-player and co-op. In other words, scaling for weapons, skills, spells etc. will now have different values in PvP in order to better balance the experience.
Patch 1.07 heralds the start of this approach to balance, and it&#x27;s the one FromSoft will be relying on moving forward. As a result, today&#x27;s update introduces several balance tweaks that only affect PvP gameplay. Stamina attack power has been increased for all attacks against guarding players, except when using long-ranged weapons.

                              <span>Sony has come forward and announced the PlayStation Stars Loyalty Program for the UK, a new-ish way to show your dedication to squeezing every drop of content, scrounging for every secret, and mastering ever aspect of games you buy on your shiny PS5 or trusty PS4. You can sign up for the program totally for free, granted you have a PlayStation Plus membership.
Here’s how it works.With the launch of PlayStation Stars campaigns will be introduced, which will essentially be limited-time goals and activities players can take part in. Doing so, in addition to collecting trophies from a variety of PlayStation titles, will reward you with points and even shiny digital collectables, which you can place in a new display case on your PlayStation mobile app.
While the collectables aspect is good and all, especially for trophy hunter types who I imagine will be showing off their digital collection to strangers on the bus and train. It’s the points that may really catch your attention though, as they can be exchanged for a variety of genuinely valuable stuff, like whole games and DLC. So, it is like an actual loyalty program, rather than just a dressed-up trophies 2.0.

                              <span>Valve rolled out a major update to the Steam mobile app, reworking it entirely for the better. The update is available on iOS and Android, and it follows Steam&#x27;s modern design language.
As for features, this new version is packed with quality of life tweaks, as well as new security and convenience additions. Most existing features remain, with one exception.
The new Steam mobile app&#x27;s most important addition is the ability to queue downloads and updates remotely to your PC, provided it&#x27;s on and you&#x27;re logged into Steam. The feature has been a staple on consoles for years, so it&#x27;s about time it made its way to PC.

                              <span>Eight years ago I referenced the Seinfeld Streak used in an earlier post of regular updates to to the Rcpp Gallery:
This is sometimes called Jerry Seinfeld’s secret to productivity: Just keep at it. Don’t break the streak.
and then showed the first chart of GitHub streaking 366 days:
github activity october 2013 to october 2014


And seven years ago a first follow-up appeared in this post about 731 days:
github activity october 2014 to october 2015


And six years ago we had a followup at 1096 days
github activity october 2015 to october 2016


And five years ago we had another one marking 1461 days
github activity october 2016 to october 2017


And four years ago another one for 1826 days
github activity october 2017 to october 2018


And three years ago another one bringing it to 2191 days
github activity october 2018 to october 2019


And two years ago another one bringing it to 2557 days
github activity october 2019 to october 2020


And last year another one bringing it to 2922 days
github activity october 2020 to october 2021


And as today is October 12 here is the newest one from 2021 to 2022 one bringing it 3287 days:
github activity october 2021 to october 2022

                              <span>An update to the CD Projekt RED support page outlines how Stadia users can download their Cyberpunk 2077 saves.
With Stadia shutting down in January , folks are understandably worried about their save game files. Those who play Cyberpunk 2077 and want to continue playing their game on another platform, need only do the following using Google Takeout, per CDPR.


Open takeout.google.com.
In the &quot;Create a new export&quot; section click &quot;Deselect all&quot; and select &quot;Stadia&quot;. Press &quot;Next Step&quot; to continue.
Choose your preferred destination and “Export once” frequency. Choose &quot;.zip&quot; file type and &quot;2 GB&quot; size. Press &quot;Create Export&quot;.
Download the export from the destination chosen in the previous step.
Locate the downloaded archive on your PC. Extract it.
Your Cyberpunk 2077 game saves will be located in the following path: .../Takeout/Stadia/GAMING/GAME_SAVE/
Note that there may be saved files from other games located there as well. 
Files of each game save are located inside archives. Extract them to separate folders.
To use the extracted saves on the PC version, simply copy-paste those folders to the following path: %userprofile%\Saved Games\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077
Make sure that files are not nested inside another folder.

Volition said it is working to improve the gameplay experience with fixes to community-reported issues and more improvements based on player feedback.
Because the team is prioritizing fixes, development on extra content has been put on hold for the time being. You can expect the first major update in late November, and it will contain over 200 bug fixes and stability upgrades.

                              <span>^Stay tuned after the ads for our Street Fighter 6 Beta impressions, and loads of pristine PS5 footage.


Fighting games are often fraught with netcode issues, matchmaking discrepancies, and general annoyances that tend to make the online experience a pale shadow of the immediacy and excitement of IRL tournaments, or just hanging around in an arcade in the nineties. This isn’t a problem unique to fighting games, of course: Zoom calls are mince compared to spending proper time with your mates. It is what it is.


Capcom however appear to have nailed many of these issues in the Street Fighter 6 closed beta, which finished on Sunday, and impressed us with its smooth, generally lag-free presentation (even managing to put in a good show over wifi), and a social space that really does feel like hanging around in an arcade, complete with actual machines to sit down at in order to challenge nearby players to bouts.

                              <span>Square Enix has announced it will be ending service for Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier on January 23, 2023.
The company said that despite all its efforts to provide regular updates with new content, it could not deliver the experience it was hoping to and one that players deserved. Therefore, it has decided to end service for the mobile game.
The multiplayer battle royale shooter was released on Android and iOS in November 2021 after extensive testing. Set in Midgar 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy 7, in it you play as one of many Soldier candidates, all vying for survival to prove their worth for the Shira military.

                              <span>Stripe is coming to MultiVersus tomorrow, providing the second big hit of Gremlins love to the platform fighter in recent months. This came suddenly via the official MultiVersus Twitter account, which made the announcement alongside an in-game picture of the little monster.
Stripe has been present in MultiVersus via the menu screen for a little while now, soft announcing the character alongside Black Adam as upcoming fighters. That being said, other characters such as Rick and Morty from… Rick &amp; Morty have stepped in ahead of the teased pair.
As for how Stripe is going to play, we frankly have absolutely no clue whatsoever. However, if Gizmo is this madcap, popcorn throwing and car driving maniac, you can only imagine how aggressive and ruthless his evil counterpart will be. For those of you out there who don’t know what Gremlins is, it’s a 1984 movie that was apparently a big hit back in the day. I wouldn’t know because I’m not ancient, and haven’t seen a video player anyway outside an Oxfam.

                              <span>Earlier this week, we finally got an insight into just how much Microsoft earns from its Xbox Game Pass service thanks to some data coming out of Brazil&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (or CADE, if you&#x27;re fancy). Per figures gleaned from the data, it was revealed that Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021 (not including Xbox Game Pass for PC).
But that may have raised the question about how much Microsoft spends on games as it adds them to the service. We know Microsoft&#x27;s Chris Charla has admitted to paying developers and publishers &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; in Game Pass license fees since the subscription service first came to our consoles, back in 2017. But we&#x27;ve never really had a specific figure to attach to Xbox Game Pass – or even Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service rival, PS Plus.
That&#x27;s changed now, though. Over on Twitter, Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach posted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by Snail Games USA  – who you may recognise as the parent company of Studio Wildcard, the developer behind Ark: Survival Evolved. And it shows a fascinating insight into how much platform holders are paying to feature titles in their monthly line-ups and services.

                              <span>Witchfire is a game shooter fans have been looking forward to since its initial reveal all the way back in December 2017. It&#x27;s getting close to five years already, and though we were hoping to finally get our hands on it this year, this sadly won&#x27;t be happening.
Developer The Astronauts announced today that it has pushed back the early access release of the game to sometime in early 2023.
In a blog post, the developer revealed that it&#x27;s changing the game&#x27;s combat flow from arena-style encounters to the more organic open-world combat. This is significant enough to warrant that delay, but the good news is that the feature is &quot;95% implemented.&quot;

                              <span>When Capcom revealed that Street Fighter 6 was going to be split into three distinct menu options that each lead to relatively separate experiences, I was curious – but I thought it was just a gimmick. Experiencing the Battle Hub in the beta has shown me that it&#x27;s more than that; it&#x27;s a way to honor the past.

In real terms, the Battle Hub is simply a lobby system. Whereas in Street Fighter 4 or Street Fighter 5 matches were found through matchmaking systems that ran through regular menus, SF6 recontextualizes the wrapper around finding matches into a bizarre sort of Second Life-style, semi-MMO experience where you join a server and literally noodle around a 3D space.

There&#x27;s a bit of cross-over with other modes, too. The character you run around with is created for the single-player World Tour mode, which we&#x27;re yet to see much of – though now we at least know that you can create some wonderfully frightening-looking protagonists for it with a surprisingly open-ended character. The Street Fighter battles you&#x27;ll participate in, meanwhile, are straight out of the versus &#x27;Fighting Ground&#x27; mode I&#x27;ve previewed before – just online, instead of off.

                              <span>John Carpenter never gives a dull interview, and his latest with AV Club is no exception. As a highly esteemed horror filmmaker and composer, and an avid gamer, he also has a lot to say about video games. 
AV Club’s William Hughes asked Carpenter all about the games he’d played, what he likes about them, and even his gaming routine. What quickly emerged was Carpenter’s addiction to Fallout 76, “I got hooked on this Fallout 76 game. Been hooked for a good long time on it. You know, I know it had bugs coming out, and a lot of it was put down, but I thought it was great. It’s really fun to play.” He’d also mentioned he’d been keeping up with Borderlands and Horizon Forbidden West.
It was noted that Carpenter seems to enjoy open-world titles with more exploration, to which he said, “It’s fun. Your freedom to roam around and do it your way. And that’s what I love about Fallout.” There is a template to follow, there are missions, but you can do it differently. And they keep coming up with new missions every once in a while, and new ideas,” Carpenter says.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 has passed 27 million registered players, according to director Naoki Yoshida on a special celebration livestream. The figure was unveiled from a large golden disco ball alongside Square Enix CEO Yosuke Matsuda, which I can now only assume is the way they reveal any big news within the company.
This is an astounding milestone for the game of course, which quickly rose in popularity in the west during both the COVID lockdowns and Activision Blizzard’s epic fumbling of the once lustrous World of Warcraft ball. It became so popular in fact that they had to stop new players from creating accounts!
That’s not all from the livestream either. Alongside the chunky 27 million flex, the team also seemed confident that they could reach 30 million by next year, coincidentally the 10-year anniversary of the MMORPG’s release. With the ever-growing popularity of the title, it’s hard to imagine it not making it to be honest, even with World of Warcraft: Dragonflight launching in late November and tempting back Blizzard refugees who may have jumped ship recently.

                              <span>You know you’ve got a good game on your hands when its Steam Next Fest demo manages to infiltrate – and climb! – the Top 50 Most Played games list in just one week. You know it’s a game worth looking at when critics and consumers alike flock to a demo, eager to see what all the buzz is about. UNDECEMBER has managed to whip up something of a cult following already – and it’s not even out yet. 

It’s probably because the cross-platform hack ‘n’ slash RPG is doing something different. In UNDECEMBER, you take on the role of a Rune Hunter: a hero destined to stop the 13th god of this world – one pre-determined to be evil and unholy – from being born. The other 12 gods shared out their powers and gifts to Rune Hunters, giving humans the ability to prevent the birth of their awful sibling. It’s up to you to hunt down those powers and use them for yourself. 

To that end, in UNDECEMBER, there is no set class. When you boot up the game, you select either a male or female character, adjust your appearance, and then that’s it – you’re in the world. There’s no shaman, demon hunter, warrior, paladin; instead, you build your character with gears and skills of your choice as you move on.

                              <span>It’s time for some more news about that one game we love to complain about right now, and that’s – obviously – Overwatch 2. 
After a rocky launch consisting of congested servers, a controversial SMS Protect system, multiple DDoS attacks, and plenty of other bugs, Blizzard are attempting to make good by offering a digital goodybag to players.
Even then, this digital goodybag certainly falls under the mark when it comes to making reparations with players. In a recent tweet on the Overwatch account, Blizzard said that, “When #Overwatch2 launch is bumpy, you make it up to players. Besides making progress on bug fixes &amp; stabilization, we&#x27;ve got goodies to share with all players.”

Well, good news chums, EVGA&#x27;s RTX 2060 SC Gaming model is available for £212 - and despite costing 12.5% the price of the RTX 4090, it delivers at least 25% of the performance - nice. That&#x27;s like, double the value!

                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of the best gaming monitors in the world - or at least, that&#x27;s what I keep telling myself after buying one last year. This is a 32-inch model, offering a 2560x1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate and a DisplayHDR 600 certification that means it actually delivers impactful HDR - a rarity at this price point. Anyway, it&#x27;s down to £499 today after a £100 discount, so listen up - here&#x27;s why I rate this monitor so highly.

But I might enjoy this one week of exploring a gorgeous desert, climbing and gliding and hoverbiking, and you might too.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve long been excited about the possibilities offered by upcoming tidying things up nicely game A Little To The Left, and back in May this year Alice0 (one of us is RPS&#x27;s Mirror Universe Alice, but nobody knows which) finally had a crack at it. The way she wanted to organise keys wasn&#x27;t what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a &quot;domestic Joker&quot;.
The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who&#x27;s a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

                              <span>Friends, let me admit something up top. I am the most tedious of Dead Rising apologists. I love its in-game timer. I adore its linear mission structure that is completely at odds with the expansive semi-open world shopping mall in which it takes place. Hell, I even like its severely stripped down Wii port. I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks.

                              <span>Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they&#x27;re well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Each and every week the game pile grows higher, forming the walls of a virtually impenetrable digital structure known only as the ‘backlog’. As the games multiply, thickening the increasingly cell-like walls of our den of entertainment, we can only gaze on and hope it doesn’t one day become our tomb. On that light note, it’s nice to see that SteamDB now has a section showing what games are coming out on Steam every week.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one thing that brings stability to my life, it&#x27;s the escapism of reality TV. Below Deck: Mediterranean had me covered last winter (alongside its Sailing Yacht spin-off), as I watched super yacht crew toil to meet the demands of the wealthy and unhinged. Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed &quot;I licked her tit or whatever,&quot; in a shock revelation to his betrothed.
What&#x27;s on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It&#x27;s on Netflix and I&#x27;m convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.

                              <span>Defining boomer shooter Doom, like Skyrim, is one of those games that’ll eventually be ported to everything. Microwaves. Checkouts. Voight-Kampff machines maybe, in the years to come. Right dang today though, you can (almost) play Doom in Notepad, or DOOMpad as its creator Samperson calls it. Catch a glimpse of the ripping and tearing in action by watching the video below.

                              <span>Cultic has really good headshots. I mean, it also has a lot of other things going for it, but it feels rude not to highlight this right at the very top because I think it’s important. Cultic’s headshots are sensational. Enemy noggins pop with a squelchy crack that tickles a very unnerving part of my brain, the resulting blood fountain spraying so high it causes the ceiling to drip with human juice long after your hopeless adversary has slumped to the floor. It’s gross. But. You know. It’s also kind of great.

Yes, DLSS 3 is the real deal. And no, neither of those make the RTX 4090 good value for money, even if it makes a compelling argument for Nvidia&#x27;s latest upscaling tech.

At the time it was swiftly shot down as an obvious joke, and I was shamed, but now the freeware game based on a ten-second joke in a 1997 episode of The Simpsons is out. So who&#x27;s laughing now, eh? Play it for yourself via creator Macaw45&#x27;s itch.

The game puts you in charge of four survivors who’ll be up against the basic demands of continuing to exist, and facing dangerous alien creatures.

Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has waded in to allege that, while there will be some fresh COD in the offing, it’ll be in the form of something like a paid expansion for the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 instead of a full game. A Modern Warfare 2.5, if you will.

Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues. While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

                              <span>Valve has finally revamped its decidedly decrepit Steam mobile app for iOS and Android, introducing a fresh look, a new interface, and a range of new features.


The original version of Valve&#x27;s Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device&#x27;s respective app stores.


It&#x27;s most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there&#x27;s plenty more besides.

                              <span>Torchlight: Infinite - a new free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android, iOS, and PC.


Torchlight, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020&#x27;s Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be a free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3&#x27;s less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

                              <span>FIFA has launched its first video game venture since its split with EA - a vaguely football-themed Roblox &quot;immersive experience&quot; intended to tie-in with this year&#x27;s Qatar world cup.


Following the termination of FIFA&#x27;s partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter&#x27;s long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, &quot;I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.&quot;


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of &quot;non-simulation games&quot; toward the end of this year.

                              <span>Sony has revealed the next round of games to hit its PlayStation Plus subscription service this October for Premium and Extra subscribers.


The headline addition is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the definitive edition version previously remastered for PS4 and PS5. 


But Dragon Quest fans will be happy with five games from the series added to PS Plus: Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age, Dragon Quest Builders and its sequel, Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree&#x27;s Woe and the Blight Below, and Dragon Quest Heroes 2: Explorer&#x27;s Edition.

                              <span>The next generation of graphics performance is finally in our hands - and it&#x27;s one of the biggest generational leaps we&#x27;ve ever seen. Back in the day, comparing RTX 3080 to RTX 2080 showed up some impressive gains - but the performance multipliers are at a new level when considering how the new RTX 4090 stacks up against prior GPU champions RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. In fact, on a broader level, the delivery of so much performance actually poses problems in creating a balanced gaming PC: as you&#x27;ll see in our analysis, many of the games we&#x27;re benching are now hitting CPU limitations. Even at 4K resolution. Even at maximum settings. The heaviest of ray tracing workloads though? RTX 4090 is simply phenomenal.
In fact, the power of the new card actually poses some fundamental questions: if CPUs…</span>

                              <span>Blizzard has announced a series of double XP weekends to &quot;make up for any lost time&quot; following Overwatch 2&#x27;s various launch issues.


&quot;Let&#x27;s try that again,&quot; Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra wrote on Twitter last night, sharing a fresh blog post from the developer which apologises - yet again - for the game&#x27;s troubled arrival and offers a few bits and pieces to cheer fans up.


Overwatch 2 players can look forward to &quot;several Double Match XP weekends&quot; - dates for which will be announced soon. Anyone who logs in this season from 25th October onwards will also get a Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary skin and a Health Pack Weapon Charm, which is nice I guess.

Custom boot videos for the Steam Deck have recently taken off, and Reddit user waylaidwanderer has even gone to the lengths of setting up the website SteamDeckRepo, dedicated to sharing videos for others to use.

Now it looks like Valve is jumping onto the trend, with references to &quot;Steam Deck Startup Movies&quot; found in code for the Points Shop.

                              <span>When I think of Lego today - the toy itself, as well as its many video game versions - it’s easy to get distracted by the decades of licensed properties now immortalised in plastic bricks. I think of building my Lego NES console, or the looming Lord of the Rings Tower of Orthanc which sits next to my telly. In Lego video games, I think of the time I spent roaming round Hogwarts or the Batcave, or the enormous Star Wars galaxy in the recent Skywalker Saga. It’s only after more thought I remember the older models I began with, as a child in the rather distant past. 


That’s not to say those early sets were forgettable! I still have the bricks from those castles I cobbled together, or from the rockets I launched from secret bases built under the coffee table. But when I think of those time…</span>

The series was set to be directed and developed by Seth Kearsley, whose other credits include Eight Crazy Nights and The Looney Tunes Show.

In 2002, the same year as the release of the original Kingdom Hearts game, Kearsley was hired by Disney TV for the series. Although the pilot tested &quot;exceptionally well&quot;, it was canned due to Square Enix&#x27;s future plans for &quot;many more games&quot; in the series.

                              <span>Microsoft has responded to a list of concerns regarding its ongoing $68bn attempt to buy Activision Blizzard, as raised by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and come up with an interesting statistic.


In response to continued questions over whether Microsoft owning Call of Duty would unfairly hobble PlayStation, Microsoft claimed that every COD player on PlayStation could move over to Xbox, and Sony&#x27;s playerbase would still remain &quot;significantly larger&quot; than its own. 


Microsoft does not go into detail on its mental arithmetic here, but does note elswhere in its comments that PlayStation currently has a console install base of 150 million, compared to Xbox&#x27;s install base of 63.7 million.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 doesn&#x27;t really take cyberpsychosis seriously, but a new mod changes that.


Modder DJ_Kovrik has created the Wannabe Edgerunner mod that adds in the Humanity stat.


Essentially, every piece of cyberware has a Humanity Cost that gradually drives your character towards cyberpsychosis.

The Cyberpunk 2077 team lifted the lid on this new project earlier today and, while details on this novel (for now at least) are still fairly thin on the ground, we know that it will be called &quot;No Coincidence&quot;. 
Meanwhile, the story will follow a &quot;group of strangers&quot; doing what they can to negotiate the &quot;dangers of Night City&quot;. Something of which, we all know, there are many.

A new trailer has been released to announce the Early Access launch, which gives a look at how it all plays.

Stripe&#x27;s arrival follows that of fellow Gremlins alum Gizmo. Unlike Gizmo, however, Stripe will wield a chainsaw - you know, for those times when you want to go full Ash Williams. 


Stripe&#x27;s standard look is unlockable with either 2000 Gold, one Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium. If you fancy something a little bit more Rambo-like, you can unlock his Combat Stripe variant with 800 Gleamium.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 battle royale The First Soldier will shut down in January next year.


The game was first released in November 2021, meaning its shelf life was a little over 12 months.


News of its end was announced on Twitter: &quot;Despite all our efforts to bring you regular updates with fresh and exciting content, we haven&#x27;t been able to deliver the experience that we were hoping to, and that you all deserve, so we have made the extremely tough decision to end service for Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier.&quot;

                              <span>Facebook parent company Meta has snaffled up several developers, including ReCore maker Armature Studio, to fold into its own Oculus Studios brand. 


Armature will be joined as part of Meta by LocoCycle and &#x27;Splosion Man developer Twisted Pixel Games, as well as Marvel&#x27;s Iron Man VR company Camouflaj. 


Meta made the acquisition announcements last night as part of its Meta Connect event, where it also confirmed a partnership with Xbox Cloud Gaming to see Microsoft&#x27;s game streaming tech arrive on Quest VR headsets. The new £1500 Quest Pro headset was also given an official unveiling - after an early unit recently turned up in a hotel.

Saints Row released to a middling reception in August, with its enjoyable open-world zaniness rather dampened by its considerable number of bugs. It&#x27;s these that Volition hopes to address in its first major post-launch update in November, explaining in a new blog post, &quot;We know there is still work to do to improve your experience in the game.&quot;


&quot;We are supporting Saints Row for the long-term,&quot; it insisted, &quot;and while we&#x27;d have preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions, right now we feel the focus must be on telling you how we&#x27;re going to improve the... experience for all players in 2022 and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>New Blood Interactive have made a name with various flavours of retro first-person shooter, including Dusk, Amid Evil and Gloomwood. They&#x27;re branching out into nostalgic throwbacks for other genres, however. To mark the 25th anniversary of the orignal Fallout, CEO Dave Oshry showed new footage from their unnamed, unannounced CRPG.

                              <span>Meta have announced their much-teased new VR headset, the Meta Quest Pro. It promises a swankier virtual reality experience over the Meta Quest 2, with higher resolution displays, a lighter headset, and new Quest Touch Pro controllers included. It&#x27;s also launching imminently, on October 25th, with pre-orders open now.

The downside: it&#x27;ll cost you £1500/$1500 versus the Quest 2&#x27;s £400, with Meta saying the headset is designed for business and not gaming.

                              <span>I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee&#x27;s recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as &quot;extremely relevant to [my] interests&quot;. So relevant, in fact, that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this wasn&#x27;t an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn&#x27;t do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it&#x27;s immediately become my favourite thing I&#x27;ve ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I&#x27;ve been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice&#x27;s part. No idea if I&#x27;ve succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

                              <span>I was underwhelmed by Prime Day’s lack of compelling desktop RAM deals, and Amazon’s follow-up – the Prime Early Access Sale – is also pretty quiet for good memory discounts. However, there are some intriguing offers on DDR5 RAM, which is perfect timing: AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs have just launched, and unlike their Intel 13th Gen/Raptor Lake rivals, won’t be compatible with older DDR4 at all.

                              <span>Oh my word, I&#x27;d forgotten about Sharkey&#x27;s 3D Pool. What a grand old game. Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn&#x27;t have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent&#x27;s ball: that was just extraneous detail.

                              <span>Not keen on the snazzy driving effects in recently announced racer Need For Speed Unbound? That’s okay, because devs Criterion Games have confirmed that you don’t have to play the game with great big puffs of colourful smoke dredging up from your car’s wheels, or cartoon wings popping out when you drive up a ramp and get some air. I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

That, and it’s currently a lot cheaper than usual in the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which runs until midnight tomorrow (October 12th).

                              <span>Coral Island  self-describes as a &quot;reimagining of farming games&quot;, but if we&#x27;re being real it doesn&#x27;t reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that&#x27;s what we call ourselves).
That&#x27;s not to say Coral Island isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you&#x27;re doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe&#x27;s smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

Game director Kento Kinoshita told Polygon that although playable Lady D is still taller than any other character in Mercenaries, she’s been shortened to “a little under nine feet tall” from her canon height of around nine feet six inches. Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

Therefore, I’ll be here across the two-day event – that’s October 11th and 12th – keeping track of all the best Prime Early Access deals on PC gaming hardware that I can find.

                              <span>A DDoS attack on Blizzard caused issues for Overwatch 2 players earlier today, following on from similar attacks on the company during the free to play shooter’s launch last week. The latest attack came just after Overwatch 2 had finished a period of emergency maintenance. Although Blizzard have confirmed the DDoS attack has now ended, the recurring attacks aren’t exactly a good sign for a game already beset by technical issues.

                              <span>Rather than launching a new Call of Duty title in 2023, Activision is reportedly planning to instead release a premium expansion including new &quot;campaign content&quot; for Modern Warfare 2.


Word of new paid campaign DLC for Modern Warfare 2 was initially shared by Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who claimed it would arrive in the game&#x27;s second year (ie. 2023) and would be bundled with a 20th anniversary &quot;greatest hits map pack&quot; containing classic maps from the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2, as well as maps from across the series.


Following TheGhostofHope&#x27;s campaign DLC claims, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier stepped in to corroborate the news. &quot;Next year [Activision Blizzard will] be selling new stuff for MW2&quot;, he wrote in a tweet, &quot;an expansion or something like that&quot;. Although Schreier admitted he wasn&#x27;t &quot;sure exactly what it&#x27;ll look like&quot;, he claimed it would have &quot;campaign stuff too&quot;.

Xbox Cloud Gaming gives Game Pass Ultimate subscribers the ability to stream and play a steadily growing number of titles on a range of Android, Apple, and Windows devices, as well as Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox consoles, and eventually, Microsoft&#x27;s dedicated Keystone device. 


And that list, as revealed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during today&#x27;s Meta Connect event, has now grown to include Quest VR head sets.

EA Sports PGA Tour - the publisher&#x27;s first foray into golfing sims since 2015&#x27;s Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March last year, promising to deliver world famous golf courses and professional golfers as part of a long-term deal with the PGA Tour.


One year-long delay later, EA Sports PGA Tour is shuffling ever-closer to release, and EA&#x27;s first major reveal for the game comes in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer.

Along with this announcement, we also have a nice shiny new trailer from Devolver Digital to mark the occasion. This trailer, which you can see below, shows off some of the extreme temple runs that you as the player will have to navigate.  


This &quot;massive asynchronous multiplayer&quot; will throw players into those temples seen above and task them with retrieving ancient relics from within. There will be hidden traps to account for, and, as with all good temple exploration, there will of course be guardians that will do everything in their power to stop players from reaching their goal.

A new gameplay video shared on Twitter shows the customisation options, urging players to &quot;get noticed&quot;.


It&#x27;s all part of the game&#x27;s visual style that marries realistic vehicles with colourful, animated street art.

                              <span>Are standard Xbox controllers a little too ordinary for your tastes? Then perhaps Microsoft&#x27;s has the answer with its newly revealed - and purportedly &quot;surreal&quot; - Lunar Shift special edition affair.


In what way, you might reasonably be wondering,  is the Lunar Shift Special Edition Wireless Controller &quot;surreal&quot;? Is it perhaps formed from the whisper of a backward-speaking entity in a red-curtain-clad room? Does it droop provocatively across surfaces like a slowly melting pocket watch? Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?


Alas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift&#x27;s big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year&#x27;s Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light. This, says, Microsoft, gives it a &quot;stylised, smokey atmosphere&quot;.

                              <span>Shipments of PS5 consoles to the US in September had a 400 percent increase year-over-year, according to a financial analyst.

David Gibson, senior analyst at MST Financial, shared a graph on Twitter showing the imports to the US per month from June 2021 onwards, with a huge spike during last month.

Gibson added he believes some of the stock will go towards the launch of God of War Ragnarök, which makes a lot of sense. Ragnarök is the next first-party title for PlayStation, and Sony will be undoubtedly eager to capitalise on its release to bolster sales of the PS5.

                              <span>There have been some rumblings that Sony, along with developer Naughty Dog, decided to release its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) to monopolise on the upcoming HBO series inspired by the game.
However, PlayStation head Hermen Hulst has made it known that this is not the case. Well, at least, it is not entirely the case.
Chatting to Axios, Hulst stated that the initial 2013 release of The Last of Us was &quot;a little ahead of its time in terms of its creative vision&quot;. Hulst claimed that the limitations of technology at this time meant that Naughty Dog&#x27;s ideas ultimately had to be dialled back a notch or two.

                              <span>I recently discovered that I am towards the micromanagement end of the scale when it comes to Football Manager. Or maybe more accurately, off the end of that scale, a spec in the distance visible only with the kind of magnifying glass I use to inspect my player&#x27;s daily training habits. I&#x27;m the one you hear about with the spreadsheets and the 100 percent press conference attendance record, and while I have no shame at all, it has always made me a bit sceptical of FM&#x27;s portable modes, the recent Xbox versions included.


Having played it for a good few hours of it up at developer Sports Interactive&#x27;s studios, however, the new PS5 version of FM23 goes a good way towards putting me at ease. There are a few versions here, so for clarity a quick whip-round: Football Manager is the fullest version, which you can only play on PC; FM Mobile is the lightest version designed for playing on commutes and sun loungers, with a heavily trimmed-back set of features and systems; FM Touch is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Mobile, designed for the Switch; FM Xbox was brought in more recently and is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Touch, but still a long way off from full-fat Football Manager. 


This year, with the arrival of the PS5 version, things have been rejigged a little. The Xbox version is gone, and there&#x27;s now FM Console, which is the same across PS5 and Xbox (but Switch is still Touch). FM Console is definitely lighter than the full version, but also far, far closer to it than ever before. In brief, it feels like the main, PC Football Manager game was the starting point here, with things tweaked to fit into a console-style user experience, as opposed to being built from the Mobile version outwards.

Now, following the discovery of this jailbreaking exploit, McDonald has been rifling around in the files for both BluePoint&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Souls remake and those of the elusive Abandoned from developer Blue Box Game Studio.

When having a closer look at those files for Demon&#x27;s Souls, McDonald came across a rather endearing and fun inclusion by developer BluePoint Games. It turns out that there are 3D model files for the one and only &#x27;Ring of the Chieftain&#x27; tucked away in the PS5 remake.

                              <span>The embargo lifts today on Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce RTX 4090 and it&#x27;s a phenomenal achievement in graphics performance - as you might hope and expect from a $1600/£1650 GPU. The full Eurogamer review will follow as soon as possible but so much work in Digital Foundry has been poured into this project that we&#x27;ve only just managed to finish the video review in time. With minutes left until the embargo lifts, I wanted to share the review with the Eurogamer audience - and to offer up some personal thoughts on the product.
First of all, I think it is important to stress that the power level of this product shows a leap in performance that surrounding components within a gaming PC may struggle to fully access. 1080p and 1440p metrics with this product are essentially meaningless - even with my Core i9 12900K overclocked to 5.2GHz on all performance cores, I&#x27;m finding frame-rates hitting the CPU limit. This happens even on some 4K benchmarks without ray tracing in the equation. And even if you are using RT, opting for DLSS performance mode (with an internal 1080p base image) can again see you hitting the limits of your processor.
Over the last few weeks, it&#x27;s been really interesting just to &#x27;live&#x27; with the card for PC gaming - I use a 4K 120Hz LG OLED CX display, and it&#x27;s a good fit for the RTX 4090. I don&#x27;t need to worry about settings, I don&#x27;t need to worry about performance. I&#x27;d venture to suggest that for non-RT gaming, the graphics problem is &#x27;solved&#x27;. Ray tracing? No worries there either, thanks to DLSS. However, if I did not have a 4K 120Hz display, I do wonder whether I&#x27;d need the 4090. That&#x27;s my subjective opinion on gaming with the card, but here&#x27;s the full video review where you get all the numbers you need.

                              <span>Oh, it&#x27;s a challenge to describe Evercore Heroes. A pleasant challenge. The name doesn&#x27;t tell you very much. The team, which contains a number of people who worked on League of Legends, describes it as &quot;competitive PvE&quot;. My own notes from a recent online presentation suggest it&#x27;s a WoW raid mixed with a bit of Puyo Tetris. Having had the time to think about it, though, I suspect the whole thing is like one of those fancy cocktails where the different elements separate and form a rainbow strata: Evercore Heroes is simple at first, then complicated, and then ultimately pretty simple again. And hopefully delicious.


Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;d start. You jump into a team of four heroes, all working through a sort of raid area. You&#x27;re fighting mobs in order to get more powerful, because at the end of …</span>

But in order to accomodate her stature, the development team had to make a small compromise on her height.

                              <span>Following Overwatch 2&#x27;s fairly shambolic release that involved targeted DDoS attacks, Blizzard has reported interruptions this week to Battle.net via a further DDOS attack, causing login issues. 


In addition, Overwatch 2&#x27;s character roster has had to be downsized a tad to allow Blizzard to &quot;iron out a few bugs&quot;. Unfortunately for the developer, however, this has created a new bug of its own, resulting in even more characters becoming inaccessible for some Overwatch 2 players.


On the official customer support Twitter account, Blizzard addressed the DDoS attack faced by Battle.net yesterday. This has reportedly now all been dealt with, however it managed to cause widespread issues for players of both Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

                              <span>Following a data breach last month, 2K has now confirmed that some personal data has been recorded.


Hackers were able to gain access to the company&#x27;s support desk, impersonating official communication.


The publisher is now emailing those affected, confirming that some personal data was recorded but there&#x27;s &quot;no indication&quot; that financial information has been compromised.

                              <span>Alice Ruppert has been speaking out about how horses are represented in games ever since Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3. She&#x27;d had such high hopes for it after Red Dead Redemption 1, a game and series she really rates. But when AC3 came along and horses were nothing more than disposable taxis you could pick up at every outpost, she was sorely disappointed. The game didn&#x27;t even save your horse choice through loading screens. She&#x27;s been speaking out about horses in games ever since.
She does it on the wonderfully named website The Mane Quest, where her in-depth reviews - she records horse movement and analyses it frame by frame - have earnt her a loyal following. Her work, and her background in game design, eventually even got her a job making a horse game called  Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is out really soon on PC and Switch.
So how bad are horses in games today? Read on, dear reader. I&#x27;ll deal with a few famous games before broadening into more general mistakes, and what they can do about them. All of this is taken from my podcast interview with Alice Ruppert, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts (look for &quot;Eurogamer Podcasts&quot;).

                              <span>Square Enix Montréal - the developer behind the likes of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go - has rebranded as Studio Onoma following its acquisition by Embracer Group in May.


Square Enix Montréal was one of three studios purchased by Embracer Group as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix earlier this year. Following the deal&#x27;s completion in August, Embracer now also owns Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal, alongside major IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain.


While Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal will keep their existing identities following the Embracer acquisition, Square Enix Montréal has now shaken off the last remnants of its former owner with a new name and new logo, both of which have been detailed in a lengthy post on the developer&#x27;s website. The key takeway for the curious, though, is that &quot;Onoma is Greek for name and names offer endless possibilities&quot;.

But out today is now VirtualBox 7.0 with big features like support for full virtual machine encryption and a new Direct3D 11 based graphics stack, which for Linux use is now going through DXVK...</span>

When Xbox Cloud Gaming launches on the Meta Quest Store, you will be able to use your Xbox controller when hooked up to the Meta headset to play games from your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate library (thanks, Wario64).
While there is no date yet, Microsoft said it will share more on this &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;

According to the official Need for Speed Unbound Twitter account, while you can choose your driving effects, you can also choose never to turn them on in the first place.
While with Unbound you can still race around in hyper-realistic cars, you can also turn your experience into an art form with self-expression. This comes in the form of being able to &quot;tag the world&quot; when deploying your boosting powers. Tags are earned through actions such as drifting, jumps, and near misses.

While looking over a tweet from the executive showing off shelves of items, on the very top shelf there&#x27;s a small white box that looks similar to a mini-Xbox. Even the power button looks similar.
This has led many to believe the small box is the streaming device Microsoft has in the works under the codename &quot;Keystone&quot;.

                              <span>Back in June, we learned that Overwatch 2 would be ditching its controversial loot boxes. The industry celebrated, and why not? Various countries around the world have decreed that loot boxes equate to gambling, with the UK government demanding publishers put measures in place that safeguard children from the adverse effects of them. 18 European countries have also backed measures calling for loot box regulation.

For Overwatch – one of the biggest games that popularised the use of loot boxes in the first place – to renege and opt for the battle pass (as seen in Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Fortnite, and many others besides)... that’s a big move. Seismic. It had the potential to rewrite the rule book, set a precedent for responsible and engaging progression whilst still monetizing the game. Because that, essentially, is what this is all about. Instead, though, the battle pass implementation has been one of the worst I’ve seen in a game for a long time – possibly ever. 

Let’s set the scene. Overwatch is dead. There’s no going back to the original game, now; it is offline, supplanted and replaced wholly by Overwatch 2. The way you used to earn cosmetics and goods for your various heroes – by opening loot boxes and getting randomised rewards – has been replaced with two tracks of a battle pass (one paid, one free).

That&#x27;s according to various Twitter users (thanks, Windows Central) who noticed a new play button was available next to a game when entered into the Bing search bar.
Once you hit the play button, just sign in and start playing the game. This option only seems to work with Microsoft Edge and not with Chrome.

                              <span>Are you tired of fighting tooth and nail for a PS5? Wouldn’t you like to leave the fist fights and public brawls behind in favour of a more adult, more refined gaming experience? Well BMW, of all companies, may be your answer brave wanderer. Starting next year, owners of these fancy, expensive cars will be able to play a variety of games from inside their shiny rides. Hopefully not while driving… Unless you wanna take your gamer credentials to a whole other, almost certainly illegal, level.
This doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to plug a Dualsense or Xbox pad into your car. No, instead the new gaming collection will be played via a connected Smartphone and the in-built Curved Display. The official press release states that the partnership between the BMW Group and Airconsole (who is responsible for the phones-as-gamepads tech used) will “bring casual gaming into new BMW vehicles”. So Mythic WoW Raiders, Warzone demons, and Rocket League zoomers may not be the target audience here. 
Looking at the AirConsole website, it’s clear this is the responsible family’s gaming option. Titles like Brawlanders, Golfriends, Monkey Business and almost 180 more titles clearly appeal to a younger crowd who’d otherwise be causing havoc in the back seats. However, Drunk Casino is the clear winner for me, and sounds like the perfect title for me while I’m headed to work. If I owned a BMW, or a car, or could drive.

In this collaboration, a pack with the Monster Hunter series will be available through a free download on November 15, a few days after Sonic Frontiers releases.
If you download the pack, you will get the special Rathalos armor and a mini game where you grill meat on a spit. If you play the mini-game in-game, it will make Sonic stronger.

                              <span>It’s felt like DLSS has been in the process of becoming an irreplaceable tentpole feature of graphical video game presentation for a while now. As more games adopt the feature and its similar equivalents from other companies, it becomes ever harder to justify turning it off – and with some tasty demos for its latest iteration, Nvidia appears to be truly upping the ante. 
DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, and it’s a clever AI-assisted feature that essentially allows you to get higher frame rates in games without having to sacrifice their visual fidelity. A game that might only run at 30 frames per second in regular settings could previously often be cranked up to over 60fps with DLSS enabled – and with DLSS 3.0, Nvidia aims to crank the gains up even further.
The way DLSS works is pretty simple. AI models are trained on the visuals of games, meaning that the AI can effectively upscale a game with such accuracy in its fidelity that it’s near-enough indistinguishable from the game natively running at a much higher resolution. Running at a lower initial resolution is helpful for settings, however, allowing you to crank up all those delicious PC gaming graphics toggles to max – including ray tracing, the transformative lighting feature that also has a habit of tanking frame rates.

                              <span>Evercore Heroes — a new game coming from Vela Games with former EA and Riot Veterans behind the wheel — has just been announced! The Dublin-based studio’s premier title, the game combines real-time skill focused gameplay found in MOBAs, with the cooperative teamplay required in MMO dungeon runs in what could be a unique twist on a popular genre.
The game is set in a science x fantasy world called Lumerea, where a range of diverse and unique heroes can be found and of course played around with. This includes characters like the shadowy assassin Shade, the steadfast tanky defender Fyn, and Shining archer Zari among others. As you may expect, each hero has their own skills, abilities and strengths.
“Our goal has always been to make the game players really want, even if it means breaking the mould,” said Vela Games CEO and Co-Founder, Travis George. “With EVERCORE Heroes, we are building a unique multiplayer experience that brings together skill-based co-op and competitive play in a fresh new way. And after over two years of great feedback from early testing, we’re ecstatic to finally share the game with the world.&quot;

                              <span>Overwatch 2 has been out for a decent amount of time now, enough of a stretch for the vast number of players to hopefully get through the login queues and try the hero shooter out for themselves. While the gameplay changes (or lack thereof) remain a hot button topic right now among the community, it’s the new battle pass system that really has people riled up, with some even looking back at the loot boxes of Overwatch 1 with newfound fondness.
But what exactly is this new system and why has it got people mad. Well, Overwatch 2 has replaced the old method of unlocking new content — a combination of free and premium loot boxes that contained skins — with a traditional battle pass that has become all the rage over the past few years. This pass contains skins, sprays, voice lines and yes, even new heroes…
Let’s start with that final point, a real rough spot for some among the Overwatch 2 player base. If you buy the premium pass right now, you get the newest character (Kiriko) right away. Bam! However, if you stick to the free pass, you’ll need to progress through 55 levels of the system before you can play the featured hero. Considering Overwatch is an FPS focused around counterpicks and team composition, this isn’t too great for those who want to dive straight into competitive matches. Not to mention, new characters previously were given out for free.

                              <span>Lego Bricktales is the sort of game that would’ve been seismic to me as a child. Lego obsessed from the moment I held my first set, I’ve nevertheless felt that Lego video games have more often than not deliberately dodged or accidentally avoided the freedom of expression and creativity that these magical little bricks allow in the real world. When a game embraces that angle, it’s often gold, as was the case for many of the classic Lego games of the nineties. In Lego Bricktales, we finally have another such game – and it’s brilliant.

Bricktales is a clever, casual, and devilishly challenging experience. It’s a low-key genre mash-up bringing together puzzle-solving curios with light adventure and exploration elements. Rather than a franchise tie-in action game where the Lego aesthetic is… well, an aesthetic, here it’s at the heart of the experience: this is a game about building.

Bricktales essentially takes place inside small dioramas, many of which are based on classic Lego themes like Pirates, Castles, and Theme Parks. Your protagonist travels through this world with a superpower: the ability to build. Your job is to travel through each of the game’s stages by building items and structures that’ll help solve puzzles and open up new areas. Along the way, you’ll also acquire a few non-building abilities and tackle some light traversal puzzles.

With their release, many of us will be headed back to Village once more to see what Rose Winters is capable of in the Shadows of Rose DLC, or to go and fight hordes in Mercenaries.
In an interview with Polygon, game director Kento Kinoshita had plenty to say about Mercenaries, including exactly what it might feel like finally playing as every Resident Evil fan&#x27;s favourite vampire, Lady Dimitrescu.
Mercenaries will feature the playable debut of both Lady D and Karl Heisenberg, and when asked about adapting new characters for the game mode, Kinoshita shared, “When adapting them for The Mercenaries, we made a conscious effort to give each one their own distinct feel. Chris is a hybrid character that combines long-range attacks (firearms) with close-combat (fists). Meanwhile, Heisenberg wields magnetic force to unleash close-range assaults.”

Unfortunately, DICE had to disable The Liquidators very shortly after it went live.
DICE broke the news on Twitter upon discovering major two major issues with the event. Players were not able to make progress or unlock event rewards, effectively invalidating their progress. The other bug doubles down by preventing players from being able to equip what they unlocked.

                              <span>If I remember correctly, Action Man: Raid On Island X dropped out of a cereal box. This was back when cereal had that Happy Meal generosity, and you&#x27;d look forward to that thump as a gift caked in dust landed in your bowl. You won&#x27;t find any game demos in those wheat crunchie crumbs anymore.
Definitely not one on the level of Action Man: Raid On Island X at least. It was the absolute business.

Well, now Activision Blizzard are planning to insist people sign up for two-factor authentication to play the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, too. They’re also warning that players with pre-paid plans might not be able to get the process to work.

I was lucky enough to go hands-on with an early build of the Wild Hearts&#x27;s opening hours to see how it stacks up against its age-old competitor, and whether it has any chance of melting down Monster Hunter&#x27;s trophy cabinet and forging itself a golden crown.

                              <span>Owners of Valve’s handheld PC Steam Deck have been fiddling about with creating and sharing their own ten-second animations for the machine’s new custom boot video feature, implemented in a client update last week. Some pay homage to Valve and Steam, while others nod towards games in general, or even classic telly and film. I’ve had a rummage around to help give you some ideas, and found the batch below.

Although there’s nothing more than that, and Nightdive haven’t announced anything themselves, it’s a step forward for the game.

                              <span>Phil Spencer&#x27;s shelf is at it again. Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft&#x27;s long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.


Spencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, &quot;Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary.&quot; Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that&#x27;s supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.


As described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was &#x27;pivoting away&#x27; from the then-current iteration to refocus on &quot;a new approach&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch has responded to its controversial decision not to amend its revenue split for streamers.


At present, that split is 50/50 between Twitch and streamers, unlike key competition like YouTube that favours streamers with a 70/30 split. In a lengthy blog post last month, Twitch explained why it won&#x27;t be amending this.



Then, at TwitchCon San Diego during the Patch Notes livestream, Twitch addressed the issue once again.

Players were also able to use the in-game character creation to make a custom fighter for the closed beta and so, unsurprisingly, people decided to experiment and see how far they could push those polygons.

And boy, did you all push them.

                              <span>Do we really need a Horizon Zero Dawn remake? That was the first topic on this week&#x27;s Digital Foundry Direct, as John, Rich and Alex grapple with the prospect of a PS5 remaster of a recently-released PlayStation 4 title. 
It&#x27;s a hard question to answer, as undoubtedly the team at Guerrilla Games wants their work to be playable at the best possible quality, but the 2017 PS4 release already runs well on PS5 thanks to a patch - and the PC edition from 2020 remains one of the best-looking games on the platform two years later. Creating a remake could be a good way for the developers to work on a PS5-only engine for future titles but that same development time could also be devoted to an entirely new Horizon game, albeit one that won&#x27;t result in an influx of cash for the company quite as soon. 
It&#x27;s an interesting point of discussion, and the rest of the spreadsheet that spawned the Horizon Zero Dawn remake rumour also makes for entertaining reading. There&#x27;s mention of a Horizon multiplayer &#x27;live service&#x27; game for PS5 and PC and a new Death Stranding, for example.

Quantic Lab came under scruntiny in June when a YouTube video uploaded by channel Upper Echelon Gamers contained details of mismanagement and malpractice at the company while it was helping with development on Cyberpunk 2077. 

The allegations, shared with Upper Echelon Gamers by whistleblowers, were brushed off by Quantic Lab CEO and founder Stefan Seicarescu at the time.

If you head on over to the phone notifications page on the Battle.net support site, you will see the text stating that those playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, or those with &quot;newly created Overwatch 2 accounts, and newly created Call of Duty: Modern Warfare accounts&quot;, will be  required to add a phone number to access the game. 


The page continues: &quot;Adding a phone number will allow Blizzard Entertainment to send you notifications when important changes are made to your account. Any mobile phone in a supported country with a data plan, and that is not prepaid or a VOIP number, can be used with this service&quot; (thanks, PCGamer).

You may remember the game from a year ago when it first appeared on the Steam store. 

Developer Two Star Games announced the release date for Choo-Choo Charles over the weekend, with an accompanying trailer.

The stand, a collaboration between Lenovo and Intel, consisted of a Gladiators-style battle over a foam pit.


However, several streamers were seriously injured at the stand, including Adriana Chechik who confirmed on Twitter she&#x27;ll be having surgery to recover.

                              <span>Hey, did I ever mention that I got to play on the PSVR 2 recently? Because I did and I actually had a wonderful time playing demos of four upcoming PSVR2 games on Sony&#x27;s new  VR headset. Inspired by that preview session, on this week&#x27;s episode of VR Corner (above), I decided to dig into the ever-growing list of confirmed PSVR 2 titles and whittle it down to the 13 games I&#x27;m most excited to play. Fair warning, as this is my opinion only and it&#x27;s my favourite VR genre, there are a lot of shooters in there so shout outs to the runners up, Demeo and Ultrawings 2 that just missed out on making the cut for this list.
Firewall Ultra
So far details are light on what Firewall Ultra, the PSVR 2 exclusive follow up to Firewall Zero Hour has to offer in terms of new gameplay. However, the original was one of my all-time favourite PSVR titles and this tactical shooter delivered some superb Rainbow Six Siege style gameplay that just felt phenomenal to experience in VR. The sneak peeks of gampelay we’ve been shown in recent trailers have sent my anticipation levels into overdrive though. Not only are we bound to see much better visuals this time around, thanks to the PSVR2’s 4K HDR but (according to a splash screen at the end of the Firewall Ultra reveal trailer) the game will also take advantage of all the PSVR2’s new hardware features such as finger touch detection, foveated rendering, adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. Which means you’re actually going to feel it the next time you get shot in the head by the opposition!

                              <span>Why do people play healers in games? Where does that drive come from for someone to log in and want to help someone else instead of seeking glory of their own?


I&#x27;ve wondered about it ever since I started healing in Dark Age of Camelot 20 years ago. I don&#x27;t know why I did it or stuck with it, but in every game I play now, I gravitate towards that role. 


And having played healers for so long, I&#x27;ve seen the good and the bad of it. I&#x27;ve been moaned at, and I&#x27;ve been killed as a matter of priority by enemy teams more times than I can count. And let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s not always fun - not just for those reasons, but because healing isn&#x27;t the flashy stuff games are sold on.

                              <span>Good news everyone! You can now link together your Steam and PSN accounts. In case you’re not shaking in your boots, screaming and soiling yourself in hype, this means you can claim some super rad free stuff on PC versions of certain PlayStation titles. Snark and sarcasm aside, this marks the latest step in Sony’s invasion of the PC platform.
You want an example of some of the perks? How about Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles Morales buddy? If you link together your Steam and PSN accounts, you can claim some cosmetics and in-game bonuses including the Resilient Suit, and early unlock of the Concussive Blast, and two skills points. 
But what else does this mean, aside from Miles Morales players getting a nice little boost if they decide to pick up the game on the PC right now. Well, as briefly mentioned earlier, it’s a rather major milestone in Sony’s slow but steady trudge onto the platform. We’ve seen it make pushes here and there with services like PlayStation Now allowing you to play games like Bloodborne on PC for a while now, but this newfound connectivity adds some extra justification for porting over Sony’s biggest titles to the platform.

                              <span>Spooky season is upon us. The nights are drawing in, the smell of leaf mulch is in the air, and the clouds are stretching out across the sky, getting thinner and wider and seemingly further away – it all looks as if the barriers between the worlds are fading. 
It&#x27;s the perfect time, then, to stay indoors; watch the long autumn evenings drip into night from the safety of your sofa, where you&#x27;re all wrapped up with a mug of tea and your favourite spooky game. Maybe you&#x27;ll turn to an old classic – Resident Evil or Dead Space – and by the time you look outside again, there&#x27;s only the pale light of a harvest moon, illuminating the dead streets and frigid pavements of your road.
Perhaps you don&#x27;t want to get back into a classic, though – you&#x27;ve played through SOMA one too many times, maybe, and Alien: Isolation just isn&#x27;t cutting it for you anymore. So we&#x27;re here to help.

                              <span>^We&#x27;ve re-dubbed the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer with Charles Martinet&#x27;s voice work in order to give you a taste of what might have been. Stick around after the ads to hear the surprising results.


Many fans are outraged by the fact that the original voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, will not be bringing his classic take on the character to the silver screen. Instead, he&#x27;s been replaced by Hollywood superstar Chris Pratt, a move which many have dismissed as stunt casting, on the grounds that Chris Pratt isn&#x27;t Italian and famously doesn&#x27;t even like cured meats.

While Charles Martinet isn&#x27;t a Hollywood name (ask one of your normal mates about him and expect blank stares before a suggestion that he&#x27;s a footballer or something), he&#x27;s far from just the &quot;voice of Mario.&quot; He&#x27;s got quite a few voices, actually.

                              <span>In a recent interview with PCGamer, Nate Purkeypile gave many of us an insight into Bethesda’s upcoming RPG, Starfield. Nate has been a developer for 17 years, with 14 of those years being spent at Bethesda working on the likes of Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. 
Now, Nate is the founder of Just Purkey Games, spending time on smaller projects. While he, for rather obvious reasons, couldn’t share too much about Starfield, Nate did have some interesting things to say when it comes to working with Bethesda on Starfield.
When asked about just how big Starfield really is, it became clear that Starfield isn’t just a huge game, it has an even larger team behind it, too. “Starfield is a much bigger project, it’s like 500 people or something on the team, whereas I think [Fallout] 76 was maybe 200, tops,” said Nate.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players are coming under fire a tad more than usual right now, thanks to a bug that allows Bastion to infinitely shoot their ultimate until their ultimate timer runs out. While you’re usually only able to use it three times before you’re kicked out, this glitch allows Bastion mains in the know to unload shot after shot for up to eight seconds — more than enough time to clear out an objective or kill most of a team.
What’s worse is that it’s easily reproducible. To fire off a shot, you can use one of two inputs. The trick is to use your left click / right trigger for the first two shots, before pressing both inputs at the same time for each consecutive shot afterwards. On PC this means using left click and Q at the same time, although some have been rebinding their left click input to other keys to make the bug that much easier to reproduce.
The result? An otherwise underwhelming ultimate for a typical subpar Overwatch hero is currently causing havoc online. Regardless of your hero or what role you’re filling, an endless stream of high-damage shells is enough to wipe out anyone, and while eight seconds might not sound like a lot, it’s more than enough time to blow through the vast majority of the enemy team.

                              <span>This might sound like an unlikely crossover, but based on a recent leak, real life footballers might make an appearance in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.


As spotted by Insider Gaming, notable Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope recently shared a list of unreleased operators for Modern Warfare 2. Call of Duty leaks are a dime a dozen, but this one lists big name footballers like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and more as potential operators. TheGhostOfHope wasn&#x27;t able to elaborate on the leak, noting that they don&#x27;t have &quot;a clue why&quot; it&#x27;s a list of football player names.


The names could just be temporary placeholders, so there&#x27;s no guarantee that these footballers will be seen running and gunning around the place, though it would be an odd choice for some file names. Call of Duty isn&#x27;t exactly a stranger to odd collaborations, like when the series featured Godzilla and King Kong, or the Attack on Titan cosmetic pack.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no specific date just yet, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be coming out this year any more, but the System Shock remake might finally be out next year.


This spot comes courtesy of deals wizard and news poster Wario64, who noticed that the Steam page for the System Shock remake appears to have been updated to say March 2023 (thanks, Eurogamer). An official announcement regarding a release date hasn&#x27;t been confirmed as of yet, but up until this point the game was expected to release sometime this year. Though considering how much of the year is left, a push to next year isn&#x27;t all that surprising.


Being developed by Nightdive Studios, the System Shock remake was born as a Kickstarter project way back in 2016, with an initial expected release date of 2017. That obviously never happened, with the game receiving numerous delays over the years, bringing us to now where it&#x27;s more of a &#x27;it&#x27;ll come out when it comes out&#x27; situation.

                              <span>MutliVersus game director, Tony Huynh, has made a habit of teasing or outright announcing future changes to the game via social media, a practice that has frankly established a strong link between the development team and the community over the past few months since launch. However, a recent Tweet has sent the community spiralling. Some, seemingly overjoyed! Others, very worried.
This change is a hard limit to the number of times you can use the same move in a combo, an effort to clamp down on “infinites”. These refer to combos that can — in theory — go on forever, unless the opposing player falls away from the blows or the attacking player suffers from a moment of input error. While current anti-infinite systems are in place, which drastically lowers the damage of repeated moves in the same combo, a hard combo breaker would drastically affect the ability to perform extended attack strings.
So, first things first, who does this affect the most? Well, certain characters have had long winded combos that use repeated moves  — and yes, even infinites — for some time now. Harley Quinn and Superman are the most prevalent, able to combo players from spawn to ludicrously high percentages and even straight up kills.

Moving on quickly from the bad pun, the Kickstarter for Zoo Tycoon: The Board Game is launching later this month, with a planned release of next year, being described as &quot;Your zoo in a box with more than 230 Animal Meeples. A highly thematic board game experience for 2-4 players&quot; (thanks Eurogamer). 


Like the video game, the board game will have you building &quot;a zoo that focuses on marquee animals like Lions, Gorillas, or Elephants to attract and thrill guests,&quot; as explained by publisher Treecer. &quot;Or develop partnerships with National Parks on conservation and reintroduce endangered species back into the wild.

If I had a nickel for every weird place you&#x27;re able to play Doom, I&#x27;d probably have quite a few nickels, because people just seem incredibly determined to get it to run on anything they can get their hands on. Today, this particular nickel of mine comes from developer Samperson, who got Doom running on the note taking software Notepad (slight flashing warning in the example video seen below).


While it&#x27;s definitely one of the more unreadable versions of Doom, you have to admit when watching the video, this is in fact Doom. The game itself is obviously made up of a bunch of various characters lined up to resemble the visuals of Doom. It even sounds like Samperson got the audio and soundtrack working and synced up, which could not be anything but witchcraft.

                              <span>International regulators around the world are pouring over the finer details of the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger, and some of the information coming out of the enquries are fascinating. The most recent – and revealing – byte of data comes via TweakTown, and from Brazil&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), which has managed to finally shed some light on how much money Xbox Game Pass actually makes for Microsoft.
Per data shared with CADE, Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021 (not including Xbox Game Pass for PC). This is the first time we&#x27;ve seen data like this, and it sheds a light on how important the service is for Microsoft. 
Elsewhere, there&#x27;s more interesting data coming out of CADE – like the revelation that Xbox gaming generated an eye-watering total revenue of $16.28 billion for Microsoft in the 2021 calendar year.

                              <span>Debian does not officially support upgrading from earlier than the previous stable release: you’re not supposed to “skip” releases. Instead, you’re supposed to upgrade to each intervening major release in turn.
However, skipping intervening releases does, in fact, often work quite well. Apparently, this is surprising to many people, even Debian insiders. I was encouraged to write about it some more.
My personal experience
I have three conventionally-managed personal server systems (by which I mean systems which aren’t reprovisioned by some kind of automation). Of these at least two have been skip upgraded at least once:
The one I don’t think I’ve skip-upgraded (at least, not recently) is my house network manager (and now VM host) which I try to keep to a minimum in terms of functionality a…</span>

                              <span>I’m on the train back from MuniHac, where I gave a talk about the rec-def library that I have excessively blogged about recently (here, here, here and here). I got quite flattering comments about that talk, so if you want to see if they were sincere, I suggest you watch the recording of “Getting recursive definitions off their bottoms” (but it’s not necessary for the following).
After the talk, Franz Thoma approached me and told me a story of how we was once implementing the game Minesweeper in Haskell, and in particular the part of the logic where, after the user has uncovered a field, the game would automatically uncover all fields that are next to a “neutral” field, i.e. one with zero adjacent bombs. He was using a comonadic data structure, which makes a “context-dependent parallel comp…</span>

                              <span>LaTeX — the age-old typesetting system — makes me angry. Not because it&#x27;s bad.
To clarify, not because there&#x27;s something better. But because there should
be.
When writing a document using LaTeX, if you are prone to procrastination
it can be very difficult to focus on the task at hand, because there are so
many yaks to shave. Here&#x27;s a few points of advice.
format the document source for legible reading. Yes, it&#x27;s the input
to the typesetter, and yes, the output of the typesetter needs to be
legible. But it&#x27;s worth making the input easy to read, too. Because…


avoid rebuilding your rendered document too often. It&#x27;s slow, it takes you
out of the activity of writing, and it throws up lots of opportunities to
get distracted by some rendering nit that you didn&#x27;t realise would happen.

I’ve used different variations of this setup for a long time with
VirtualBox and KVM for
the Virtual Machines and Linux-VServer,
OpenVZ, LXC and lately
Docker or Podman for the
Containers.
Required packages
I’m running Debian Sid with systemd and network-manager to configure the
WiFi and Ethernet interfaces, but for the bridge I use bridge-utils with
ifupdown (as I said this setup is old, I guess ifupdow2 and ifupdown-ng
will work too).
To start and stop the DNS and DHCP services and add NAT rules when the
bridge is brought up or down I execute a script that uses:

                              <span>Following the first trailer for the Super Mario Bros Movie, prolific voice actress Tara Strong has criticised the casting of the titular plumber.


To pretty much everyone&#x27;s horror, last year it was revealed that Chris Pratt would play Mario in Illumination&#x27;s adaptation of the beloved series. In one part, fans were unhappy that an actor that has been associated with a controversial church (which he later noted was not a church he attends, but in fact a different one that also isn&#x27;t great). But fans were also unhappy that Mario himself, Charles Martinet, would not be reprising his role. Like fans of the actor, fellow voice actress Tara Strong also doesn&#x27;t seem to be happy.


Strong, known for a huge number of roles, notably including multiple stints as Harley Quinn, and Fairly Odd Parent&#x27;s Timmy Turner, shared a photo of herself and Martinet with a caption that reads, &quot;It should be Charles,&quot; obviously in references to the recent release of the first trailer of the film.

                              <span>While it&#x27;s not a new video game announcement, Atlus has announced that Persona 5 Royal is getting a card game adaptation. 


The new card game based on Persona 5 Royal very specifically is being designed by Emerson Matsuuchi, and is being published by Pandasauras Games, announced on the publisher&#x27;s site. According to Matsuuchi, &quot;Players will take on the roles of their favorite Phantom Thieves and fight to change the world in this cooperative card-based strategy game,&quot; though other than that no other details were provided on what the game will actually be like.


Nathan McNair, co-owner of Pandasaura Games, also said, As a diehard fan of Persona 5 Royal – I cannot wait to bring the Palaces, Velvet Room and world of Persona 5 Royal onto tabletops everywhere in 2023.&quot; The game is apparently targeting a Q4 2023 release, which is anywhere between October and December, though oddly an image on the site does specify an October 21 release date, so it could be then, it could be later.

                              <span>After some speculation from fans, Deathloop director Dinga Bakaba confirmed that the game is in fact set in the same world as Dishonored.

Arkane&#x27;s games all tend to have some similarities here and there, being one of the few big developers to actually make immersive simulators, but Deathloop and Dishonored obviously shared some DNA in more obvious ways. But according to Deathloop&#x27;s director himself, the games are both in fact in the same world, something likely to please fans that have theorised as such.


Bakaba confirmed the connection on the most recent episode of the Xbox Podcast (thanks PCGamer), where he said that Deathloop is &quot;one of the futures of the Dishonored world.&quot; Asked directly about the connection, Bakaba noted how due to the nature of the game not everyone will see the same thing, &quot;so it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after Death of the Outsider.&quot;

                              <span>If you have a penchant for uncovered, orb-shaped body parts, Nintendo isn&#x27;t going to be in your good books.


Nintendo obviously has a pretty family-friendly image for the most part, so you&#x27;re unlikely to find scenes of a sexual nature in a Mario game. However, with the Nintendo Switch, some more risque games have made it onto the platform. According to one indie developer though, outright &quot;uncensored nudes,&quot; won&#x27;t be allowed on the eShop.


Publisher Gamuzumi recently confirmed that one of the games it&#x27;s publishing, Hot Tentacles Shoot, would not be coming to Switch for the time being (thanks, Nintendo Everything). According to Gamuzumi, the reason for the game not being allowed on the eShop is that &quot;obscene content could damage the brand and infringe its policies.&quot;

                              <span>It’s difficult to believe, but today marks ten years since XCOM: Enemy Unknown was first released. A lot has changed in the world of gaming in the ensuing decade ⁠— but for my money, Firaxis’ vision of a modern XCOM game remains the best video game franchise reboot there’s ever been. 
Still the high bar for a video game remake, Enemy Unknown reimagines 1994’s X-COM: UFO Defense, dropping the dash in the name and dragging this unique strategy game, originally developed by MicroProse, into the modern age.
What makes XCOM brilliant is honestly a matter of sorcery ⁠— or, perhaps chemistry, if we’re being a little less romantic. The point is this: XCOM: Enemy Unknown is that rare pitch perfect game that threads the needle that any video game remake or reboot faces brilliantly. It kept that which made the original a beloved and fondly remembered cult classic, but took informative cues and ideas from games released in the interim. Many games have tried this, of course, but few have been so resoundingly successful at making it all work.

                              <span>Prospective Gotham Knights fans beware: spoilers have cropped up online, ahead of the game&#x27;s release later this month.


Be careful if you spot anything about Gotham Knights online, as there&#x27;s a chance it could be a major plot spoiler. This has apparently come from an early release of the game&#x27;s artbook (thanks, Eurogamer), which is obviously unfortunate for those who might have already seen spoilers.


This in turn has led to Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty to express frustration at sharing spoilers. &quot;I can&#x27;t begin to understand why would anyone spoil a story (whether it&#x27;s a game, a movie, a book, whatever) for others,&quot; wrote Marty on her personal Twitter account.

                              <span>Babylon&#x27;s Fall might have been a failure, but PlatinumGames still intends to have a focus on live service games.


Last month, PlatinumGames delivered the news that the servers for Babylon&#x27;s Fall would be shutting down, and as it&#x27;s an online-only game, that means it&#x27;s going away forever. This wasn&#x27;t particularly surprising news considering a few months ago the game literally only had one player online on Steam at one point. But in a new interview from VGC, the studio&#x27;s CEO Atsushi Inaba hasn&#x27;t changed its plans to progress with more live service titles (thanks, Eurogamer).


&quot;Live service games are definitely something we do want to do and put our effort in moving forward,&quot; Inaba said. &quot;There are two pillars, so to speak, that we can look at internally for our development teams, that being the people within the same company.

                              <span>Splatoon 3&#x27;s next Splatfest is set to ask the age old question: which Pokémon starter type are you going to choose?


As announced on the official Nintendo UK Twitter account, the second Splatfest coming to the threequel is Pokémon themed, where you&#x27;ll either pick grass-, fire-, or water-type. This particular Splatfest is obviously coinciding with the release of Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, and kicks off at 1am UK time November 12, running until November 14, again at 1am, giving you a full 48 hours to splat your friends.


The announcement didn&#x27;t note which types will be assigned to which Deep Cut member, so hopefully your favourite type doesn&#x27;t get attached to your least favourite member (as if there it&#x27;s possible to have a least favourite). Artwork paired with the announcement shows the three types with a little silhouette of the new three starters, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and best-duck Quaxly, too.

                              <span>It looks like a new Crash Bandicoot game is set to be revealed at The Game Awards, as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time gets a Steam release.


Earlier this week, a selection of press and influences received a Crash Bandicoot-themed pizza box that contained stuff like a t-shirt and charging cables, mostly innocuous merch for the most part, as detailed by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks GamesRadar). On the box the Crash 4 Steam release was teased with the text &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-in Pizza Shack,&quot; before just outright saying it&#x27;s coming to the store October 18. But a teaser on the side of the box is potentially hinting at the reveal of the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League.


If you haven&#x27;t heard of Wumpa League before, there have been rumours surrounding the game for quite a while, with some concept art for the game having been shared earlier this year by DidYouKnowGaming&#x27;s Liam Robertson. The reason some suspect that Wumpa League will be revealed at The Game Awards is a line of text on the side of the box that reads, &quot;Hungry for more? Try our new wumpa pizza for $12.08!&quot;

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Chris Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.

In a tweet, Strong - whose own prolific career includes voice performances as Harley Quinn, Batgirl, and Fairly Odd Parents&#x27; Timmy Turner - posted a photograph of herself and Martinet with the text: &quot;it should be Charles&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has resolved an issue where players were accidentally making store purchases whilst using in-game chat, but is allegedly not issuing refunds to those affected.

As shared on the Overwatch subreddit community, Dracyoshi reports that whilst &quot;chatting with some friends while browsing the hero gallery&quot;, the game &quot;unexpectedly began unlocking Junnker Queen&#x27;s Plutonium skin&quot;.

As they&#x27;d been writing a message in chat at the time, they weren&#x27;t able to cancel the purchase before it completed.

During her audition for the part, Ramsey was asked if she&#x27;d played any of Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically-acclaimed game. When she answered honestly - &quot;nope&quot; - she was apparently &quot;encouraged&quot; not to.

&quot;I was actually encouraged not to,&quot; Ramsey told USA Today. &quot;After my first audition, they asked me, &#x27;Have you played it?&#x27; And I said &#x27;nope&#x27;, and they said, &#x27;Keep it that way&#x27;.

Atlus has confirmed that it&#x27;s partnering with Pandasaurus Games to publish the card game designed by Emerson Matsuuchi, whose prior work includes the tabletop games Century: Eastern Wonders and Foundations of Rome.

&quot;Players will take on the roles of their favorite Phantom Thieves and fight to change the world in this cooperative card-based strategy game,&quot; Matsuuchi said.

                              <span>Over the last ten years, I&#x27;ve interviewed many of my childhood heroes - those talented coders I used to read about in the pages of Crash or Your Sinclair. But today is different, because back in 1982, not only did Kevin Toms create a smash hit game, he invented a whole new genre. 


&quot;Conceptually, it was very different to most games,&quot; he explains to me via Skype. &quot;At ZX shows, I had to constantly explain it was a football management game, and they&#x27;d go, &#x27;oh, okay&#x27;.&quot; Often confused for some sort of weird text adventure, it was an abstruse concept for many - but not its author. &quot;I already had the idea for the board game,&quot; explains Toms. &quot;So I just thought a computer could do that, too.&quot;



From a young age, Toms harboured dreams of having a career in tabletop games. &quot;When I was 15, my parents had to see the careers master at school,&quot; he says. &quot;I asked them to ask him if it was possible to get a job as a board game designer.&quot; The inevitable reply came back. &quot;He said it was a phase and that I&#x27;d grow out of it.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s official Xbox controllers, whether from the Series or One generations, are an awesome gamepad for PC gaming too. By default though, your options for connecting the controller are Bluetooth (on later models) or a wired USB connection - rather than the low-latency 2.4GHz wireless you get on Xbox consoles, which requires Microsoft&#x27;s $25 Wireless Adapter for Windows. That adapter is down to $18 at Newegg today, and is well worth picking up while it&#x27;s discounted.

                              <span>One of the things you can do with a Steam Deck is use it for emulation. Someone at Valve is evidently aware of this, given the recent Steam Deck video - which we wrote about two days ago - contained a shot of a Steam library with a Nintendo Switch emulator in it.

Oops. Valve have since deleted and re-uploaded the video with the emulator removed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there&#x27;s usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn&#x27;t happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn&#x27;t crash.

                              <span>Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not every day that you see a top-end gaming laptop for £598 off, especially not when it&#x27;s a 15-in RTX 3080 model from MSI. This GP66 Leopard is one of the fastest gaming laptops on the market, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD and a 144Hz screen - not to mention that flagship-grade graphics card. 
It normally retails for a cool £1998, but today Laptops Direct has discounted it to £1399.97, making it the cheapest RTX 3080 laptop we can find right now.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 at one point featured a bug that caused players to purchase character skins accidentally.
According to various Overwatch 2 players on reddit, the bug that caused the unexpected purchases was related to the in-game chat.
Apparently, if a player was browsing the hero gallery while typing a message in chat, keystrokes were &quot;misinterpreted by the game as an input for navigating the menu.&quot;

                              <span>Valve has released an updated video for Steam Deck after the company realized the original trailer featured an icon for the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu.
The company released the new Steam Deck trailer earlier this week to promote the fact you no longer needed a reservation to order one.
Spotted by eagle-eyed Nibellion (thanks, PC Gamer), you can clearly see the icon for the emulator on the Steam Deck screen in the video. Nibel&#x27;s tweet was eventually seen by Valve, and the company quickly set the video to private and issued a new trailer.

                              <span>The rumor that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake is true, according to film director Christophe Gans.
Speaking in an interview with French outlet MaG - Movie &amp; Game (thanks, ResetEra, via IGN) the Silent Hill movie director claimed that multiple games are in the works from several teams at Konami.
Gans said he is working with the same Silent Hill team he worked with on the first film in the franchise, which we assume is how he gained the information.

                              <span>It looks like the long-awaited System Shock remake will finally release on Steam in March 2023. 

Though not formally confirmed by the developer Nightdive Studios, Steam has updated the game&#x27;s store listing to reveal a March 2023 release date and pre-orders are now open. 

The upcoming release was also spotted and shared by industry insider, Wario64, although some commenters were unsure if this is a real, concrete release date or just an end-of-year placeholder. Guess we&#x27;ll find out in March, eh?

Specifically, P4G is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC Windows, PS4, and Nintendo Switch, whilst P3P is coming to the same, but will also be availa ble on Steam, too.

                              <span>Amazon Games has outlined its plan for MMO Lost Ark with a new development roadmap. 

From now until the end of the year, the team is hoping to introduce three new raids - Mystic Abyss Vycas Legion, and Achates Trial Guardian - as well the Reaper Advanced class in November, and the Summoner Advanced class in December.  

&quot;The next few months mark the road to the Brelshaza Legion Raid — one of the most challenging, unique, and beautifully dangerous raids in all of Lost Ark,&quot; the team explains.

                              <span>PUBG: Battlegrounds&#x27; next update will &quot;refine the gunplay meta&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to developer Krafton, which says update 20.1 – which goes live on 11th October for PC and 19th for consoles and introduces a new ranked season – includes &quot;several improvements to weapon attachments, as well as updates to firing from vehicles, a new ranked season, world and map updates and quality-of-life updates&quot;. 

In response to the Vertical Foregrip &quot;dominating the battlegrounds as the choice grip slot attachment&quot;, the team is changing the Thumbgrip, Angled Foregrip, Halfgrip, Lightweight Grip - and the Vertical Foregrip itself - in a bid to shake things up, promising to &quot;monitor [our] plays after this balance update&quot;.

Yuzu is open-source and, crucially, legal, but as PC Gamer points out, emulation is a sticky topic for some, prompting Valve to upload an emulator-free version of the same video a short while later, which you can see below: 

&quot;Valve&#x27;s new official video for the Steam Deck has a very interesting game icon in it,&quot; industry insider Nibel tweeted yesterday, before following up with: &quot;Update: Valve has removed the original video and reuploaded a new one with a small difference.&quot;

                              <span>Another day, another Silent Hill story: this one purports, yet again, that there are &quot;several teams&quot; working on &quot;several games&quot;, including &quot;the Silent Team&quot; who were around when the first Silent Hill film was made in 2006. 

Christophe Gans, the director of the first Silent Hill movie - who we already knew was reportedly working on a third Silent Hill film - made the surprisingly candid revelations during a recent interview in which he seemingly confirmed the persistent whispers that there&#x27;s more than one Silent Hill game in development, including one by a central internal Konami team.

His interview also definitively confirms that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake, several games are in development, he hasn&#x27;t worked with Kojima, and he &quot;knows a bit about&quot; the next upcoming game.

                              <span>Playing a video game is a deeply personal experience. Unlike other mediums, you&#x27;re in control of what happens. I&#x27;m not just talking about making choices in an RPG, but the way every single press of a button or tilt of a stick adds up to make your playthrough different from mine. While we always bring something of ourselves to books, movies or albums, the core text never changes. Unless you decide to cut up a novel and then stick the pages together in the wrong order or something.


You can watch someone else play a game, and there are now more ways to do so than ever, but it&#x27;s not the same as poking around in someone else&#x27;s game, something I&#x27;d never given any thought to. Not until I saw a message on Twitter asking for help with Elden Ring. This person, who I&#x27;m going to call Sellen, because they asked to be anonymous and it&#x27;s the first Elden Ring NPC name that sprang to mind, had messed up their Elden Ring save game. They&#x27;d accidentally killed an NPC that they very much did not want to kill and were quite distraught. They shared that save with their partner and didn&#x27;t want to potentially ruin the game for them.


Sellen was offering to pay someone to recreate their Elden Ring save, but without the unfortunate death of poor Jar Bairn. I can totally understand why, as young JB is an adorable little example of Elden Ring&#x27;s fascinating pot people. Paying someone to play a game for you may seem strange, but after chatting with them privately, I discovered that they were both busy folks with little time to play games. While they&#x27;d only played the game for sixteen hours or so, that represented a couple of months of shared time that would be hard to get back. Intrigued by the challenge recreating their save presented, I accepted the oddest commission of my freelance career so far.

                              <span>Ever since the release of Deathloop last year, fans have speculated that the acclaimed time loop shooter was, in fact, set in the same universe as Arkane Studios&#x27; much-loved Dishonored series - and now theorists can given finally themselves a pat on the back and pack away their cork boards: the developer has confirmed it is indeed so.


Creative director Dinga Bakaba broke the news during the latest episode of the Xbox podcast (thanks PC Gamer), confirming that Deathloop is &quot;one of the futures of the Dishonored world.&quot;


When asked directly about the possible connection between the two games, Bakaba explained, &quot;We have a number of systems [that mean] not everyone has seen the same thing [in Deathloop], not everyone has heard the same song hidden somewhere, not everyone has seen every room. So it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after [the third Dishonored game] Death of the Outsider.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like the end of 2022 is going to have more than a whiff of Crash Bandicoot about it. Not only has Activision confirmed an 18th October Steam release date for the well-recieved Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, it seems the publisher might just be gearing up to unveil the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League at this year&#x27;s Game Awards.


All this news comes via a bit of promotional tat Activision has been sending out to influencers and press, taking the form of Crash-themed pizza box with goodies inside.


As detailed in a video by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks Games Radar), the promotional pizza box in question comes emblazoned with the words &#x27;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-in Pizza Shack&#x27;, a not too subtle hint that the formerly Battle.net-exclusive PC version of Crash Bandicoot 4 will (as fans had already surmised) soon be making its way to Valve&#x27;s storefront. And to clear up any doubt, that&#x27;s made explicit by an attached label confirming an 18th October Steam release.

                              <span>As the nights start drawing in and the spectre of Halloween looms on the horizon, Planet Zoo is getting just a little bit spooky with the announcement of its new nocturnal-themed Twilight Pack DLC, launching on 18th October.


The big draw of Planet Zoo&#x27;s DLC is always its creature addtions, and the Twilight Pack brings five new nocturnal species: the Racoon, Red Fox, Common Wombat, Striped Skunk, and Egyptian Fruit Bat. The first four of those are free-roaming, meaning you can plop them wherever you please, while the Egyptian Fruit Bat is restricted to a walkthrough exhibit.


Players looking to infuse their zoos with a touch of gothic flair for Halloween can make use of the Twilight Pack&#x27;s 200 new scenery items, ranging from castle-themed building parts - including gargoyles and an imposing portcullis - to glowing pumpkins and cauldrons. Even the flora is getting a bit spooky, with Bristlecone pine trees, ivy, and bioluminescent ghost fungus.

                              <span>Specifically designed mechanical boards for Macs have long been neglected, apart from little-known Matias keyboards or Apple&#x27;s own Mac keyboards in the 80s. Enter Das Keyboard to redress the balance with the amusingly named MacTigr. This keyboard offers a full Mac layout, mechanical switches, a volume knob and plenty of creature comforts - but is it worth its exorbitant $219 asking price? 
First, my credientials: as someone that splits their time between Windows and MacOS, I&#x27;ve been agitating for a proper dedicated MacOS keyboard to swap to. For too long Mac users have been lumbered with the runts of the litter when it comes to keyboards - the current selection is generally awash with non-mechanical options with mushier keys and less consistent key action - even Apple&#x27;s own Magic Keyboards aren&#x27;t all that magic. So, the MacTigr has the potential to deliver a considerable upgrade, with the functionality that Mac users rely on and the mechanical switches they don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re missing.
The MacTigr is a board that offers the traditional Mac layout, odd function keys and all, in a clean and sharp-looking package. The outer casing is comprised almost entirely of metal with a steel top plate and aluminium casing, which means the MacTigr features plenty of heft - it weighs in at 2.4lbs, or just over a kilo for metric users. It&#x27;s remarkably well made, with no signs of deck flex in the case, even under intense typing load, and feels excellent. Despite that heft though, the MacTigr is especially slim and modern looking, especially thanks to its use of MX Low Profile switches, more of which I&#x27;ll talk about in a moment.

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s big new 4.0 update - now officially titled Waypoint - is finally out in the wild. But while developer Hello Games broke from tradition for this latest releases, revealing some of its additions ahead of launch, the studio has now shared some extremely lengthy patch notes, discussing its contents in considerably more granular detail.


The top-level stuff we already knew about; as Hello Games boss Sean Murray told Eurogamer earlier this week, Waypoint - which arrives alongside a new Switch port for No Man&#x27;s Sky - is less about big new additions and more about major quality of life improvements.


To that end, Hello Games had previously teased a bunch of rejigging and streamlining intended to turn No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s last six years of updates &quot;into a more cohesive whole&quot;, as well as a new, less grindy Relaxed mode, a Survival mode revamp, plus extensive options for custom games.

                              <span>This is a quick public service announcement for those keen to avoid any spoilers for the upcoming release of Gotham Knights.


There are currently some major plot spoilers making their way around the internet, following the apparent early release of the game&#x27;s artbook.


I will not go into details of what they are here, I am sure if you are keen to know more you will be able to find out exactly what it is that has been revealed prematurely, but this leak has caused Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer to take to Twitter to complain about spoilers in general.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Overwatch 2 week but not quite the week Blizzard will have imagined. The servers haven&#x27;t worked, there are huge queues to play in the evening, and even when people can log in, there are overly complicated character unlock systems and bolshy Battle Passes to contend with. It&#x27;s not entirely clear what&#x27;s new in this second game when you can play it, either.

Overwatch 2 is overwhelmingly Overwatch. It&#x27;s the same conclusion Edwin Evans-Thirlwell came to in a quick impressions piece published this week while he works on his full review. And it&#x27;s hard not to agree with him. Faced with the same maps and the same characters, Overwatch 2 feels like the same game so many of us will have played so many times before. The differences are there, though, and given time, they make themselves felt. 


Overwatch 2 is the talking point of the week, then, and I&#x27;ve invited Edwin onto Weekly to talk about it. My other guest this week is news reporter Victoria Kennedy, who joins us to talk about Gotham Knights, Moonbreaker and CD Projekt Red as well.

This includes shooting missiles at a giant robot, as you can see in the trailer below (FYI, it is all oddly sensual).

                              <span>Nier Automata is one of the most celebrated last-generation action titles, marrying Platinum Games&#x27; signature stylings with inventive, varied gameplay and a mind-bending narrative. From a technical perspective though, the situation was far from ideal: the game was beset by frame-rate and image quality issues on last-gen machines, with wobbly performance coupled with plenty of aliasing. This is why the Switch port came as a bit of a surprise when it was announced a few months ago: there&#x27;s a huge performance gap between the Switch and even the base last gen consoles with precious little room to cut resolution before image quality becomes unacceptably poor. This seems like one of the so-called &quot;impossible ports&quot; - a technically demanding title downscaled for Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console, often with somewhat mixed results. 


The challenge is clear - and it&#x27;s all down to just how difficult this game was to run on PS4 and Xbox One. Despite relatively pedestrian visuals, the title targeted 900p without any anti-aliasing, with somewhat messy performance on both machines. The typical run of play was 40-60fps, with combat and open-world traversal causing issues. It&#x27;s important to keep this relatively poor showing in mind, because the Nintendo Switch falls far short of those machines in raw number-crunching performance. So what kind of compromises are we seeing here? 


Relative to base last-gen consoles, the Switch release is comprehensively downgraded - though the overall image still looks surprisingly comparable. Measuring the game against its Xbox One S counterpart, the first thing that stands out is a significant reduction in texture detail. Across the board, textures are degraded, with lower resolutions not to mention simplified layers and material properties. In some areas, the textures look soupy, with no fine detail to speak of, though most of the time it&#x27;s not quite as severe.

The Splatfest will take place in-game from the 11th November.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Platinum Games made the decision to cease all updates to its beleaguered live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall, and announced it would be  &quot;terminating the game&#x27;s service&quot; on Tuesday, 28th February 2023. The game itself had received a poor reception across the board, with criticisms ranging from its monetisation model to its £60 price tag.


However, despite the fall of Babylon&#x27;s Fall, the developer is not taking its eyes off any future live service games. 


In an interview with VGC, Platinum Games boss Atsushi Inaba said the team has &quot;learned from this experience [with Babylon&#x27;s Fall]&quot; and it had not &quot;changed [its] future plans or outlook&quot; because of it.

                              <span>The classic board game Catan is on its way to consoles in 2023.


This isn&#x27;t the first time it&#x27;s been adapted into a video game, but this new version is set for release across Xbox and PlayStation consoles.


It&#x27;s coming courtesy of Asmodee Entertainment and Dovetail Games, the former being responsible for a number of board game adaptations and the latter developing the likes of Train Sim World 2020.

                              <span>Core members of the Disco Elysium team were &quot;fired under false premises&quot;, Martin Luiga has claimed in a new interview.

Luiga, one of the co-founders of the studio ZA/UM, originally stated the three leads had left &quot;involuntarily&quot;.

Designer Robert Kurvitz, one of the developers affected, later confirmed that he, along with writer Helen Hindpere and art director Aleksander Rostov, was no longer working at the studio.

                              <span>It&#x27;s finally here. Well over four years after we found out that Nintendo was partnering with Illumination for a Super Mario Bros. movie, last night gave us our first glimpse of the partnership and it was... interesting.
From Illumination&#x27;s rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom through to Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser, Keegan Michael-Key&#x27;s Toad, Charlie Day&#x27;s Luigi and - of course - Chris Pratt&#x27;s not-so-novel take on Mario, there&#x27;s a lot to unpack. So here&#x27;s what Team Eurogamer made of the big Super Mario Bros. movie reveal.

So, after a lot of hype from a certain Mr. Chris Pratt, who assured us this trailer would blow our minds, we finally got the new teaser for Illumination&#x27;s upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie and, I have to say, I kind of loved it.

                              <span>In November 2021 I filed a feature request for the fish shell to add underscore as a thousand separator in
numbers. My feature request has been implemented and is available
in fish 3.5.0, released 16 June 2022.
The fish shell supports mathematical operations using the math command.

The underscore can be used as a thousand separator, but there are other uses for a number separator. Here&#x27;s a list taken
from a post by Mathias Bynens about the number separator in JavaScript:
// A decimal integer literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
1_000_000_000_000
// A decimal literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
1_000_000.220_720
// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per octet:
0b01010110_00111000
// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per nibble:
0b0101_0110_0011_1000
// A hexadecimal integer literal with its digits grouped by byte:
0x40_76_38_6A_73
// A BigInt literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
4_642_473_943_484_686_707n 



Programming languages are gradually adding a number separator to their syntax, I think Perl was the first. Most are
languages use underscore, but C++ 14 uses an apostrophe for the number separator.</span>

                              <span>A new trailer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been released, showing how spiffy the game looks running on PC.
The game features 4K and Ultrawide support and boasts over 500 customization options.
Other than what was provided for the beta, information on minimum and recommended specs at release have yet to be posted. But with the trailer out for the platform, we suspect a list to be provided rather soon. It is out on October 28, after all.

It&#x27;s been a bit of a wait, so we&#x27;re happy to hear the release is getting close.
A sequel to God of War (2018), the ninth installment in the series finds Kratos and his son Atreus facing a series of events that bring about the end of days and the deaths of some of the Norse gods. Basically, Ragnarok.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima is teasing his next game, which many believe to be Death Stranding 2.
The first tease from Kojima appeared at TGS 2022 back in September, with a poster featuring a silhouette with the face obscured and the words &quot;Who AM I&quot; printed across it (thanks, Polygon).
At PAX Australia, which is going on now, a QR Code is present that when scanned leads to an image posted on the Kojima Productions website showing an image of Elle Fanning (The Great) with the same words printed on it.

                              <span>Saving your game shouldn’t be so stressful. Getting to a Registration Point and operating the key card-activated, payphone like system – it takes seconds. But seconds are precious. Especially when there’s something, somewhere nearby, lurking. Waiting. Breathing. Watching. You’re pressing the skin of your face to the inside of a locker, eyeing up that terminal, knowing it’s less than 20 feet away, probably. But, moments ago, you heard the telltale ding of sinew on metal. The Xenomorph is nearby. And it’s waiting for you to make your move.

Time is running out. Both in the game, and in your real life – you need to save, and get on with that article you’re supposed to be writing. So you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and try to slink out of the little cupboard you’ve crammed yourself into as quietly as possible. A glance at your motion tracker seems to suggest you’re safe. Footsteps echoing through the deserted Sevastopol station. Breath ragged in your ears. The blinking light of the terminal closing in. Your hand on the machine. Then – fuck – it’s coming up and out of your chest. Its tail, tearing through your ribs, your lungs. That’s it. Game over, Ripley. 
Some may argue that this is appalling game design, making you gamble on whether or not you can actually save your game. You can lose hours of progress if you mess up your timing, if you gamble against Ripley’s ability to stay alive. But I think it perfectly encapsulates what makes Alien: Isolation one of the best games, ever. Even saving your game makes you think about survival – makes you think about death.

                              <span>Square Enix has warned Final Fantasy 14 players of a hacking attempt and suggests everyone with an account change their passwords.
According to the company, it is currently experiencing an attack by a third party attempting to gain access to the Square Enix Account Management System. They are doing this by using a combination of email addresses and passwords possibly obtained from “online services of other companies.&quot;
Square advises against using the same email address and password combination for your Square Enix account as you do for other online services, as it increases the possibility of a third party gaining unauthorized access to your account. That said, you are still at a high risk of your account being accessed should your password contain an easy pattern, sequences of characters, or your DOB.

                              <span>Electronic Arts has released its EA app for Windows out of beta, and it is now available for all to download.
The app will replace Origin, the PC platform EA introduced over 10 years ago. The app, according to EA, is &quot;faster, more reliable, and more streamlined&quot; than Origin, and will be the &quot;best possible place&quot; to experience the company&#x27;s games, services and content.
With the app, you can automatically download games and background updates, and build your friends list by connecting your EA account to other platforms and services like Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. Each user will also have a custom and unique ID, and once connected to the app, users will know what and when friends are playing, allowing players to jump in and game together.

                              <span>^Stay tuned after the ads for my full RAILGRADE review and enjoy some beautiful ultrawide footage while you’re at it.


It’s not often that video games set out to mimic small things. Photorealism tends to depict the world at a scale that humans can walk around in. But, swivelling a macro-lens onto that Unreal Engine camera and pointing it at digital miniatures produces a wonderful effect that makes RAILGRADE’s otherwise fairly standard route plan puzzling an absolute joy to get stuck into.


In short, it’s transportive. For me, it throws me right back to my childhood bedroom, where a constantly reconfigured TOMY train set enjoyed permanent residence on the floor, forever delivering assorted handfuls of lego bricks between the Ghostbusters fire station and a permanently downed Star Trek: The Next Generation shuttlecraft. Who knows why. The mind of a ten year-old is unknowable, even if you were one.

                              <span>Just a few days ago, Hello Games’ Sean Murray detailed what No Man’s Sky 4.0 update would look like in an interview with PCGamer. We’re already well aware of what’s in store, and that’s various adjustments to make the game welcoming for newcomers or returning players, or simply more engaging for veterans who believe they’ve done it all.
This includes a relaxed mode, and a survival mode, both of which offer easier and harder difficulties depending on what type of player you are. On top of that, there’s performance improvements, increased inventory space, and of course, perhaps the biggest accompaniment of the whole 4.0 update, the space-exploration title has finally arrived on Nintendo Switch.
That said, those playing the game on Nintendo Switch will not only be able to explore the vast expanse of space with responsive touch controls in handheld mode, they’ll also be able to bag themselves some freebies for supporting Hello Games’ survival game on the handheld.

                              <span>EGX was two weeks ago, which is wild. Time has really flown by. But, there’s one game there that’s really stuck in my mind as of late — especially as I&#x27;ve been kicking my heels in Overwatch 2 queues and looking for a quick, competitive FPS fix in the downtime. Enter Squad Blast, which has fixed itself onto me ever since I got my hands on it back in London. It’s got the spirit of Overwatch and CS:GO, but all excitingly represented on a 2D plane. As a result, it really is quite brilliant.
I spent a good chunk of my time at EGX messing around with Squad Blast, and was fortunate enough to interview Anatolijs Ropotovs – CEO and founder of Ultrahorse – about the inspirations for the title, what the studio is hoping to achieve, and why it thinks players will hop over from some of the genre’s big hitters and try out this fresh, more 2D approach.
Squad Blast is a team-based competitive shooter, where you and your partner set out to outsmart and outgun the enemy team within short, punchy objective-based matches. It’s hero-based, which means different characters have different weapons and abilities, and even in my short hour-or-so playing it at the show I could feel the counter-pick meta bubbling behind the scenes. The sniper dominates mid-ranged rocket users, the shotgun beats out the sniper, and the rocket is damn good at cutting off offensive shotgun pushes. You can play defensive, you can play offensive, but you’ve absolutely got to play well... otherwise you’ll see the clear difference between yourself and your opponents. Like in any good competitive title.

                              <span>It feels odd saying &quot;Overwatch 1&quot;, but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game&#x27;s tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I&#x27;d grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I&#x27;d eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch&#x27;s intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2&#x27;s release, it all feels like it&#x27;s come full circle.

                              <span>Archtower is a roguelike and therefore bad, but... hnnnnnnngggh I like it. I might even come to love it, considering it&#x27;s already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a &quot;work in progress&quot; marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It&#x27;s good stuff all round, frankly.

                              <span>A new experience: Weird RPG is the first video game to make my lips numb. My character in the action-RPG is wearing magic tousers, see, which launch explosive basketball hoops every time I make noise into my microphone. Turns out, the most DPS-efficient noise is continually blowing to trill my lips like a child pretending to be a car. Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it&#x27;s too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

                              <span>Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths&#x27; interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the &quot;church mystery&quot; or &quot;sadfutago&#x27;s posts&quot;, among other monikers.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an increasingly ancient beast, gnarled and twisted over the past decade-and-a-bit by many, many mods that sometimes conflict with one another. That’s why Tyler Hallada put together Modmapper, a free tool released earlier this year that shows which of the mods hosted at NexusMods affect which areas of Skyrim. Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

That one! The one with the robots and the Soviet Alien dot detector thing!&quot; The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year&#x27;s E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I&#x27;ve now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don&#x27;t much like the look of that there laser bot.

Key to this are custom game modes, auto-saves, dynamic difficulty, and inventory streamlining. There’s also a new relaxed mode for the particularly chilled among us. Watch the update trailer below for a rundown, and some trippy space visuals.

                              <span>Electronic Arts have formally launched their new store client doodad after a long open beta, replacing the much-maligned Origin with something they refer to as &quot;the EA app&quot; (its actual name is only &quot;EA&quot;). They say it&#x27;s faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn&#x27;t really matter, as long as it&#x27;s not a disaster, because it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.
