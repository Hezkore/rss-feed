                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 doesn&#x27;t really take cyberpsychosis seriously, but a new mod changes that.


Modder DJ_Kovrik has created the Wannabe Edgerunner mod that adds in the Humanity stat.


Essentially, every piece of cyberware has a Humanity Cost that gradually drives your character towards cyberpsychosis.

The Cyberpunk 2077 team lifted the lid on this new project earlier today and, while details on this novel (for now at least) are still fairly thin on the ground, we know that it will be called &quot;No Coincidence&quot;. 
Meanwhile, the story will follow a &quot;group of strangers&quot; doing what they can to negotiate the &quot;dangers of Night City&quot;. Something of which, we all know, there are many.

The game had a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign - it was funded in under 36 hours with over $1.6m pledged.


A new trailer has been released to announce the Early Access launch, which gives a look at how it all plays.

Stripe&#x27;s arrival follows that of fellow Gremlins alum Gizmo. Unlike Gizmo, however, Stripe will wield a chainsaw - you know, for those times when you want to go full Ash Williams. 


Stripe&#x27;s standard look is unlockable with either 2000 Gold, one Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium. If you fancy something a little bit more Rambo-like, you can unlock his Combat Stripe variant with 800 Gleamium.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 battle royale The First Soldier will shut down in January next year.


The game was first released in November 2021, meaning its shelf life was a little over 12 months.


News of its end was announced on Twitter: &quot;Despite all our efforts to bring you regular updates with fresh and exciting content, we haven&#x27;t been able to deliver the experience that we were hoping to, and that you all deserve, so we have made the extremely tough decision to end service for Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier.&quot;

                              <span>Facebook parent company Meta has snaffled up several developers, including ReCore maker Armature Studio, to fold into its own Oculus Studios brand. 


Armature will be joined as part of Meta by LocoCycle and &#x27;Splosion Man developer Twisted Pixel Games, as well as Marvel&#x27;s Iron Man VR company Camouflaj. 


Meta made the acquisition announcements last night as part of its Meta Connect event, where it also confirmed a partnership with Xbox Cloud Gaming to see Microsoft&#x27;s game streaming tech arrive on Quest VR headsets. The new £1500 Quest Pro headset was also given an official unveiling - after an early unit recently turned up in a hotel.

                              <span>Developer Volition has detailed its Saints Row reboot&#x27;s first major update, saying that while it would have &quot;preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions&quot; at this juncture, it will initially be prioritising &quot;improvements over new features&quot;.


Saints Row released to a middling reception in August, with its enjoyable open-world zaniness rather dampened by its considerable number of bugs. It&#x27;s these that Volition hopes to address in its first major post-launch update in November, explaining in a new blog post, &quot;We know there is still work to do to improve your experience in the game.&quot;


&quot;We are supporting Saints Row for the long-term,&quot; it insisted, &quot;and while we&#x27;d have preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions, right now we feel the focus must be on telling you how we&#x27;re going to improve the... experience for all players in 2022 and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 has passed 27 million registered players, according to director Naoki Yoshida on a special celebration livestream. The figure was unveiled from a large golden disco ball alongside Square Enix CEO Yosuke Matsuda, which I can now only assume is the way they reveal any big news within the company.
This is an astounding milestone for the game of course, which quickly rose in popularity in the west during both the COVID lockdowns and Activision Blizzard’s epic fumbling of the once lustrous World of Warcraft ball. It became so popular in fact that they had to stop new players from creating accounts!
That’s not all from the livestream either. Alongside the chunky 27 million flex, the team also seemed confident that they could reach 30 million by next year, coincidentally the 10-year anniversary of the MMORPG’s release. With the ever-growing popularity of the title, it’s hard to imagine it not making it to be honest, even with World of Warcraft: Dragonflight launching in late November and tempting back Blizzard refugees who may have jumped ship recently.

                              <span>You know you’ve got a good game on your hands when its Steam Next Fest demo manages to infiltrate – and climb! – the Top 50 Most Played games list in just one week. You know it’s a game worth looking at when critics and consumers alike flock to a demo, eager to see what all the buzz is about. UNDECEMBER has managed to whip up something of a cult following already – and it’s not even out yet. 

It’s probably because the cross-platform hack ‘n’ slash RPG is doing something different. In UNDECEMBER, you take on the role of a Rune Hunter: a hero destined to stop the 13th god of this world – one pre-determined to be evil and unholy – from being born. The other 12 gods shared out their powers and gifts to Rune Hunters, giving humans the ability to prevent the birth of their awful sibling. It’s up to you to hunt down those powers and use them for yourself. 

To that end, in UNDECEMBER, there is no set class. When you boot up the game, you select either a male or female character, adjust your appearance, and then that’s it – you’re in the world. There’s no shaman, demon hunter, warrior, paladin; instead, you build your character with gears and skills of your choice as you move on.

                              <span>It’s time for some more news about that one game we love to complain about right now, and that’s – obviously – Overwatch 2. 
After a rocky launch consisting of congested servers, a controversial SMS Protect system, multiple DDoS attacks, and plenty of other bugs, Blizzard are attempting to make good by offering a digital goodybag to players.
Even then, this digital goodybag certainly falls under the mark when it comes to making reparations with players. In a recent tweet on the Overwatch account, Blizzard said that, “When #Overwatch2 launch is bumpy, you make it up to players. Besides making progress on bug fixes &amp; stabilization, we&#x27;ve got goodies to share with all players.”

                              <span>Call Of Duty fans are getting worked up about whether there’ll be a new game in the military shooter series next year, as a yearly instalment has been tradition since 2005. Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has waded in to allege that, while there will be some fresh COD in the offing, it’ll be in the form of something like a paid expansion for the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 instead of a full game.

                              <span>The Saints Row reboot sees its first major update next month, but don’t expect any new stuff in Santo Ileso to play around with. Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues.

                              <span>2K Games have confirmed that personal data was stolen during a security breach last month. The game publisher had previously announced that their support services had been hacked and asked users not to open any links received from them via email. They&#x27;re now contacting users whose information was accessed and made available for sale by the hackers.

It will reportedly feature all four major golfing championships, as well as several of the world&#x27;s most famous courses. You can find the thirty seconds of footage of grass and sandpits below.

                              <span>I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee&#x27;s recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as &quot;extremely relevant to [my] interests&quot;. So relevant, in fact, that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this wasn&#x27;t an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn&#x27;t do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it&#x27;s immediately become my favourite thing I&#x27;ve ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I&#x27;ve been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice&#x27;s part. No idea if I&#x27;ve succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

                              <span>I was underwhelmed by Prime Day’s lack of compelling desktop RAM deals, and Amazon’s follow-up – the Prime Early Access Sale – is also pretty quiet for good memory discounts. However, there are some intriguing offers on DDR5 RAM, which is perfect timing: AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs have just launched, and unlike their Intel 13th Gen/Raptor Lake rivals, won’t be compatible with older DDR4 at all.

Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn&#x27;t have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent&#x27;s ball: that was just extraneous detail.

                              <span>Not keen on the snazzy driving effects in recently announced racer Need For Speed Unbound? That’s okay, because devs Criterion Games have confirmed that you don’t have to play the game with great big puffs of colourful smoke dredging up from your car’s wheels, or cartoon wings popping out when you drive up a ramp and get some air. I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

                              <span>Coral Island  self-describes as a &quot;reimagining of farming games&quot;, but if we&#x27;re being real it doesn&#x27;t reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that&#x27;s what we call ourselves).
That&#x27;s not to say Coral Island isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you&#x27;re doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe&#x27;s smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

                              <span>Capcom are making literal big bad Lady Dimitrescu a wee bit shorter for Resident Evil Village’s The Mercenaries Additional Orders DLC, out later this month. Game director Kento Kinoshita told Polygon that although playable Lady D is still taller than any other character in Mercenaries, she’s been shortened to “a little under nine feet tall” from her canon height of around nine feet six inches. Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

                              <span>In case you missed the mega-guide that went up earlier, today marks the start of Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale: a two-day buffet of discounts that’s exclusive to Prime members. That includes loads on PC gaming hardware, though my eyes were most immediately caught by something not very desktop-grade at all. The SanDisk Ultra, one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck, is on sale across a choice of capacities – with the 1TB model getting especially juicy &gt;50% savings in both the UK and US.

TheGhostOfHope has tweeted a list of what they say are upcoming operators for the military FPS sequel, launching later this month. Among the other spots are a potential return for the controversial Roze skin, and Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare’s protagonist Nick Reyes.

It&#x27;s a competitive PVE game where teams of heroes fight it out to finish a dungeon run the fastest. And having seen a brief presentation of it behind closed doors, it looks like a good time - albeit one taking heavy inspiration from its main competitors.

It’s interesting timing, considering Black Friday 2022 is next month, but this Amazon-only sale does provide some fresh opportunities to pick up some components, peripherals or gaming laptops at more agreeable prices. Therefore, I’ll be here across the two-day event – that’s October 11th and 12th – keeping track of all the best Prime Early Access deals on PC gaming hardware that I can find.

The latest attack came just after Overwatch 2 had finished a period of emergency maintenance. Although Blizzard have confirmed the DDoS attack has now ended, the recurring attacks aren’t exactly a good sign for a game already beset by technical issues.

                              <span>Rather than launching a new Call of Duty title in 2023, Activision is reportedly planning to instead release a premium expansion including new &quot;campaign content&quot; for Modern Warfare 2.


Word of new paid campaign DLC for Modern Warfare 2 was initially shared by Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who claimed it would arrive in the game&#x27;s second year (ie. 2023) and would be bundled with a 20th anniversary &quot;greatest hits map pack&quot; containing classic maps from the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2, as well as maps from across the series.


Following TheGhostofHope&#x27;s campaign DLC claims, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier stepped in to corroborate the news. &quot;Next year [Activision Blizzard will] be selling new stuff for MW2&quot;, he wrote in a tweet, &quot;an expansion or something like that&quot;. Although Schreier admitted he wasn&#x27;t &quot;sure exactly what it&#x27;ll look like&quot;, he claimed it would have &quot;campaign stuff too&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft and Meta have announced a partnership that will see Xbox Cloud Gaming be made available on Quest VR headsets.


Xbox Cloud Gaming gives Game Pass Ultimate subscribers the ability to stream and play a steadily growing number of titles on a range of Android, Apple, and Windows devices, as well as Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox consoles, and eventually, Microsoft&#x27;s dedicated Keystone device. 


And that list, as revealed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during today&#x27;s Meta Connect event, has now grown to include Quest VR head sets.

                              <span>Ahead of its launch next spring, EA has offered a first look at its previously announced &quot;next generation&quot; PGA Tour game for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


EA Sports PGA Tour - the publisher&#x27;s first foray into golfing sims since 2015&#x27;s Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March last year, promising to deliver world famous golf courses and professional golfers as part of a long-term deal with the PGA Tour.


One year-long delay later, EA Sports PGA Tour is shuffling ever-closer to release, and EA&#x27;s first major reveal for the game comes in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer.

It&#x27;s the Among Us experience in VR, with tasks, emergency meetings and venting all provided in an immersive 360 degrees - or available to glimpse in a more standard fashion via the YouTube trailer below.

                              <span>On 20th October, Phantom Abyss will be rope-swinging its way onto Xbox Game Pass.


Along with this announcement, we also have a nice shiny new trailer from Devolver Digital to mark the occasion. This trailer, which you can see below, shows off some of the extreme temple runs that you as the player will have to navigate.  


This &quot;massive asynchronous multiplayer&quot; will throw players into those temples seen above and task them with retrieving ancient relics from within. There will be hidden traps to account for, and, as with all good temple exploration, there will of course be guardians that will do everything in their power to stop players from reaching their goal.

A new gameplay video shared on Twitter shows the customisation options, urging players to &quot;get noticed&quot;.


It&#x27;s all part of the game&#x27;s visual style that marries realistic vehicles with colourful, animated street art.

                              <span>Are standard Xbox controllers a little too ordinary for your tastes? Then perhaps Microsoft&#x27;s has the answer with its newly revealed - and purportedly &quot;surreal&quot; - Lunar Shift special edition affair.


In what way, you might reasonably be wondering,  is the Lunar Shift Special Edition Wireless Controller &quot;surreal&quot;? Is it perhaps formed from the whisper of a backward-speaking entity in a red-curtain-clad room? Does it droop provocatively across surfaces like a slowly melting pocket watch? Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?


Alas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift&#x27;s big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year&#x27;s Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light. This, says, Microsoft, gives it a &quot;stylised, smokey atmosphere&quot;.

                              <span>Shipments of PS5 consoles to the US in September had a 400 percent increase year-over-year, according to a financial analyst.

David Gibson, senior analyst at MST Financial, shared a graph on Twitter showing the imports to the US per month from June 2021 onwards, with a huge spike during last month.

Gibson added he believes some of the stock will go towards the launch of God of War Ragnarök, which makes a lot of sense. Ragnarök is the next first-party title for PlayStation, and Sony will be undoubtedly eager to capitalise on its release to bolster sales of the PS5.

                              <span>There have been some rumblings that Sony, along with developer Naughty Dog, decided to release its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) to monopolise on the upcoming HBO series inspired by the game.
However, PlayStation head Hermen Hulst has made it known that this is not the case. Well, at least, it is not entirely the case.
Chatting to Axios, Hulst stated that the initial 2013 release of The Last of Us was &quot;a little ahead of its time in terms of its creative vision&quot;. Hulst claimed that the limitations of technology at this time meant that Naughty Dog&#x27;s ideas ultimately had to be dialled back a notch or two.

                              <span>I recently discovered that I am towards the micromanagement end of the scale when it comes to Football Manager. Or maybe more accurately, off the end of that scale, a spec in the distance visible only with the kind of magnifying glass I use to inspect my player&#x27;s daily training habits. I&#x27;m the one you hear about with the spreadsheets and the 100 percent press conference attendance record, and while I have no shame at all, it has always made me a bit sceptical of FM&#x27;s portable modes, the recent Xbox versions included.


Having played it for a good few hours of it up at developer Sports Interactive&#x27;s studios, however, the new PS5 version of FM23 goes a good way towards putting me at ease. There are a few versions here, so for clarity a quick whip-round: Football Manager is the fullest version, which you can only play on PC; FM Mobile is the lightest version designed for playing on commutes and sun loungers, with a heavily trimmed-back set of features and systems; FM Touch is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Mobile, designed for the Switch; FM Xbox was brought in more recently and is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Touch, but still a long way off from full-fat Football Manager. 


This year, with the arrival of the PS5 version, things have been rejigged a little. The Xbox version is gone, and there&#x27;s now FM Console, which is the same across PS5 and Xbox (but Switch is still Touch). FM Console is definitely lighter than the full version, but also far, far closer to it than ever before. In brief, it feels like the main, PC Football Manager game was the starting point here, with things tweaked to fit into a console-style user experience, as opposed to being built from the Mobile version outwards.

There&#x27;ll be three figurines going on sale next month: a yellow Inkling, a blue Octoling, and Smallfry.

Take a look at the announcement video below to get a closer look at them.

                              <span>Earlier this month, high-profile modder Lance McDonald announced that the PlayStation 5 had been &quot;jailbroken&quot;.
Now, following the discovery of this jailbreaking exploit, McDonald has been rifling around in the files for both BluePoint&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Souls remake and those of the elusive Abandoned from developer Blue Box Game Studio.

When having a closer look at those files for Demon&#x27;s Souls, McDonald came across a rather endearing and fun inclusion by developer BluePoint Games. It turns out that there are 3D model files for the one and only &#x27;Ring of the Chieftain&#x27; tucked away in the PS5 remake.

                              <span>The embargo lifts today on Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce RTX 4090 and it&#x27;s a phenomenal achievement in graphics performance - as you might hope and expect from a $1600/£1650 GPU. The full Eurogamer review will follow as soon as possible but so much work in Digital Foundry has been poured into this project that we&#x27;ve only just managed to finish the video review in time. With minutes left until the embargo lifts, I wanted to share the review with the Eurogamer audience - and to offer up some personal thoughts on the product.
First of all, I think it is important to stress that the power level of this product shows a leap in performance that surrounding components within a gaming PC may struggle to fully access. 1080p and 1440p metrics with this product are essentially meaningless - even with my Core i9 12900K overclocked to 5.2GHz on all performance cores, I&#x27;m finding frame-rates hitting the CPU limit. This happens even on some 4K benchmarks without ray tracing in the equation. And even if you are using RT, opting for DLSS performance mode (with an internal 1080p base image) can again see you hitting the limits of your processor.
Over the last few weeks, it&#x27;s been really interesting just to &#x27;live&#x27; with the card for PC gaming - I use a 4K 120Hz LG OLED CX display, and it&#x27;s a good fit for the RTX 4090. I don&#x27;t need to worry about settings, I don&#x27;t need to worry about performance. I&#x27;d venture to suggest that for non-RT gaming, the graphics problem is &#x27;solved&#x27;. Ray tracing? No worries there either, thanks to DLSS. However, if I did not have a 4K 120Hz display, I do wonder whether I&#x27;d need the 4090. That&#x27;s my subjective opinion on gaming with the card, but here&#x27;s the full video review where you get all the numbers you need.

                              <span>Oh, it&#x27;s a challenge to describe Evercore Heroes. A pleasant challenge. The name doesn&#x27;t tell you very much. The team, which contains a number of people who worked on League of Legends, describes it as &quot;competitive PvE&quot;. My own notes from a recent online presentation suggest it&#x27;s a WoW raid mixed with a bit of Puyo Tetris. Having had the time to think about it, though, I suspect the whole thing is like one of those fancy cocktails where the different elements separate and form a rainbow strata: Evercore Heroes is simple at first, then complicated, and then ultimately pretty simple again. And hopefully delicious.


Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;d start. You jump into a team of four heroes, all working through a sort of raid area. You&#x27;re fighting mobs in order to get more powerful, because at the end of …</span>

                              <span>Capcom had to make Lady Dimitrescu a tiny bit shorter for the upcoming Resident Evil Village DLC.

As part of The Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC, out on 28th October, Mercenaries mode will be getting more content, and we&#x27;ll finally be able to play as the lady herself.

But in order to accomodate her stature, the development team had to make a small compromise on her height.

                              <span>Following Overwatch 2&#x27;s fairly shambolic release that involved targeted DDoS attacks, Blizzard has reported interruptions this week to Battle.net via a further DDOS attack, causing login issues. 


In addition, Overwatch 2&#x27;s character roster has had to be downsized a tad to allow Blizzard to &quot;iron out a few bugs&quot;. Unfortunately for the developer, however, this has created a new bug of its own, resulting in even more characters becoming inaccessible for some Overwatch 2 players.


On the official customer support Twitter account, Blizzard addressed the DDoS attack faced by Battle.net yesterday. This has reportedly now all been dealt with, however it managed to cause widespread issues for players of both Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

                              <span>Alice Ruppert has been speaking out about how horses are represented in games ever since Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3. She&#x27;d had such high hopes for it after Red Dead Redemption 1, a game and series she really rates. But when AC3 came along and horses were nothing more than disposable taxis you could pick up at every outpost, she was sorely disappointed. The game didn&#x27;t even save your horse choice through loading screens. She&#x27;s been speaking out about horses in games ever since.
She does it on the wonderfully named website The Mane Quest, where her in-depth reviews - she records horse movement and analyses it frame by frame - have earnt her a loyal following. Her work, and her background in game design, eventually even got her a job making a horse game called  Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is out really soon on PC and Switch.
So how bad are horses in games today? Read on, dear reader. I&#x27;ll deal with a few famous games before broadening into more general mistakes, and what they can do about them. All of this is taken from my podcast interview with Alice Ruppert, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts (look for &quot;Eurogamer Podcasts&quot;).

                              <span>Square Enix Montréal - the developer behind the likes of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go - has rebranded as Studio Onoma following its acquisition by Embracer Group in May.


Square Enix Montréal was one of three studios purchased by Embracer Group as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix earlier this year. Following the deal&#x27;s completion in August, Embracer now also owns Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal, alongside major IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain.


While Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal will keep their existing identities following the Embracer acquisition, Square Enix Montréal has now shaken off the last remnants of its former owner with a new name and new logo, both of which have been detailed in a lengthy post on the developer&#x27;s website. The key takeway for the curious, though, is that &quot;Onoma is Greek for name and names offer endless possibilities&quot;.

While there is no date yet, Microsoft said it will share more on this &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;

According to the official Need for Speed Unbound Twitter account, while you can choose your driving effects, you can also choose never to turn them on in the first place.
While with Unbound you can still race around in hyper-realistic cars, you can also turn your experience into an art form with self-expression. This comes in the form of being able to &quot;tag the world&quot; when deploying your boosting powers. Tags are earned through actions such as drifting, jumps, and near misses.

While looking over a tweet from the executive showing off shelves of items, on the very top shelf there&#x27;s a small white box that looks similar to a mini-Xbox. Even the power button looks similar.
This has led many to believe the small box is the streaming device Microsoft has in the works under the codename &quot;Keystone&quot;.

                              <span>Back in June, we learned that Overwatch 2 would be ditching its controversial loot boxes. The industry celebrated, and why not? Various countries around the world have decreed that loot boxes equate to gambling, with the UK government demanding publishers put measures in place that safeguard children from the adverse effects of them. 18 European countries have also backed measures calling for loot box regulation.

For Overwatch – one of the biggest games that popularised the use of loot boxes in the first place – to renege and opt for the battle pass (as seen in Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Fortnite, and many others besides)... that’s a big move. Seismic. It had the potential to rewrite the rule book, set a precedent for responsible and engaging progression whilst still monetizing the game. Because that, essentially, is what this is all about. Instead, though, the battle pass implementation has been one of the worst I’ve seen in a game for a long time – possibly ever. 

Let’s set the scene. Overwatch is dead. There’s no going back to the original game, now; it is offline, supplanted and replaced wholly by Overwatch 2. The way you used to earn cosmetics and goods for your various heroes – by opening loot boxes and getting randomised rewards – has been replaced with two tracks of a battle pass (one paid, one free).

That&#x27;s according to various Twitter users (thanks, Windows Central) who noticed a new play button was available next to a game when entered into the Bing search bar.
Once you hit the play button, just sign in and start playing the game. This option only seems to work with Microsoft Edge and not with Chrome.

                              <span>Are you tired of fighting tooth and nail for a PS5? Wouldn’t you like to leave the fist fights and public brawls behind in favour of a more adult, more refined gaming experience? Well BMW, of all companies, may be your answer brave wanderer. Starting next year, owners of these fancy, expensive cars will be able to play a variety of games from inside their shiny rides. Hopefully not while driving… Unless you wanna take your gamer credentials to a whole other, almost certainly illegal, level.
This doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to plug a Dualsense or Xbox pad into your car. No, instead the new gaming collection will be played via a connected Smartphone and the in-built Curved Display. The official press release states that the partnership between the BMW Group and Airconsole (who is responsible for the phones-as-gamepads tech used) will “bring casual gaming into new BMW vehicles”. So Mythic WoW Raiders, Warzone demons, and Rocket League zoomers may not be the target audience here. 
Looking at the AirConsole website, it’s clear this is the responsible family’s gaming option. Titles like Brawlanders, Golfriends, Monkey Business and almost 180 more titles clearly appeal to a younger crowd who’d otherwise be causing havoc in the back seats. However, Drunk Casino is the clear winner for me, and sounds like the perfect title for me while I’m headed to work. If I owned a BMW, or a car, or could drive.

                              <span>It’s felt like DLSS has been in the process of becoming an irreplaceable tentpole feature of graphical video game presentation for a while now. As more games adopt the feature and its similar equivalents from other companies, it becomes ever harder to justify turning it off – and with some tasty demos for its latest iteration, Nvidia appears to be truly upping the ante. 
DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, and it’s a clever AI-assisted feature that essentially allows you to get higher frame rates in games without having to sacrifice their visual fidelity. A game that might only run at 30 frames per second in regular settings could previously often be cranked up to over 60fps with DLSS enabled – and with DLSS 3.0, Nvidia aims to crank the gains up even further.
The way DLSS works is pretty simple. AI models are trained on the visuals of games, meaning that the AI can effectively upscale a game with such accuracy in its fidelity that it’s near-enough indistinguishable from the game natively running at a much higher resolution. Running at a lower initial resolution is helpful for settings, however, allowing you to crank up all those delicious PC gaming graphics toggles to max – including ray tracing, the transformative lighting feature that also has a habit of tanking frame rates.

                              <span>Evercore Heroes — a new game coming from Vela Games with former EA and Riot Veterans behind the wheel — has just been announced! The Dublin-based studio’s premier title, the game combines real-time skill focused gameplay found in MOBAs, with the cooperative teamplay required in MMO dungeon runs in what could be a unique twist on a popular genre.
The game is set in a science x fantasy world called Lumerea, where a range of diverse and unique heroes can be found and of course played around with. This includes characters like the shadowy assassin Shade, the steadfast tanky defender Fyn, and Shining archer Zari among others. As you may expect, each hero has their own skills, abilities and strengths.
“Our goal has always been to make the game players really want, even if it means breaking the mould,” said Vela Games CEO and Co-Founder, Travis George. “With EVERCORE Heroes, we are building a unique multiplayer experience that brings together skill-based co-op and competitive play in a fresh new way. And after over two years of great feedback from early testing, we’re ecstatic to finally share the game with the world.&quot;

                              <span>Overwatch 2 has been out for a decent amount of time now, enough of a stretch for the vast number of players to hopefully get through the login queues and try the hero shooter out for themselves. While the gameplay changes (or lack thereof) remain a hot button topic right now among the community, it’s the new battle pass system that really has people riled up, with some even looking back at the loot boxes of Overwatch 1 with newfound fondness.
But what exactly is this new system and why has it got people mad. Well, Overwatch 2 has replaced the old method of unlocking new content — a combination of free and premium loot boxes that contained skins — with a traditional battle pass that has become all the rage over the past few years. This pass contains skins, sprays, voice lines and yes, even new heroes…
Let’s start with that final point, a real rough spot for some among the Overwatch 2 player base. If you buy the premium pass right now, you get the newest character (Kiriko) right away. Bam! However, if you stick to the free pass, you’ll need to progress through 55 levels of the system before you can play the featured hero. Considering Overwatch is an FPS focused around counterpicks and team composition, this isn’t too great for those who want to dive straight into competitive matches. Not to mention, new characters previously were given out for free.

                              <span>Lego Bricktales is the sort of game that would’ve been seismic to me as a child. Lego obsessed from the moment I held my first set, I’ve nevertheless felt that Lego video games have more often than not deliberately dodged or accidentally avoided the freedom of expression and creativity that these magical little bricks allow in the real world. When a game embraces that angle, it’s often gold, as was the case for many of the classic Lego games of the nineties. In Lego Bricktales, we finally have another such game – and it’s brilliant.

Bricktales is a clever, casual, and devilishly challenging experience. It’s a low-key genre mash-up bringing together puzzle-solving curios with light adventure and exploration elements. Rather than a franchise tie-in action game where the Lego aesthetic is… well, an aesthetic, here it’s at the heart of the experience: this is a game about building.

Bricktales essentially takes place inside small dioramas, many of which are based on classic Lego themes like Pirates, Castles, and Theme Parks. Your protagonist travels through this world with a superpower: the ability to build. Your job is to travel through each of the game’s stages by building items and structures that’ll help solve puzzles and open up new areas. Along the way, you’ll also acquire a few non-building abilities and tackle some light traversal puzzles.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is set to release in just a few weeks on October 8, alongside the Winter&#x27;s Expansion. With their release, many of us will be headed back to Village once more to see what Rose Winters is capable of in the Shadows of Rose DLC, or to go and fight hordes in Mercenaries.
In an interview with Polygon, game director Kento Kinoshita had plenty to say about Mercenaries, including exactly what it might feel like finally playing as every Resident Evil fan&#x27;s favourite vampire, Lady Dimitrescu.
Mercenaries will feature the playable debut of both Lady D and Karl Heisenberg, and when asked about adapting new characters for the game mode, Kinoshita shared, “When adapting them for The Mercenaries, we made a conscious effort to give each one their own distinct feel. Chris is a hybrid character that combines long-range attacks (firearms) with close-combat (fists). Meanwhile, Heisenberg wields magnetic force to unleash close-range assaults.”

                              <span>This morning, right on schedule, The Liquidators mid-season event kicked off in Battlefield 2042. This limited-time event introduced an infantry-only Conquest variant, and came with its own reward track and exclusive skins.
Unfortunately, DICE had to disable The Liquidators very shortly after it went live.
DICE broke the news on Twitter upon discovering major two major issues with the event. Players were not able to make progress or unlock event rewards, effectively invalidating their progress. The other bug doubles down by preventing players from being able to equip what they unlocked.

                              <span>It’s safe to say that Overwatch 2 hasn’t had the smoothest launch since its release on October 4. On launch, servers were at full capacity while simultaneously being hit with DDoS attacks, meaning it was a long wait to get into a game you might be disconnected from. 
Then, Blizzard removed its controversial SMS Protect system (for Overwatch 1 players) that was also locking out some players from jumping into all the action. There was a chat bug that saw players accidentally making purchases, and Bastion’s ultimate is completely broken.
Ultimately, Overwatch 2 is the latest in a long line of terrible game launches, beyond the initial grudges we had against the queues.

                              <span>Over at Walmart in the US, you can pick up a set of Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 Bluetooth PC speakers for $59, rather than the $95 they normally cost. This is a better deal than I expected to find for this model, which offer a small but powerful 100W subwoofer and two speakers with &#x27;exclusive horn-loaded tweeter technology&#x27;. No, I don&#x27;t know what that means either.

This was back when cereal had that Happy Meal generosity, and you&#x27;d look forward to that thump as a gift caked in dust landed in your bowl. You won&#x27;t find any game demos in those wheat crunchie crumbs anymore.
Definitely not one on the level of Action Man: Raid On Island X at least. It was the absolute business.

Well, now Activision Blizzard are planning to insist people sign up for two-factor authentication to play the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, too. They’re also warning that players with pre-paid plans might not be able to get the process to work.

I was lucky enough to go hands-on with an early build of the Wild Hearts&#x27;s opening hours to see how it stacks up against its age-old competitor, and whether it has any chance of melting down Monster Hunter&#x27;s trophy cabinet and forging itself a golden crown.

                              <span>Owners of Valve’s handheld PC Steam Deck have been fiddling about with creating and sharing their own ten-second animations for the machine’s new custom boot video feature, implemented in a client update last week. Some pay homage to Valve and Steam, while others nod towards games in general, or even classic telly and film. I’ve had a rummage around to help give you some ideas, and found the batch below.

                              <span>Phil Spencer&#x27;s shelf is at it again. Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft&#x27;s long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.


Spencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, &quot;Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary.&quot; Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that&#x27;s supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.


As described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was &#x27;pivoting away&#x27; from the then-current iteration to refocus on &quot;a new approach&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch has responded to its controversial decision not to amend its revenue split for streamers.


At present, that split is 50/50 between Twitch and streamers, unlike key competition like YouTube that favours streamers with a 70/30 split. In a lengthy blog post last month, Twitch explained why it won&#x27;t be amending this.



Then, at TwitchCon San Diego during the Patch Notes livestream, Twitch addressed the issue once again.

Players were also able to use the in-game character creation to make a custom fighter for the closed beta and so, unsurprisingly, people decided to experiment and see how far they could push those polygons.

And boy, did you all push them.

                              <span>Do we really need a Horizon Zero Dawn remake? That was the first topic on this week&#x27;s Digital Foundry Direct, as John, Rich and Alex grapple with the prospect of a PS5 remaster of a recently-released PlayStation 4 title. 
It&#x27;s a hard question to answer, as undoubtedly the team at Guerrilla Games wants their work to be playable at the best possible quality, but the 2017 PS4 release already runs well on PS5 thanks to a patch - and the PC edition from 2020 remains one of the best-looking games on the platform two years later. Creating a remake could be a good way for the developers to work on a PS5-only engine for future titles but that same development time could also be devoted to an entirely new Horizon game, albeit one that won&#x27;t result in an influx of cash for the company quite as soon. 
It&#x27;s an interesting point of discussion, and the rest of the spreadsheet that spawned the Horizon Zero Dawn remake rumour also makes for entertaining reading. There&#x27;s mention of a Horizon multiplayer &#x27;live service&#x27; game for PS5 and PC and a new Death Stranding, for example.

                              <span>Former and current employees have shared their experiences of working at Quantic Lab, a Romanian company which provides quality assurance (QA) support as an external third party.

Quantic Lab came under scruntiny in June when a YouTube video uploaded by channel Upper Echelon Gamers contained details of mismanagement and malpractice at the company while it was helping with development on Cyberpunk 2077. 

The allegations, shared with Upper Echelon Gamers by whistleblowers, were brushed off by Quantic Lab CEO and founder Stefan Seicarescu at the time.

This port from Simon Brown, aka DrBeef, features motion controlled lightsabers and the ability to deflect oncoming blasts - perfect for all your Storm Trooper slicing and dicing needs. I feel compelled to write something about how &quot;I thought they smelled bad on the outside...&quot; here.


Known as Jedi Knight: Quest, this first-person taster offers an amusing (and a very satisfying looking) way to make one&#x27;s way through that beloved galaxy far, far away.

                              <span>Those who are going to be diving into Modern Warfare 2 via PC on its launch will face the same problem as those going into Blizzard&#x27;s recently released Overwatch 2 - you will need to link a phone number to access the game, and mobile phones with a prepaid plan &quot;may not work&quot;.


If you head on over to the phone notifications page on the Battle.net support site, you will see the text stating that those playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, or those with &quot;newly created Overwatch 2 accounts, and newly created Call of Duty: Modern Warfare accounts&quot;, will be  required to add a phone number to access the game. 


The page continues: &quot;Adding a phone number will allow Blizzard Entertainment to send you notifications when important changes are made to your account. Any mobile phone in a supported country with a data plan, and that is not prepaid or a VOIP number, can be used with this service&quot; (thanks, PCGamer).

                              <span>Hey, did I ever mention that I got to play on the PSVR 2 recently? Because I did and I actually had a wonderful time playing demos of four upcoming PSVR2 games on Sony&#x27;s new  VR headset. Inspired by that preview session, on this week&#x27;s episode of VR Corner (above), I decided to dig into the ever-growing list of confirmed PSVR 2 titles and whittle it down to the 13 games I&#x27;m most excited to play. Fair warning, as this is my opinion only and it&#x27;s my favourite VR genre, there are a lot of shooters in there so shout outs to the runners up, Demeo and Ultrawings 2 that just missed out on making the cut for this list.
Firewall Ultra
So far details are light on what Firewall Ultra, the PSVR 2 exclusive follow up to Firewall Zero Hour has to offer in terms of new gameplay. However, the original was one of my all-time favourite PSVR titles and this tactical shooter delivered some superb Rainbow Six Siege style gameplay that just felt phenomenal to experience in VR. The sneak peeks of gampelay we’ve been shown in recent trailers have sent my anticipation levels into overdrive though. Not only are we bound to see much better visuals this time around, thanks to the PSVR2’s 4K HDR but (according to a splash screen at the end of the Firewall Ultra reveal trailer) the game will also take advantage of all the PSVR2’s new hardware features such as finger touch detection, foveated rendering, adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. Which means you’re actually going to feel it the next time you get shot in the head by the opposition!

                              <span>Why do people play healers in games? Where does that drive come from for someone to log in and want to help someone else instead of seeking glory of their own?


I&#x27;ve wondered about it ever since I started healing in Dark Age of Camelot 20 years ago. I don&#x27;t know why I did it or stuck with it, but in every game I play now, I gravitate towards that role. 


And having played healers for so long, I&#x27;ve seen the good and the bad of it. I&#x27;ve been moaned at, and I&#x27;ve been killed as a matter of priority by enemy teams more times than I can count. And let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s not always fun - not just for those reasons, but because healing isn&#x27;t the flashy stuff games are sold on.

                              <span>Good news everyone! You can now link together your Steam and PSN accounts. In case you’re not shaking in your boots, screaming and soiling yourself in hype, this means you can claim some super rad free stuff on PC versions of certain PlayStation titles. Snark and sarcasm aside, this marks the latest step in Sony’s invasion of the PC platform.
You want an example of some of the perks? How about Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles Morales buddy? If you link together your Steam and PSN accounts, you can claim some cosmetics and in-game bonuses including the Resilient Suit, and early unlock of the Concussive Blast, and two skills points. 
But what else does this mean, aside from Miles Morales players getting a nice little boost if they decide to pick up the game on the PC right now. Well, as briefly mentioned earlier, it’s a rather major milestone in Sony’s slow but steady trudge onto the platform. We’ve seen it make pushes here and there with services like PlayStation Now allowing you to play games like Bloodborne on PC for a while now, but this newfound connectivity adds some extra justification for porting over Sony’s biggest titles to the platform.

                              <span>Spooky season is upon us. The nights are drawing in, the smell of leaf mulch is in the air, and the clouds are stretching out across the sky, getting thinner and wider and seemingly further away – it all looks as if the barriers between the worlds are fading. 
It&#x27;s the perfect time, then, to stay indoors; watch the long autumn evenings drip into night from the safety of your sofa, where you&#x27;re all wrapped up with a mug of tea and your favourite spooky game. Maybe you&#x27;ll turn to an old classic – Resident Evil or Dead Space – and by the time you look outside again, there&#x27;s only the pale light of a harvest moon, illuminating the dead streets and frigid pavements of your road.
Perhaps you don&#x27;t want to get back into a classic, though – you&#x27;ve played through SOMA one too many times, maybe, and Alien: Isolation just isn&#x27;t cutting it for you anymore. So we&#x27;re here to help.

                              <span>^We&#x27;ve re-dubbed the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer with Charles Martinet&#x27;s voice work in order to give you a taste of what might have been. Stick around after the ads to hear the surprising results.


Many fans are outraged by the fact that the original voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, will not be bringing his classic take on the character to the silver screen. Instead, he&#x27;s been replaced by Hollywood superstar Chris Pratt, a move which many have dismissed as stunt casting, on the grounds that Chris Pratt isn&#x27;t Italian and famously doesn&#x27;t even like cured meats.

While Charles Martinet isn&#x27;t a Hollywood name (ask one of your normal mates about him and expect blank stares before a suggestion that he&#x27;s a footballer or something), he&#x27;s far from just the &quot;voice of Mario.&quot; He&#x27;s got quite a few voices, actually.

                              <span>In a recent interview with PCGamer, Nate Purkeypile gave many of us an insight into Bethesda’s upcoming RPG, Starfield. Nate has been a developer for 17 years, with 14 of those years being spent at Bethesda working on the likes of Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. 
Now, Nate is the founder of Just Purkey Games, spending time on smaller projects. While he, for rather obvious reasons, couldn’t share too much about Starfield, Nate did have some interesting things to say when it comes to working with Bethesda on Starfield.
When asked about just how big Starfield really is, it became clear that Starfield isn’t just a huge game, it has an even larger team behind it, too. “Starfield is a much bigger project, it’s like 500 people or something on the team, whereas I think [Fallout] 76 was maybe 200, tops,” said Nate.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players are coming under fire a tad more than usual right now, thanks to a bug that allows Bastion to infinitely shoot their ultimate until their ultimate timer runs out. While you’re usually only able to use it three times before you’re kicked out, this glitch allows Bastion mains in the know to unload shot after shot for up to eight seconds — more than enough time to clear out an objective or kill most of a team.
What’s worse is that it’s easily reproducible. To fire off a shot, you can use one of two inputs. The trick is to use your left click / right trigger for the first two shots, before pressing both inputs at the same time for each consecutive shot afterwards. On PC this means using left click and Q at the same time, although some have been rebinding their left click input to other keys to make the bug that much easier to reproduce.
The result? An otherwise underwhelming ultimate for a typical subpar Overwatch hero is currently causing havoc online. Regardless of your hero or what role you’re filling, an endless stream of high-damage shells is enough to wipe out anyone, and while eight seconds might not sound like a lot, it’s more than enough time to blow through the vast majority of the enemy team.

                              <span>This might sound like an unlikely crossover, but based on a recent leak, real life footballers might make an appearance in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.


As spotted by Insider Gaming, notable Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope recently shared a list of unreleased operators for Modern Warfare 2. Call of Duty leaks are a dime a dozen, but this one lists big name footballers like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and more as potential operators. TheGhostOfHope wasn&#x27;t able to elaborate on the leak, noting that they don&#x27;t have &quot;a clue why&quot; it&#x27;s a list of football player names.


The names could just be temporary placeholders, so there&#x27;s no guarantee that these footballers will be seen running and gunning around the place, though it would be an odd choice for some file names. Call of Duty isn&#x27;t exactly a stranger to odd collaborations, like when the series featured Godzilla and King Kong, or the Attack on Titan cosmetic pack.

This spot comes courtesy of deals wizard and news poster Wario64, who noticed that the Steam page for the System Shock remake appears to have been updated to say March 2023 (thanks, Eurogamer). An official announcement regarding a release date hasn&#x27;t been confirmed as of yet, but up until this point the game was expected to release sometime this year. Though considering how much of the year is left, a push to next year isn&#x27;t all that surprising.


Being developed by Nightdive Studios, the System Shock remake was born as a Kickstarter project way back in 2016, with an initial expected release date of 2017. That obviously never happened, with the game receiving numerous delays over the years, bringing us to now where it&#x27;s more of a &#x27;it&#x27;ll come out when it comes out&#x27; situation.

                              <span>MutliVersus game director, Tony Huynh, has made a habit of teasing or outright announcing future changes to the game via social media, a practice that has frankly established a strong link between the development team and the community over the past few months since launch. However, a recent Tweet has sent the community spiralling. Some, seemingly overjoyed! Others, very worried.
This change is a hard limit to the number of times you can use the same move in a combo, an effort to clamp down on “infinites”. These refer to combos that can — in theory — go on forever, unless the opposing player falls away from the blows or the attacking player suffers from a moment of input error. While current anti-infinite systems are in place, which drastically lowers the damage of repeated moves in the same combo, a hard combo breaker would drastically affect the ability to perform extended attack strings.
So, first things first, who does this affect the most? Well, certain characters have had long winded combos that use repeated moves  — and yes, even infinites — for some time now. Harley Quinn and Superman are the most prevalent, able to combo players from spawn to ludicrously high percentages and even straight up kills.

Moving on quickly from the bad pun, the Kickstarter for Zoo Tycoon: The Board Game is launching later this month, with a planned release of next year, being described as &quot;Your zoo in a box with more than 230 Animal Meeples. A highly thematic board game experience for 2-4 players&quot; (thanks Eurogamer). 


Like the video game, the board game will have you building &quot;a zoo that focuses on marquee animals like Lions, Gorillas, or Elephants to attract and thrill guests,&quot; as explained by publisher Treecer. &quot;Or develop partnerships with National Parks on conservation and reintroduce endangered species back into the wild.

                              <span>Another day, another person getting Doom running on something it was never intended to - this time, Notepad!


If I had a nickel for every weird place you&#x27;re able to play Doom, I&#x27;d probably have quite a few nickels, because people just seem incredibly determined to get it to run on anything they can get their hands on. Today, this particular nickel of mine comes from developer Samperson, who got Doom running on the note taking software Notepad (slight flashing warning in the example video seen below).


While it&#x27;s definitely one of the more unreadable versions of Doom, you have to admit when watching the video, this is in fact Doom. The game itself is obviously made up of a bunch of various characters lined up to resemble the visuals of Doom. It even sounds like Samperson got the audio and soundtrack working and synced up, which could not be anything but witchcraft.

                              <span>International regulators around the world are pouring over the finer details of the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger, and some of the information coming out of the enquries are fascinating. The most recent – and revealing – byte of data comes via TweakTown, and from Brazil&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), which has managed to finally shed some light on how much money Xbox Game Pass actually makes for Microsoft.
Per data shared with CADE, Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021 (not including Xbox Game Pass for PC). This is the first time we&#x27;ve seen data like this, and it sheds a light on how important the service is for Microsoft. 
Elsewhere, there&#x27;s more interesting data coming out of CADE – like the revelation that Xbox gaming generated an eye-watering total revenue of $16.28 billion for Microsoft in the 2021 calendar year.

However, skipping intervening releases does, in fact, often work quite well. Apparently, this is surprising to many people, even Debian insiders. I was encouraged to write about it some more.
My personal experience
I have three conventionally-managed personal server systems (by which I mean systems which aren’t reprovisioned by some kind of automation). Of these at least two have been skip upgraded at least once:
The one I don’t think I’ve skip-upgraded (at least, not recently) is my house network manager (and now VM host) which I try to keep to a minimum in terms of functionality a…</span>

After the talk, Franz Thoma approached me and told me a story of how we was once implementing the game Minesweeper in Haskell, and in particular the part of the logic where, after the user has uncovered a field, the game would automatically uncover all fields that are next to a “neutral” field, i.e. one with zero adjacent bombs.

                              <span>LaTeX — the age-old typesetting system — makes me angry. Not because it&#x27;s bad.
To clarify, not because there&#x27;s something better. But because there should
be.
When writing a document using LaTeX, if you are prone to procrastination
it can be very difficult to focus on the task at hand, because there are so
many yaks to shave. Here&#x27;s a few points of advice.
format the document source for legible reading. Yes, it&#x27;s the input
to the typesetter, and yes, the output of the typesetter needs to be
legible. But it&#x27;s worth making the input easy to read, too. Because…


avoid rebuilding your rendered document too often. It&#x27;s slow, it takes you
out of the activity of writing, and it throws up lots of opportunities to
get distracted by some rendering nit that you didn&#x27;t realise would happen.

iptables to be able to run and communicate different virtualization systems
and containers on laptops running Debian GNU/Linux.
I’ve used different variations of this setup for a long time with
VirtualBox and KVM for
the Virtual Machines and Linux-VServer,
OpenVZ, LXC and lately
Docker or Podman for the
Containers.
Required packages
I’m running Debian Sid with systemd and network-manager to configure the
WiFi and Ethernet interfaces, but for the bridge I use bridge-utils with
ifupdown (as I said this setup is old, I guess ifupdow2 and ifupdown-ng
will work too).
To start and stop the DNS and DHCP services and add NAT rules when the
bridge is brought up or down I execute a script that uses:

                              <span>Following the first trailer for the Super Mario Bros Movie, prolific voice actress Tara Strong has criticised the casting of the titular plumber.


To pretty much everyone&#x27;s horror, last year it was revealed that Chris Pratt would play Mario in Illumination&#x27;s adaptation of the beloved series. In one part, fans were unhappy that an actor that has been associated with a controversial church (which he later noted was not a church he attends, but in fact a different one that also isn&#x27;t great). But fans were also unhappy that Mario himself, Charles Martinet, would not be reprising his role. Like fans of the actor, fellow voice actress Tara Strong also doesn&#x27;t seem to be happy.


Strong, known for a huge number of roles, notably including multiple stints as Harley Quinn, and Fairly Odd Parent&#x27;s Timmy Turner, shared a photo of herself and Martinet with a caption that reads, &quot;It should be Charles,&quot; obviously in references to the recent release of the first trailer of the film.

                              <span>While it&#x27;s not a new video game announcement, Atlus has announced that Persona 5 Royal is getting a card game adaptation. 


The new card game based on Persona 5 Royal very specifically is being designed by Emerson Matsuuchi, and is being published by Pandasauras Games, announced on the publisher&#x27;s site. According to Matsuuchi, &quot;Players will take on the roles of their favorite Phantom Thieves and fight to change the world in this cooperative card-based strategy game,&quot; though other than that no other details were provided on what the game will actually be like.


Nathan McNair, co-owner of Pandasaura Games, also said, As a diehard fan of Persona 5 Royal – I cannot wait to bring the Palaces, Velvet Room and world of Persona 5 Royal onto tabletops everywhere in 2023.&quot; The game is apparently targeting a Q4 2023 release, which is anywhere between October and December, though oddly an image on the site does specify an October 21 release date, so it could be then, it could be later.

                              <span>After some speculation from fans, Deathloop director Dinga Bakaba confirmed that the game is in fact set in the same world as Dishonored.

Arkane&#x27;s games all tend to have some similarities here and there, being one of the few big developers to actually make immersive simulators, but Deathloop and Dishonored obviously shared some DNA in more obvious ways. But according to Deathloop&#x27;s director himself, the games are both in fact in the same world, something likely to please fans that have theorised as such.


Bakaba confirmed the connection on the most recent episode of the Xbox Podcast (thanks PCGamer), where he said that Deathloop is &quot;one of the futures of the Dishonored world.&quot; Asked directly about the connection, Bakaba noted how due to the nature of the game not everyone will see the same thing, &quot;so it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after Death of the Outsider.&quot;

                              <span>If you have a penchant for uncovered, orb-shaped body parts, Nintendo isn&#x27;t going to be in your good books.


Nintendo obviously has a pretty family-friendly image for the most part, so you&#x27;re unlikely to find scenes of a sexual nature in a Mario game. However, with the Nintendo Switch, some more risque games have made it onto the platform. According to one indie developer though, outright &quot;uncensored nudes,&quot; won&#x27;t be allowed on the eShop.


Publisher Gamuzumi recently confirmed that one of the games it&#x27;s publishing, Hot Tentacles Shoot, would not be coming to Switch for the time being (thanks, Nintendo Everything). According to Gamuzumi, the reason for the game not being allowed on the eShop is that &quot;obscene content could damage the brand and infringe its policies.&quot;

                              <span>It’s difficult to believe, but today marks ten years since XCOM: Enemy Unknown was first released. A lot has changed in the world of gaming in the ensuing decade ⁠— but for my money, Firaxis’ vision of a modern XCOM game remains the best video game franchise reboot there’s ever been. 
Still the high bar for a video game remake, Enemy Unknown reimagines 1994’s X-COM: UFO Defense, dropping the dash in the name and dragging this unique strategy game, originally developed by MicroProse, into the modern age.
What makes XCOM brilliant is honestly a matter of sorcery ⁠— or, perhaps chemistry, if we’re being a little less romantic. The point is this: XCOM: Enemy Unknown is that rare pitch perfect game that threads the needle that any video game remake or reboot faces brilliantly. It kept that which made the original a beloved and fondly remembered cult classic, but took informative cues and ideas from games released in the interim. Many games have tried this, of course, but few have been so resoundingly successful at making it all work.

Be careful if you spot anything about Gotham Knights online, as there&#x27;s a chance it could be a major plot spoiler. This has apparently come from an early release of the game&#x27;s artbook (thanks, Eurogamer), which is obviously unfortunate for those who might have already seen spoilers.


This in turn has led to Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty to express frustration at sharing spoilers. &quot;I can&#x27;t begin to understand why would anyone spoil a story (whether it&#x27;s a game, a movie, a book, whatever) for others,&quot; wrote Marty on her personal Twitter account.

                              <span>Babylon&#x27;s Fall might have been a failure, but PlatinumGames still intends to have a focus on live service games.


Last month, PlatinumGames delivered the news that the servers for Babylon&#x27;s Fall would be shutting down, and as it&#x27;s an online-only game, that means it&#x27;s going away forever. This wasn&#x27;t particularly surprising news considering a few months ago the game literally only had one player online on Steam at one point. But in a new interview from VGC, the studio&#x27;s CEO Atsushi Inaba hasn&#x27;t changed its plans to progress with more live service titles (thanks, Eurogamer).


&quot;Live service games are definitely something we do want to do and put our effort in moving forward,&quot; Inaba said. &quot;There are two pillars, so to speak, that we can look at internally for our development teams, that being the people within the same company.

                              <span>Splatoon 3&#x27;s next Splatfest is set to ask the age old question: which Pokémon starter type are you going to choose?


As announced on the official Nintendo UK Twitter account, the second Splatfest coming to the threequel is Pokémon themed, where you&#x27;ll either pick grass-, fire-, or water-type. This particular Splatfest is obviously coinciding with the release of Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, and kicks off at 1am UK time November 12, running until November 14, again at 1am, giving you a full 48 hours to splat your friends.


The announcement didn&#x27;t note which types will be assigned to which Deep Cut member, so hopefully your favourite type doesn&#x27;t get attached to your least favourite member (as if there it&#x27;s possible to have a least favourite). Artwork paired with the announcement shows the three types with a little silhouette of the new three starters, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and best-duck Quaxly, too.

                              <span>It looks like a new Crash Bandicoot game is set to be revealed at The Game Awards, as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time gets a Steam release.


Earlier this week, a selection of press and influences received a Crash Bandicoot-themed pizza box that contained stuff like a t-shirt and charging cables, mostly innocuous merch for the most part, as detailed by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks GamesRadar). On the box the Crash 4 Steam release was teased with the text &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-in Pizza Shack,&quot; before just outright saying it&#x27;s coming to the store October 18. But a teaser on the side of the box is potentially hinting at the reveal of the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League.


If you haven&#x27;t heard of Wumpa League before, there have been rumours surrounding the game for quite a while, with some concept art for the game having been shared earlier this year by DidYouKnowGaming&#x27;s Liam Robertson. The reason some suspect that Wumpa League will be revealed at The Game Awards is a line of text on the side of the box that reads, &quot;Hungry for more? Try our new wumpa pizza for $12.08!&quot;

Slated to release next year, the 2-4 player game tasks participants in building &quot;the most successful zoo&quot; in a new strategic and thematic board game that features over 34 species, &quot;most of them represented by 230 beautiful animal meeples&quot;. 

With a Kickstarter launching later this month, the creator says &quot;each game you play will be different, delivering high replay value thanks to a novel game mechanism&quot;.

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Chris Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.

In a tweet, Strong - whose own prolific career includes voice performances as Harley Quinn, Batgirl, and Fairly Odd Parents&#x27; Timmy Turner - posted a photograph of herself and Martinet with the text: &quot;it should be Charles&quot;.

&quot;The limited-edition prints are museum-grade quality, using only the best quality paper and archival inks to ensure longevity. All works are available for purchase unframed, or with a high-quality frame or finish,&quot; Cook and Becker said.

As shared on the Overwatch subreddit community, Dracyoshi reports that whilst &quot;chatting with some friends while browsing the hero gallery&quot;, the game &quot;unexpectedly began unlocking Junnker Queen&#x27;s Plutonium skin&quot;.

As they&#x27;d been writing a message in chat at the time, they weren&#x27;t able to cancel the purchase before it completed.

                              <span>Over the last ten years, I&#x27;ve interviewed many of my childhood heroes - those talented coders I used to read about in the pages of Crash or Your Sinclair. But today is different, because back in 1982, not only did Kevin Toms create a smash hit game, he invented a whole new genre. 


&quot;Conceptually, it was very different to most games,&quot; he explains to me via Skype. &quot;At ZX shows, I had to constantly explain it was a football management game, and they&#x27;d go, &#x27;oh, okay&#x27;.&quot; Often confused for some sort of weird text adventure, it was an abstruse concept for many - but not its author. &quot;I already had the idea for the board game,&quot; explains Toms. &quot;So I just thought a computer could do that, too.&quot;



From a young age, Toms harboured dreams of having a career in tabletop games. &quot;When I was 15, my parents had to see the careers master at school,&quot; he says. &quot;I asked them to ask him if it was possible to get a job as a board game designer.&quot; The inevitable reply came back. &quot;He said it was a phase and that I&#x27;d grow out of it.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s official Xbox controllers, whether from the Series or One generations, are an awesome gamepad for PC gaming too. By default though, your options for connecting the controller are Bluetooth (on later models) or a wired USB connection - rather than the low-latency 2.4GHz wireless you get on Xbox consoles, which requires Microsoft&#x27;s $25 Wireless Adapter for Windows. That adapter is down to $18 at Newegg today, and is well worth picking up while it&#x27;s discounted.

                              <span>One of the things you can do with a Steam Deck is use it for emulation. Someone at Valve is evidently aware of this, given the recent Steam Deck video - which we wrote about two days ago - contained a shot of a Steam library with a Nintendo Switch emulator in it.

Oops. Valve have since deleted and re-uploaded the video with the emulator removed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there&#x27;s usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn&#x27;t happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn&#x27;t crash.

                              <span>Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

This GP66 Leopard is one of the fastest gaming laptops on the market, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD and a 144Hz screen - not to mention that flagship-grade graphics card. 
It normally retails for a cool £1998, but today Laptops Direct has discounted it to £1399.97, making it the cheapest RTX 3080 laptop we can find right now.

                              <span>Valve has released an updated video for Steam Deck after the company realized the original trailer featured an icon for the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu.
The company released the new Steam Deck trailer earlier this week to promote the fact you no longer needed a reservation to order one.
Spotted by eagle-eyed Nibellion (thanks, PC Gamer), you can clearly see the icon for the emulator on the Steam Deck screen in the video. Nibel&#x27;s tweet was eventually seen by Valve, and the company quickly set the video to private and issued a new trailer.

                              <span>The rumor that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake is true, according to film director Christophe Gans.
Speaking in an interview with French outlet MaG - Movie &amp; Game (thanks, ResetEra, via IGN) the Silent Hill movie director claimed that multiple games are in the works from several teams at Konami.
Gans said he is working with the same Silent Hill team he worked with on the first film in the franchise, which we assume is how he gained the information.

Fall is here, and the air is crisp, the leaves are changing color, and Halloween is just around the corner. While the weather may be more pleasant, you may just want to open the windows and enjoy the breeze while you play a few games.
That&#x27;s what we will be doing anyway, and here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re getting into this weekend.

Though not formally confirmed by the developer Nightdive Studios, Steam has updated the game&#x27;s store listing to reveal a March 2023 release date and pre-orders are now open. 

The upcoming release was also spotted and shared by industry insider, Wario64, although some commenters were unsure if this is a real, concrete release date or just an end-of-year placeholder. Guess we&#x27;ll find out in March, eh?

&quot;The next few months mark the road to the Brelshaza Legion Raid — one of the most challenging, unique, and beautifully dangerous raids in all of Lost Ark,&quot; the team explains.

That&#x27;s according to developer Krafton, which says update 20.1 – which goes live on 11th October for PC and 19th for consoles and introduces a new ranked season – includes &quot;several improvements to weapon attachments, as well as updates to firing from vehicles, a new ranked season, world and map updates and quality-of-life updates&quot;. 

In response to the Vertical Foregrip &quot;dominating the battlegrounds as the choice grip slot attachment&quot;, the team is changing the Thumbgrip, Angled Foregrip, Halfgrip, Lightweight Grip - and the Vertical Foregrip itself - in a bid to shake things up, promising to &quot;monitor [our] plays after this balance update&quot;.

                              <span>Valve has deleted a Steam Deck promotional video - which, at the time of writing, can still be viewed embedded in this story - after eagle-eyed viewers spotted a Nintendo Switch emulator lurking in the library.

Yuzu is open-source and, crucially, legal, but as PC Gamer points out, emulation is a sticky topic for some, prompting Valve to upload an emulator-free version of the same video a short while later, which you can see below: 

&quot;Valve&#x27;s new official video for the Steam Deck has a very interesting game icon in it,&quot; industry insider Nibel tweeted yesterday, before following up with: &quot;Update: Valve has removed the original video and reuploaded a new one with a small difference.&quot;

                              <span>Another day, another Silent Hill story: this one purports, yet again, that there are &quot;several teams&quot; working on &quot;several games&quot;, including &quot;the Silent Team&quot; who were around when the first Silent Hill film was made in 2006. 

Christophe Gans, the director of the first Silent Hill movie - who we already knew was reportedly working on a third Silent Hill film - made the surprisingly candid revelations during a recent interview in which he seemingly confirmed the persistent whispers that there&#x27;s more than one Silent Hill game in development, including one by a central internal Konami team.

His interview also definitively confirms that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake, several games are in development, he hasn&#x27;t worked with Kojima, and he &quot;knows a bit about&quot; the next upcoming game.

                              <span>Playing a video game is a deeply personal experience. Unlike other mediums, you&#x27;re in control of what happens. I&#x27;m not just talking about making choices in an RPG, but the way every single press of a button or tilt of a stick adds up to make your playthrough different from mine. While we always bring something of ourselves to books, movies or albums, the core text never changes. Unless you decide to cut up a novel and then stick the pages together in the wrong order or something.


You can watch someone else play a game, and there are now more ways to do so than ever, but it&#x27;s not the same as poking around in someone else&#x27;s game, something I&#x27;d never given any thought to. Not until I saw a message on Twitter asking for help with Elden Ring. This person, who I&#x27;m going to call Sellen, because they asked to be anonymous and it&#x27;s the first Elden Ring NPC name that sprang to mind, had messed up their Elden Ring save game. They&#x27;d accidentally killed an NPC that they very much did not want to kill and were quite distraught. They shared that save with their partner and didn&#x27;t want to potentially ruin the game for them.


Sellen was offering to pay someone to recreate their Elden Ring save, but without the unfortunate death of poor Jar Bairn. I can totally understand why, as young JB is an adorable little example of Elden Ring&#x27;s fascinating pot people. Paying someone to play a game for you may seem strange, but after chatting with them privately, I discovered that they were both busy folks with little time to play games. While they&#x27;d only played the game for sixteen hours or so, that represented a couple of months of shared time that would be hard to get back. Intrigued by the challenge recreating their save presented, I accepted the oddest commission of my freelance career so far.

BASIC

evalfilter

Monkey

TCL

Each of these works in similar ways, and each of these filled a minor niche, or helped me learn something new.  But of course there&#x27;s always a question:
Which is fastest?
In the real world?  It just doesn&#x27;t matter.  For me.  But I was curious, so I hacked up a simple benchmark of calcu…</span>

                              <span>Ever since the release of Deathloop last year, fans have speculated that the acclaimed time loop shooter was, in fact, set in the same universe as Arkane Studios&#x27; much-loved Dishonored series - and now theorists can given finally themselves a pat on the back and pack away their cork boards: the developer has confirmed it is indeed so.


Creative director Dinga Bakaba broke the news during the latest episode of the Xbox podcast (thanks PC Gamer), confirming that Deathloop is &quot;one of the futures of the Dishonored world.&quot;


When asked directly about the possible connection between the two games, Bakaba explained, &quot;We have a number of systems [that mean] not everyone has seen the same thing [in Deathloop], not everyone has heard the same song hidden somewhere, not everyone has seen every room. So it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after [the third Dishonored game] Death of the Outsider.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like the end of 2022 is going to have more than a whiff of Crash Bandicoot about it. Not only has Activision confirmed an 18th October Steam release date for the well-recieved Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, it seems the publisher might just be gearing up to unveil the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League at this year&#x27;s Game Awards.


All this news comes via a bit of promotional tat Activision has been sending out to influencers and press, taking the form of Crash-themed pizza box with goodies inside.


As detailed in a video by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks Games Radar), the promotional pizza box in question comes emblazoned with the words &#x27;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-in Pizza Shack&#x27;, a not too subtle hint that the formerly Battle.net-exclusive PC version of Crash Bandicoot 4 will (as fans had already surmised) soon be making its way to Valve&#x27;s storefront. And to clear up any doubt, that&#x27;s made explicit by an attached label confirming an 18th October Steam release.

                              <span>As the nights start drawing in and the spectre of Halloween looms on the horizon, Planet Zoo is getting just a little bit spooky with the announcement of its new nocturnal-themed Twilight Pack DLC, launching on 18th October.


The big draw of Planet Zoo&#x27;s DLC is always its creature addtions, and the Twilight Pack brings five new nocturnal species: the Racoon, Red Fox, Common Wombat, Striped Skunk, and Egyptian Fruit Bat. The first four of those are free-roaming, meaning you can plop them wherever you please, while the Egyptian Fruit Bat is restricted to a walkthrough exhibit.


Players looking to infuse their zoos with a touch of gothic flair for Halloween can make use of the Twilight Pack&#x27;s 200 new scenery items, ranging from castle-themed building parts - including gargoyles and an imposing portcullis - to glowing pumpkins and cauldrons. Even the flora is getting a bit spooky, with Bristlecone pine trees, ivy, and bioluminescent ghost fungus.

                              <span>Specifically designed mechanical boards for Macs have long been neglected, apart from little-known Matias keyboards or Apple&#x27;s own Mac keyboards in the 80s. Enter Das Keyboard to redress the balance with the amusingly named MacTigr. This keyboard offers a full Mac layout, mechanical switches, a volume knob and plenty of creature comforts - but is it worth its exorbitant $219 asking price? 
First, my credientials: as someone that splits their time between Windows and MacOS, I&#x27;ve been agitating for a proper dedicated MacOS keyboard to swap to. For too long Mac users have been lumbered with the runts of the litter when it comes to keyboards - the current selection is generally awash with non-mechanical options with mushier keys and less consistent key action - even Apple&#x27;s own Magic Keyboards aren&#x27;t all that magic. So, the MacTigr has the potential to deliver a considerable upgrade, with the functionality that Mac users rely on and the mechanical switches they don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re missing.
The MacTigr is a board that offers the traditional Mac layout, odd function keys and all, in a clean and sharp-looking package. The outer casing is comprised almost entirely of metal with a steel top plate and aluminium casing, which means the MacTigr features plenty of heft - it weighs in at 2.4lbs, or just over a kilo for metric users. It&#x27;s remarkably well made, with no signs of deck flex in the case, even under intense typing load, and feels excellent. Despite that heft though, the MacTigr is especially slim and modern looking, especially thanks to its use of MX Low Profile switches, more of which I&#x27;ll talk about in a moment.

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s big new 4.0 update - now officially titled Waypoint - is finally out in the wild. But while developer Hello Games broke from tradition for this latest releases, revealing some of its additions ahead of launch, the studio has now shared some extremely lengthy patch notes, discussing its contents in considerably more granular detail.


The top-level stuff we already knew about; as Hello Games boss Sean Murray told Eurogamer earlier this week, Waypoint - which arrives alongside a new Switch port for No Man&#x27;s Sky - is less about big new additions and more about major quality of life improvements.


To that end, Hello Games had previously teased a bunch of rejigging and streamlining intended to turn No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s last six years of updates &quot;into a more cohesive whole&quot;, as well as a new, less grindy Relaxed mode, a Survival mode revamp, plus extensive options for custom games.

                              <span>This is a quick public service announcement for those keen to avoid any spoilers for the upcoming release of Gotham Knights.


There are currently some major plot spoilers making their way around the internet, following the apparent early release of the game&#x27;s artbook.


I will not go into details of what they are here, I am sure if you are keen to know more you will be able to find out exactly what it is that has been revealed prematurely, but this leak has caused Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer to take to Twitter to complain about spoilers in general.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Overwatch 2 week but not quite the week Blizzard will have imagined. The servers haven&#x27;t worked, there are huge queues to play in the evening, and even when people can log in, there are overly complicated character unlock systems and bolshy Battle Passes to contend with. It&#x27;s not entirely clear what&#x27;s new in this second game when you can play it, either.

Overwatch 2 is overwhelmingly Overwatch. It&#x27;s the same conclusion Edwin Evans-Thirlwell came to in a quick impressions piece published this week while he works on his full review. And it&#x27;s hard not to agree with him. Faced with the same maps and the same characters, Overwatch 2 feels like the same game so many of us will have played so many times before. The differences are there, though, and given time, they make themselves felt. 


Overwatch 2 is the talking point of the week, then, and I&#x27;ve invited Edwin onto Weekly to talk about it. My other guest this week is news reporter Victoria Kennedy, who joins us to talk about Gotham Knights, Moonbreaker and CD Projekt Red as well.

This includes shooting missiles at a giant robot, as you can see in the trailer below (FYI, it is all oddly sensual).

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Nier Automata is one of the most celebrated last-generation action titles, marrying Platinum Games&#x27; signature stylings with inventive, varied gameplay and a mind-bending narrative. From a technical perspective though, the situation was far from ideal: the game was beset by frame-rate and image quality issues on last-gen machines, with wobbly performance coupled with plenty of aliasing. This is why the Switch port came as a bit of a surprise when it was announced a few months ago: there&#x27;s a huge performance gap between the Switch and even the base last gen consoles with precious little room to cut resolution before image quality becomes unacceptably poor. This seems like one of the so-called &quot;impossible ports&quot; - a technically demanding title downscaled for Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console, often with somewhat mixed results. 


The challenge is clear - and it&#x27;s all down to just how difficult this game was to run on PS4 and Xbox One. Despite relatively pedestrian visuals, the title targeted 900p without any anti-aliasing, with somewhat messy performance on both machines. The typical run of play was 40-60fps, with combat and open-world traversal causing issues. It&#x27;s important to keep this relatively poor showing in mind, because the Nintendo Switch falls far short of those machines in raw number-crunching performance. So what kind of compromises are we seeing here? 


Relative to base last-gen consoles, the Switch release is comprehensively downgraded - though the overall image still looks surprisingly comparable. Measuring the game against its Xbox One S counterpart, the first thing that stands out is a significant reduction in texture detail. Across the board, textures are degraded, with lower resolutions not to mention simplified layers and material properties. In some areas, the textures look soupy, with no fine detail to speak of, though most of the time it&#x27;s not quite as severe.

In a move that is sure to rile up the gaming community, the three options this time are starter Pokémon: are you grass type, fire type, or water type?


The Splatfest will take place in-game from the 11th November.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Platinum Games made the decision to cease all updates to its beleaguered live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall, and announced it would be  &quot;terminating the game&#x27;s service&quot; on Tuesday, 28th February 2023. The game itself had received a poor reception across the board, with criticisms ranging from its monetisation model to its £60 price tag.


However, despite the fall of Babylon&#x27;s Fall, the developer is not taking its eyes off any future live service games. 


In an interview with VGC, Platinum Games boss Atsushi Inaba said the team has &quot;learned from this experience [with Babylon&#x27;s Fall]&quot; and it had not &quot;changed [its] future plans or outlook&quot; because of it.

                              <span>Core members of the Disco Elysium team were &quot;fired under false premises&quot;, Martin Luiga has claimed in a new interview.

Luiga, one of the co-founders of the studio ZA/UM, originally stated the three leads had left &quot;involuntarily&quot;.

Designer Robert Kurvitz, one of the developers affected, later confirmed that he, along with writer Helen Hindpere and art director Aleksander Rostov, was no longer working at the studio.

                              <span>It&#x27;s finally here. Well over four years after we found out that Nintendo was partnering with Illumination for a Super Mario Bros. movie, last night gave us our first glimpse of the partnership and it was... interesting.
From Illumination&#x27;s rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom through to Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser, Keegan Michael-Key&#x27;s Toad, Charlie Day&#x27;s Luigi and - of course - Chris Pratt&#x27;s not-so-novel take on Mario, there&#x27;s a lot to unpack. So here&#x27;s what Team Eurogamer made of the big Super Mario Bros. movie reveal.

So, after a lot of hype from a certain Mr. Chris Pratt, who assured us this trailer would blow our minds, we finally got the new teaser for Illumination&#x27;s upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie and, I have to say, I kind of loved it.

A new QR code was found at the PAX Aus gaming convention, with the enigmatic words &quot;where am I?&quot; written across its front. The code was found next to a poster of the same cryptic silhouette.


Scanning this code then leads to a new website and a picture of, yes, Elle Fanning looking back at you, as you can see below from the shot I took on my phone when I scanned the QR code for myself.

A post on the Lodestone blog advises on precautions for guarding against unauthorised account access, including resetting your Square Enix password.



&quot;We are currently experiencing an attack by a third party that is attempting to gain access to the Square Enix Account Management System by using a combination of email addresses and passwords that appear to have been obtained from other online services of other companies,&quot; reads the post.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve read much about the new Batman game, Gotham Knights. I&#x27;ll call it a Batman game for simplicity&#x27;s sake. The truth is - as far as we&#x27;ve been told - this is actually a Batman game in which you don&#x27;t play as Batman. Batman&#x27;s dead, so instead you play as four members of the wider Bat family. In fact, this is probably what you&#x27;ve been reading about if you have been reading about the game.


This is all super interesting, I think. Gotham Knights is already a Batman game not made by Rocksteady, and now it doesn&#x27;t have the main character either - as far as we&#x27;ve been told. I&#x27;m intrigued to see the results, but the whole discussion has also made me think about the first Batman game in this series, Arkham Asylum, and how you definitely play as Batman in that - except when it comes to  my very favourite moment in the game, which is also the point at which the relationship between player and onscreen avatar becomes a little more complicated.


Firstly, yes, a lot of games complicate this relationship. You control the characters in GTA, for example, but when you&#x27;re driving to a mission they&#x27;re talking, and they&#x27;re saying stuff that is probably a surprise to you, the player, so there&#x27;s that gap there to ponder. You are the people on the screen, and you must be, because you tell them when to duck, when to reload. But they have a sliver of life that you will never quite get control of, because if you did, the game&#x27;s narrative wouldn&#x27;t work.

Last night, Nintendo showed a teaser trailer for the film, but Peach didn&#x27;t feature at all.


But in McDonalds adverts - most of which have been removed from social media, confirming their legitimacy - Peach is present alongside Mario and Toad.

But this trailer was not only shared in English (the version you can see below). Universal has also been uploading this trailer to its many YouTube channels, meaning we can hear just how Toad, Kamek and the rest of those in the Mushroom Kingdom (that we have seen so far at least) sound in Spanish, Italian and more.


First up, as this one has been garnering a lot of attention on Twitter, here is the French version of Mario making his way to the Mushroom Kingdom. Or, in this case, the Royaume Champignon.

                              <span>Cevat Yerli, the controversial founder and former boss of Crysis and CryEngine developer Crytek, has resurfaced - and he&#x27;s making virtual meeting software. 


Yerli left Crytek in 2018 after more than two decades, following a turbulent period where the company struggled to stay afloat and left some staff for months without pay.


He&#x27;s now developing Room, software designed to create &quot;lifelike virtual meetings&quot;, built on a new &quot;real-time AI 3D engine&quot;. Yerli is serving as chairman and CEO of its developer, TMRW Foundation.

                              <span>A new music pack is now available in Beat Saber that adds Lizzo&#x27;s anthemic hits.


The VR rhythm laser sword game has been adding plenty of new music and features to the game since it launched back in 2019 - this Lizzo pack follows the Lady Gaga pack released at the end of last year.


It&#x27;s available across Meta Quest, Steam, and PlayStation, with a discount on the first two stores - prices vary across the three.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
One of the things I am always up for in a video game is mountain climbing. Mountain climbing, rock climbing, bouldering. These are the things I wish I did in real life. It&#x27;s the video game as wish fulfilment.

                              <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, is getting a third paid expansion, titled Biotech - which&#x27;ll be bringing babies, mechanoids, and gene modding when it launches later this month alongside a free content update for all players.


Biotech&#x27;s first big additions come in the form of children and reproduction, with colonists and outsiders able to get pregnant and give birth - either naturally or via technological means.


Once babies grow into children, they can learn through lessons, play, or by watching adults work, with players able to determine their traits and passions every few years. Children given more attention and better education are more likely to become happy and talented adult colonists - but players can alternatively skip the nuturing and use growth vats to pump out soldiers and cheap workers to exploit.

In our reports we try to outline the most important things that we have been up to over the past month. As a quick recap, whilst anyone may inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users as pre-compiled binaries.

                              <span>In November 2021 I filed a feature request for the fish shell to add underscore as a thousand separator in
numbers. My feature request has been implemented and is available
in fish 3.5.0, released 16 June 2022.
The fish shell supports mathematical operations using the math command.

The underscore can be used as a thousand separator, but there are other uses for a number separator. Here&#x27;s a list taken
from a post by Mathias Bynens about the number separator in JavaScript:
// A decimal integer literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
1_000_000_000_000
// A decimal literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
1_000_000.220_720
// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per octet:
0b01010110_00111000
// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per nibble:
0b0101_0110_0011_1000
// A hexadecimal integer literal with its digits grouped by byte:
0x40_76_38_6A_73
// A BigInt literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
4_642_473_943_484_686_707n 



Programming languages are gradually adding a number separator to their syntax, I think Perl was the first. Most are
languages use underscore, but C++ 14 uses an apostrophe for the number separator.</span>

                              <span>Version 0.3.14 of the Rblpapi package arrived on CRAN earlier today. Rblpapi provides a direct interface between R and the Bloomberg Terminal via the C++ API provided by Bloomberg (but note that a valid Bloomberg license and installation is required).
This is the fourteenth release since the package first appeared on CRAN in 2016. It comprises a nice PR from Robert Harlow extending support to B-PIPE authentication (for those who have it) along with a few fixes made since the last release in January. The last one provided from a kind assist by Tomas Kalibera who pointed out how to overcome an absolute ‘rpath’ dynamic linker instruction (and as I noticed noticed something I already did in another package – ah well) so that we no longer require StagedInstall: yes.
The detailed list of changes follow below.
Changes in Rblpapi version 0.3.14 (2022-10-05)
Build configuration was generalized to consider local copies of library and headers (Dirk in #362)


A ticker symbol was corrected (Dirk in #368 addressing an issue #366 and #367)


Support for B-PIPE was added (Robert Harlow in #369 closing #342)


The package no longer requires staged installation thanks to an assist from Tomas Kalibera (Dirk in #373)


The retired package fts is no longer suggested (Dirk in #374 closing #372)



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for the this release. As always, more detailed information is on the Rblpapi page. Questions, comments etc should go to the issue tickets system at the GitHub repo.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

                              <span>A new trailer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been released, showing how spiffy the game looks running on PC.
The game features 4K and Ultrawide support and boasts over 500 customization options.
Other than what was provided for the beta, information on minimum and recommended specs at release have yet to be posted. But with the trailer out for the platform, we suspect a list to be provided rather soon. It is out on October 28, after all.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok has gone gold, which means it&#x27;s being pressed at the manufacturer as we speak.
It&#x27;s been a bit of a wait, so we&#x27;re happy to hear the release is getting close.
A sequel to God of War (2018), the ninth installment in the series finds Kratos and his son Atreus facing a series of events that bring about the end of days and the deaths of some of the Norse gods. Basically, Ragnarok.

The first tease from Kojima appeared at TGS 2022 back in September, with a poster featuring a silhouette with the face obscured and the words &quot;Who AM I&quot; printed across it (thanks, Polygon).
At PAX Australia, which is going on now, a QR Code is present that when scanned leads to an image posted on the Kojima Productions website showing an image of Elle Fanning (The Great) with the same words printed on it.

                              <span>Saving your game shouldn’t be so stressful. Getting to a Registration Point and operating the key card-activated, payphone like system – it takes seconds. But seconds are precious. Especially when there’s something, somewhere nearby, lurking. Waiting. Breathing. Watching. You’re pressing the skin of your face to the inside of a locker, eyeing up that terminal, knowing it’s less than 20 feet away, probably. But, moments ago, you heard the telltale ding of sinew on metal. The Xenomorph is nearby. And it’s waiting for you to make your move.

Time is running out. Both in the game, and in your real life – you need to save, and get on with that article you’re supposed to be writing. So you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and try to slink out of the little cupboard you’ve crammed yourself into as quietly as possible. A glance at your motion tracker seems to suggest you’re safe. Footsteps echoing through the deserted Sevastopol station. Breath ragged in your ears. The blinking light of the terminal closing in. Your hand on the machine. Then – fuck – it’s coming up and out of your chest. Its tail, tearing through your ribs, your lungs. That’s it. Game over, Ripley. 
Some may argue that this is appalling game design, making you gamble on whether or not you can actually save your game. You can lose hours of progress if you mess up your timing, if you gamble against Ripley’s ability to stay alive. But I think it perfectly encapsulates what makes Alien: Isolation one of the best games, ever. Even saving your game makes you think about survival – makes you think about death.

                              <span>Square Enix has warned Final Fantasy 14 players of a hacking attempt and suggests everyone with an account change their passwords.
According to the company, it is currently experiencing an attack by a third party attempting to gain access to the Square Enix Account Management System. They are doing this by using a combination of email addresses and passwords possibly obtained from “online services of other companies.&quot;
Square advises against using the same email address and password combination for your Square Enix account as you do for other online services, as it increases the possibility of a third party gaining unauthorized access to your account. That said, you are still at a high risk of your account being accessed should your password contain an easy pattern, sequences of characters, or your DOB.

                              <span>Electronic Arts has released its EA app for Windows out of beta, and it is now available for all to download.
The app will replace Origin, the PC platform EA introduced over 10 years ago. The app, according to EA, is &quot;faster, more reliable, and more streamlined&quot; than Origin, and will be the &quot;best possible place&quot; to experience the company&#x27;s games, services and content.
With the app, you can automatically download games and background updates, and build your friends list by connecting your EA account to other platforms and services like Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. Each user will also have a custom and unique ID, and once connected to the app, users will know what and when friends are playing, allowing players to jump in and game together.

                              <span>^Stay tuned after the ads for my full RAILGRADE review and enjoy some beautiful ultrawide footage while you’re at it.


It’s not often that video games set out to mimic small things. Photorealism tends to depict the world at a scale that humans can walk around in. But, swivelling a macro-lens onto that Unreal Engine camera and pointing it at digital miniatures produces a wonderful effect that makes RAILGRADE’s otherwise fairly standard route plan puzzling an absolute joy to get stuck into.


In short, it’s transportive. For me, it throws me right back to my childhood bedroom, where a constantly reconfigured TOMY train set enjoyed permanent residence on the floor, forever delivering assorted handfuls of lego bricks between the Ghostbusters fire station and a permanently downed Star Trek: The Next Generation shuttlecraft. Who knows why. The mind of a ten year-old is unknowable, even if you were one.

                              <span>Just a few days ago, Hello Games’ Sean Murray detailed what No Man’s Sky 4.0 update would look like in an interview with PCGamer. We’re already well aware of what’s in store, and that’s various adjustments to make the game welcoming for newcomers or returning players, or simply more engaging for veterans who believe they’ve done it all.
This includes a relaxed mode, and a survival mode, both of which offer easier and harder difficulties depending on what type of player you are. On top of that, there’s performance improvements, increased inventory space, and of course, perhaps the biggest accompaniment of the whole 4.0 update, the space-exploration title has finally arrived on Nintendo Switch.
That said, those playing the game on Nintendo Switch will not only be able to explore the vast expanse of space with responsive touch controls in handheld mode, they’ll also be able to bag themselves some freebies for supporting Hello Games’ survival game on the handheld.

                              <span>Do you ever think about the time before mobile phones? The era of calling your the landline in your mate&#x27;s house, only for their mum to answer.
 

&quot;Can I talk to Jimmy, please?&quot; 

&quot;Is that Tom? OK, I&#x27;ll get Jimmy.&quot; 

&quot;... JIMMY! JIMMY! TOM IS ON THE PHONE.&quot; 

&quot;Hello.&quot; 

&quot;Hello. Do you want to come round my house?&quot; 

&quot;... MUM! CAN I GO ROUND TOM&#x27;S HOUSE?&quot; 

&quot;... ARE YOU HAVING TEA THERE?&quot; 

&quot;Mum says am I having tea there?&quot; 

&quot;... MUM, CAN JIMMY HAVE TEA HERE?&quot; 

&quot;... YES.&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;OK.&quot; 

&quot;OK.&quot; 

&quot;Bye.&quot;

We had such wonderful conversations on phones, before everything became texts and WhatsApp messages.

                              <span>EGX was two weeks ago, which is wild. Time has really flown by. But, there’s one game there that’s really stuck in my mind as of late — especially as I&#x27;ve been kicking my heels in Overwatch 2 queues and looking for a quick, competitive FPS fix in the downtime. Enter Squad Blast, which has fixed itself onto me ever since I got my hands on it back in London. It’s got the spirit of Overwatch and CS:GO, but all excitingly represented on a 2D plane. As a result, it really is quite brilliant.
I spent a good chunk of my time at EGX messing around with Squad Blast, and was fortunate enough to interview Anatolijs Ropotovs – CEO and founder of Ultrahorse – about the inspirations for the title, what the studio is hoping to achieve, and why it thinks players will hop over from some of the genre’s big hitters and try out this fresh, more 2D approach.
Squad Blast is a team-based competitive shooter, where you and your partner set out to outsmart and outgun the enemy team within short, punchy objective-based matches. It’s hero-based, which means different characters have different weapons and abilities, and even in my short hour-or-so playing it at the show I could feel the counter-pick meta bubbling behind the scenes. The sniper dominates mid-ranged rocket users, the shotgun beats out the sniper, and the rocket is damn good at cutting off offensive shotgun pushes. You can play defensive, you can play offensive, but you’ve absolutely got to play well... otherwise you’ll see the clear difference between yourself and your opponents. Like in any good competitive title.

                              <span>The Steam Deck has been out in the wild for a while now, and slowly but surely, Valve has ramped up production of the handheld system. The long wait to purchase a Steam Deck has all but diminished, with people now, finally, able to order the system without a reservation.
The reservation system for ordering a Steam Deck required those willing to wait to leave a small deposit, and placed the buyer into a queue of other reservations. The waiting period for reservations to become shipped out orders has been multiple months, however, with the Steam Deck exceeding what Valve estimated for the system, this long period of waiting has steadily been reduced.
As of right now, there simply are no reservations needed or queues when it comes to purchasing a Steam Deck. If you’re looking to buy the handheld for yourself, you can actually jump on Steam right now and order one. There’s no need to leave a deposit, nor do you have to patiently wait for that email to arrive in your inbox, inviting you to finally buy the device.

                              <span>As suggested by leaks, the next Battlefield 2042 in-game event is just over the horizon. The Liquidators is a limited-time event that introduces a new, infantry-only mode to the game.
The Liquidators is a two-week event, kicking off October 11, and ending October 25. During it, players will be able to jump into Tactical Conquest - the new Conquest variant emphasising squad play and tight infantry combat.
There are two versions of Tactical Conquest, and each will be available for a full week. During the first week, the mode will be limited to 8v8, which expands to 16v16 the following week. It&#x27;s best to think of Tactical Conquest as something like Call of Duty&#x27;s Domination, except tickets are counting down instead of the score going up.

                              <span>It feels odd saying &quot;Overwatch 1&quot;, but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game&#x27;s tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I&#x27;d grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I&#x27;d eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch&#x27;s intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2&#x27;s release, it all feels like it&#x27;s come full circle.

                              <span>Archtower is a roguelike and therefore bad, but... hnnnnnnngggh I like it. I might even come to love it, considering it&#x27;s already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a &quot;work in progress&quot; marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It&#x27;s good stuff all round, frankly.

                              <span>A new experience: Weird RPG is the first video game to make my lips numb. My character in the action-RPG is wearing magic tousers, see, which launch explosive basketball hoops every time I make noise into my microphone. Turns out, the most DPS-efficient noise is continually blowing to trill my lips like a child pretending to be a car. Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it&#x27;s too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

                              <span>Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths&#x27; interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the &quot;church mystery&quot; or &quot;sadfutago&#x27;s posts&quot;, among other monikers.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an increasingly ancient beast, gnarled and twisted over the past decade-and-a-bit by many, many mods that sometimes conflict with one another. That’s why Tyler Hallada put together Modmapper, a free tool released earlier this year that shows which of the mods hosted at NexusMods affect which areas of Skyrim. Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I&#x27;ve now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don&#x27;t much like the look of that there laser bot.

Key to this are custom game modes, auto-saves, dynamic difficulty, and inventory streamlining. There’s also a new relaxed mode for the particularly chilled among us. Watch the update trailer below for a rundown, and some trippy space visuals.

                              <span>Electronic Arts have formally launched their new store client doodad after a long open beta, replacing the much-maligned Origin with something they refer to as &quot;the EA app&quot; (its actual name is only &quot;EA&quot;). They say it&#x27;s faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn&#x27;t really matter, as long as it&#x27;s not a disaster, because it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.

                              <span>After years of behind-the-scenes chatter, Nintendo has shared the first trailer for its Chris-Pratt-starring animated Super Mario movie.


Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


Since initial casting details broke last year, all has been largely quiet, but the veil of secrecy has finally been lifted today with the first official teaser trailer, which you can see below.

                              <span>After a year of lengthy, but steadily diminishing, queues to purchase a Steam Deck, Valve has announced its impressive handheld gaming PC is now available without a reservation.


Since last July, Valve has been using a reservation system for Steam Deck orders that first required purchasers to pay a small, deductible sum to join the reservations queue then wait for an invite to make a final purchase. For some time, the wait between the two steps was upward of several months, but the gap has been steadily narrowing as Steam Deck production began to outperform Valve&#x27;s estimates.


Now, some 15 months after reservations for Steam Deck initially opened, Valve has announced the queue has been eradicated. Anyone looking to acquire a Steam Deck can now do so immediately, without needing to wait for an invitation to purchase.

&quot;Since the news of Stadia shutting down,&quot; the company wrote in a statement shared on Twitter, &quot;Bethesda Softworks and ZeniMax Online Studios have been discussing the next steps for our Elder Scrolls Online Stadia players and we appreciate your patience&quot;.


&quot;We are happy to share that our Stadia players will be able to transfer their ESO accounts to PC,&quot; it continued, &quot;bringing with them all of their progress, including but not limited to existing characters, purchased items, achievements, and inventory. Since Stadia players already play ESO on our PC servers, all of their friends and guilds will be waiting for them once they complete the transfer.&quot; Bethesda says it&#x27;ll be sharing details on how to make the transfer soon.

                              <span>Together We Rule, the first major expansion for developer Amplitude Studios&#x27; historical 4X strategy game Humankind, has been given a 9th November release date - and there&#x27;s free play weekend for the base game starting today too.


Together We Rule follows the release of two smaller, culture-focused DLC packs for Humankind - one themed around Africa, the other Latin America - and introduces diplomacy and espionage features intended to &quot;help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently&quot;.


These include the new Congress of Humankind - giving players the means to vote and decide on global doctrines and arbitrate international conflicts - as well as the new Embassy Quarter. The latter can be used to sign mutually beneficial agreements with other empires or force them into taking specific actions through Leverage - a special currency generated by the expansion&#x27;s new Agent units that can be spent to infiltrate, sabotage, and disinform other empires.

                              <span>The eighth expansion for Prison Architect, known as Undead, is on its way to PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4, just in time for Halloween.


Upon its 11th October release, this expansion will bring a whole new element to your gameplay: Survival against some heinous zombies.


&quot;Just in time for spooky season, Undead adds a mix of survival and horror to Prison Architect that will put Wardens&#x27; management skills to the test,&quot; said game director Gaz Wright. &quot;Grappling with the task of survival is no easy feat, as it introduces an extra layer of complexity and pressure to management gameplay.&quot; You can see a little teaser for this expansion below.

                              <span>When EA released Battlefield 2042 almost 11 months ago, the promise of a live service Battlefield game filled brim with a constant stream of content updates was one of the key selling points.


In fact, the live service model was supposed to be used as a substitute for the traditional story campaign, where in-game events would fill in the lore of the new climate-change ridden world.


But all of that was postponed thanks to dire state of the game at launch. Now almost a year since launch and two seasons later, we finally have our first in-season event and new game mode.

Earlier today, The Pokémon Company released a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that included around 14 minutes of gameplay.


But at around the 7.17 mark, just as one trainer enters the town of Artazon, a number of new &#x27;mon can be seen on the minimap at the bottom right of the screen.

A USS Enterprise backpack and Beam Me Up celebration will also be available. 


It sounds like all of the above will be available via the game&#x27;s store, save for Spock - you&#x27;ll get him with Fall Guys&#x27; current season pass, alongside a Borg mask. I have to say, I really love these designs.

Starbreeze, best known for its development of the Payday series, fell from grace following the disastrous launch of Overkill&#x27;s The Walking Dead on Steam back in 2018.


The game&#x27;s failure led to severe financial issues and the exit of the company&#x27;s boss Bo Andersson. Wesley Yin-Poole produced a full-length feature on the company&#x27;s collapse in 2019 which I recommend you give a thorough read if you want the full context.

Doing so will unlock the Resilient Suit and Concussive Blast Gadget in-game, as well as two skill points. Players will also receive news, updates and offers from PlayStation Studios on PC or PlayStation platforms.


Spider-Man Remastered is the first PlayStation game on PC to offer this option, though it looks like Trophy support isn&#x27;t included. It&#x27;s unclear if previous games will also be updated with this feature, or if it will be included in future releases like Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.

A survey on the official Twitter feed has asked fans if they would like to be &quot;able to interact with [their] animal companions?&quot;


There are then three options presented for you to choose from. These are: &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YES&quot; (an important use of all capital letters there for emphasis) or &quot;Yes (in the next update)!&quot;

That&#x27;s from 27th October to 1st November, but there&#x27;s more happening in the horror game all month in its Haunted by Daylight season, including outfits and a new tome.


That tome is called Malevolence and will include memories for Killer Ghost Face and Survivor Mikaela Reid.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the avalance of announcements to come from CD Projekt Red, maker of The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.


Taking a leaf out of Ubisoft&#x27;s recent playbook - when it lay the entirety of its Assassin&#x27;s Creed plans on the table - CD Projekt Red has done similar, discussing projects which we&#x27;ll see release across the whole of the next decade. There&#x27;s going to be a new trilogy of new Witcher games, a Cyberpunk sequel, a new IP and various other spin-offs - though there was no word on Cyberpunk&#x27;s standalone multiplayer portion, and still no firm date for The Witcher 3&#x27;s long-awaited current-gen console update.

With questions still to answer about what we&#x27;d known was coming, how likely is it we&#x27;ll see any of these fresh projects soon? And if not, why announce them now? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan share their thoughts.

                              <span>After months of speculation, leaks and rumours, EA has finally revealed the next installment of the Need for Speed in a swanky new trailer. 


Need for Speed Unbound is lush with an anime aesthetic that&#x27;s combined with the grungy street racing vibes of early Need for Speed games. 


The trailer features American rapper A$AP Rocky, who is heard narrating in the beginning of the trailer before finishing off with what appears to be a brand-new track from the rapper.

                              <span>Brazil has approved Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


In new documentation issued by the country&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE) on Wednesday, the regulator stated it has approved of this deal &quot;without restrictions&quot;.


Along with this approval, CADE did touch on the more high-profile elements of this proposed acquisition, including Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty franchise - a franchise which has recently felt like it&#x27;s been caught up in a custody battle between Xbox and PlayStation.

Spiral Abyss is the only true endgame content for players at high Adventure Ranks. In a recent Gamespot interview, a miHoYo spokesperson was asked if there were plans to release more permanent endgame content in the &quot;same vein&quot;.


&quot;The Spiral Abyss is one of the most effective ways [for] players [to] test out their party composition and combat strength,&quot; miHoYo replied. &quot;If we design another type of permanent endgame that is similar to the Spiral Abyss, it might end up creating excessive anxiety for our players - not everyone is interested in Musk Reef.&quot;

Most significant is the game&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Go feature that allows partner Pokémon to be sent off to battle others alone in the world, or gather items, which should make grinding much smoother.

                              <span>Activision has released its first gameplay trailer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which gives us our first glimpse of the first-person shooter&#x27;s campaign.


The trailer largely confirms the rumours and leaks of the past few months which suggested the campaign would involve the global War on Drugs. 


Task Force 141 is deployed in an unnamed South American country, as it seeks out a terrorist that appears to be allied with drug traffickers. Essentially, the story entangles the War on Terror with the War on Drugs.

EA&#x27;s latest trailer for the game was published today on PlayStation&#x27;s official YouTube channel for Latin America, which has 664,000 subscribers, and wrongly labels the revived survival horror as coming to both PS4 and PS5. 


The listing sparked fan speculation and media reports that the game was also quietly being developed for PS4 and Xbox One.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s surprise announcement that Google would be shutting down Stadia in January, the platform&#x27;s small but dedicated community have petitioned Google to allow the controller to work on other platforms wirelessly. 


The Stadia controller currently works on other devices via a USB cable, but it also has wireless functionality in the form of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that&#x27;s firmware locked. 


While owners wait for a response from Google, some have taken matters into their own hands with some quirky workarounds.

What is the Lost Between Worlds expansion? That&#x27;s a good question - since Ubisoft is yet to announce it. We&#x27;ve asked the publisher for more information today.


Still, details for the Far Cry 6 Game of the Year Edition are now live via listings on the Xbox and PlayStation stores. These note that Lost Between Worlds is &quot;coming soon&quot; - so your £100 purchase will simply grant access whenever it does become available.

These new versions will provide faster loading times, smooth gameplay up to 60fps, and added details in the world when it arrives on 13th January.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has acquired a majority stake in Limbic Entertainment, the developer behind its forthcoming sim game Park Beyond.


The deal marks an increased investment in the German developer, representing the publisher&#x27;s move to create a significant proportion of its business outside of Japan. 


Park Beyond will be Limbic&#x27;s highest profile release so far: a theme park game where players can create bizarre attractions using the &quot;impossification&quot; gimmick. Bandai Namco aims for Limbic&#x27;s sim games to become the new standard.

                              <span>The first thing that hits me about Moonbreaker, the very-different-from-Subnautica game by Unknown Worlds, is how rigid and awkward it feels. It&#x27;s strange because  turn-based combat games are something I&#x27;m really familiar with, but Moonbreaker takes some getting used to though, and some of that I don&#x27;t like, and some of it I really, really do.

It stems from Moonbreaker being a miniatures game. A friend called it Warhammer without the licence and that&#x27;s exactly what it is. You collect and paint the figurines you use in battle; figurines are the whole point, so it&#x27;s not surprising they behave like them and don&#x27;t move around like animated characters. They are frozen in whatever dramatic expression they&#x27;ve been given: cheering, charging, taking aim, whatever. And when they move, it&#x27;s as if someone picked them up and plonked them down somewhere else. And when they attack, it&#x27;s like a child twizzled them in an emulation of the real thing. The figurines are voiced - there&#x27;s a lot of energy and character in the game - but there&#x27;s no escaping you&#x27;re playing an adaptation of a tabletop game. 
But the camera feels rigid too, fixed on rails you&#x27;ll struggle to pull it off. It won&#x27;t let you spin around the battlefield, viewing the action from varying angles, which I&#x27;d really like to do - if only to admire the figurines I&#x27;ve painted. But I also want it for gameplay reasons, so I can see bunched stand-offs more clearly. When large figurines stand near smaller ones it can be hard to see what&#x27;s going on. As it is, I can only nudge the camera&#x27;s rotation slightly before it pings back to a fixed angle, and it doesn&#x27;t help much.

                              <span>Every retro shooter straddles the line between classic and modern design, whether it&#x27;s a new game built in an old engine like Ion Fury and Wrath, or a good old-fashioned murderfest that uses cutting edge tech like Amid Evil. But none walk that line as precisely as Bounding Box Software&#x27;s Prodeus. This is an anachronistic high-wire act, synthesising old and new ideas in a way that is always exciting, occasionally inspired, and defies easy categorisation.


Even the base premise is wilfully elusive, although this is well in the spirit of the genre&#x27;s foundational texts. You&#x27;re an archetypal space marine trapped on a barren but mineral rich asteroid, where a cataclysm has resulted in an all-out war between two interdimensional factions – one representing order, and the other chaos. From your perspective, both sides are equally in your way, and will die by the hundreds, if not thousands, as you carve a path across the surface of the asteroid and beyond.


Prodeus&#x27; amalgamated personality is evident in its visual style, which mimics the 2.5D graphics of early id-tech and Build engine games then infuses it with modern lighting and visual effects. Terrain and environments are rendered in angular 3D, while objects and enemies are presented as chunky sprites (although there&#x27;s an option to swap them for 3D models too). When you fire a rocket or shoot an explosive barrel, the resulting blast will illuminate the scene in a fiery orange glow, while environmental light sources glisten off gunmetal corridors and rain-slicked terrain.

                              <span>After a rocky launch, Blizzard has updated fans on its progress tackling some of the various issues which have plagued Overwatch 2 over the past 24 hours. 


Many fans have been left unable to play for long periods, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.


These issues have been exacerbated by a series of DDOS attacks aimed at the game&#x27;s servers. And today, following a bruising 24 hours, Blizzard has apologised.

                              <span>Blizzard has pulled back from its requirement that players add their mobile phone number to their Battle.net account in order to play Overwatch 2. 


It was previously mandatory for players to enroll in the &quot;SMS Protect&quot; system to access the game. Players who declined would be unable to login to the game&#x27;s servers. 


Blizzard argued that SMS Protect was necessary as the game transitioned to a live service free-to-play model, in order to combat &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot; and stop banned users simply creating a new account.

There&#x27;s been code in the works for years but across desktops and drivers, it&#x27;s still a long-term effort getting HDR support on the Linux desktop. Even going back to 2016, with NVIDIA&#x27;s cross-platform driver code the Linux desktop remained the bottleneck.

The AMD Cloud Platform is a currently parallel effort to the Accelerator Cloud with the former intended more for developers while the latter is more customer-oriented. After trying out the AMD Cloud Platform, it&#x27;s indeed an easy way to evaluate the latest AMD data center wares while having a easy-to-deploy, pre-configured software environment.</span>

                              <span>Up until now, buying a Steam Deck meant first purchasing a reservation, then waiting weeks or months until you came to the front of the queue before you could complete your purchase. No longer. Valve say that they&#x27;ve increased their manufacturing capacity such that you can now buy a Steam Deck without a reservation.

They&#x27;ve also made the Steam Deck&#x27;s dock available to purchase. It costs $80/£80 and has the same 1-2 week delivery estimate as the Deck itself.

Luiga, who worked on the game in its early days, made the comment in a new interview in which he also says that he believes &quot;fans had a right to know&quot; about the developers&#x27; departure from the studio.

More interestingly, it also includes a new expansion that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet.

                              <span>When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom&#x27;s Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque&#x27;s challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I&#x27;m sorry to say that&#x27;s about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

Pre-orderers can play the campaign a week early, technically, but that’s still a good couple of weeks away as well. By the way, could you help me out? I can’t remember the actor who’s playing the shouty general’s name and it’s really bothering me. He’s in the trailer below, watch it and let me know in the comments please.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s be clear about one thing: whatever else I say today doesn&#x27;t deny that building games are in a great state right now. Within just the last few years, we&#x27;ve not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers &amp; Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they&#x27;ve had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

                              <span>The next Need For Speed has been revealed at last, and its new graphical direction is what I can only describe as pulling an &#x27;Into The Spiderverse&#x27;. Yep, Need For Speed Unbound is looking pretty cel-shaded, with little cartoon streams of dust flying up from the wheels of your speeding vehicle. Substantially pimped-out vehicle, might I add, courtesy of rapper and general lad A$AP Rocky. Take a look at his motor in the trailer below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 isn&#x27;t even out yet and there&#x27;s already a rumour circulating that, to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, the game&#x27;s going to receive a paid &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; map pack featuring a bunch of the classic maps from across the series. We&#x27;re talking favourites from Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch, all rolled into one mega-bundle.
Of course, it&#x27;s only a rumour, which means it could be debunked at any moment. But it did get Hayden and I – the resident codders of the RPS Treehouse – thinking. If this rumour turns out to be true, which maps would we like to see return for Modern Warfare 2?

Y’see, Biotech introduces pregnancy, child-rearing, and families. It isn’t stopping there, because there’s also genetic engineering now. Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

The two week drought is broken with a shower of Electronic Wireless Show podcast rain, were we discuss the best villainous breakdowns we&#x27;ve enjoyed in video games. Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew&#x27;s is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That&#x27;s one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

                              <span>Last month, I enjoyed playing Card Cowboy, a wee wild west adventure which uses cards to tell silly stories. As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

                              <span>The Sims 4 always gets a few fun bugs to investigate in and around new content coming out (which is all the time), and The Sims 4 Werewolves is no exception. The laundry list of issues that the team are investigating this month has a raft of fun werewolf-centric bugs like humans being able to sniff each other, and a wolf getting mad that he&#x27;s the bottom (of the pack) even though he&#x27;s the alpha. The High School Years update from July is also facilitating accidental sibling incest, still, after one method of sibling highschool be-sandwiching was fixed in August. It appears to be an entrenched problem. Those kids must really like House Of The Dragon.

Headed up by Starward Industries, which is a super-group of devs who can list such esteemed projects as The Witcher 3, Dying Light, and Call of Juarez on their collective CV, The Invincible is an adventure game based on an acclaimed genre work by a celebrated Polish author which I haven’t read and neither have you.


That’s where its similarities with The Witcher games start and end. The Invincible is a landmark work of hard science fiction which explores the perils of space colonisation and the very nature of alien life: the forms it may take, whether we’d recognise it, and how our prejudices might affect our decision making when encountering it. The game of the same name is not a beat-for-beat adaptation of the book, but a re-telling centred around a new character named Yasna: a female protagonist who doesn’t exist in the novel, but has been created fresh for the game as a concession to the fact that it is no longer the mid-sixties.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is out, and is having a range of serious problems in its early days. This includes a massive DDOS attack that has led to server queues up in the 40,000s, as well as a a mandatory phone verification system for players (although this has now been removed for Overwatch 1 players). However, that doesn’t mean that original Overwatch players are out of the mud quite yet, as some are finding their hero roster locked away.
This bug is likely a result of the intended new-player experience for those who weren’t Overwatch 1 players, as this group will need to grind through over 100 matches in order to unlock all of the original roster.The bad news is that it seems like the game is applying this restriction to players who are anything but new, forcing them to reboot the game as the only current fix which throws them back into the queue.
This includes Reddit user GumpaGumpa, who posted their issue onto the Overwatch 2 Reddit yesterday showing their largely locked roster. Below the original post, numerous other players express their frustration with the bug, and some even claiming a single restart didn’t help at all, leaving them still without their full arsenal of characters several hours later.

                              <span>EA has released the reveal trailer for Need for Speed Unbound a bit earlier than originally planned today.
This is likely due to the game leaking yesterday thanks to a Japanese retail listing.
While there isn&#x27;t any information on the game available at present, as the official website still has a countdown clock going, the video does a good job showing off a new look for the series.

                              <span>“Heroes never die.” That’s Overwatch’s little mantra – a motto you’ve probably heard a million times over if you or one of your teammates has ever been a Mercy main. It sort-of became a de facto rallying cry for the game, too: no matter how many times Blizzard slowed down the drip feed of new content, it always came back. Often with a bang. Like a true hero, Overwatch – or the original Overwatch at least – could never stay down. 

That was until its own creator came along to put a bullet in its head. In order for a new hero to rise, the original one had to die. So Blizzard stood above its favourite creation, placed the cold steel to its forehead, and pulled the trigger without a second thought. In theory, what rose from the ashes would be harder, better, faster, stronger… but in reality, it’s been a pale imitation of what came before.
Overwatch 2, let’s face it, has had an appalling launch. If you’ve spent even a fraction of a second online this past week, you’ll have seen stories about the queues. Blizzard notes that a lot of the issue with logging in comes down to DDoS attacks on its servers. Fast-forward 48 hours, though, and little has changed; I have the Xbox version of the game open as I write this, and I have gone from 400 people ahead of me in the queue, to 300, to 800, and now to 1600.

                              <span>A new Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer has been released, and it goes over some of the things you will be up to in the game.
It goes over all sorts of things, ranging from customization to raids, picnics, and tera-type formations.
The video discusses how as a student you will participate in an independent study program called Treasure Hunt. It goes on to show four upcoming trainers&#x27; journeys as they search for a &quot;treasure&quot; of their own. Which we assume are Pokemon.

                              <span>Infinity Ward and Activision debuted the Modern Warfare 2 gameplay launch trailer moments ago. This was a livestream-style reveal, with the trailer having just aired on Call of Duty&#x27;s YouTube channel. 
We&#x27;re still several weeks away from the launch of the game, of course, so while a dropping a launch trailer now might seem strange, it&#x27;s a thing more and more publishers have been doing in recent years, mainly to ramp up pre-orders.
Love the tactic or hate it, though, this new Modern Warfare 2 trailer is good. The focus is squarely on the single-player campaign here. We get treated to plenty of new footage, showing both gameplay and cutscenes from various missions.

                              <span>In a bid to keep player accounts protected and curb in-game toxicity, Blizzard added an SMS Protect system to Overwatch 2 for players. This system required all players, across all platforms, to have a phone number associated with their Battle.net accounts.
Except, this isn’t just about protecting players; the SMS Protect system also aids Blizzard with controlling exactly who can access Overwatch 2. Blizzard has since announced it will be removing the SMS protect system for Overwatch 2 players that previously played Overwatch 1 since June, 9, 2021. If you’re not exactly sure what the deal with SMS Protect is, we’ve explained it here.
In a previous blog post detailing its Defense Matrix initiative, which is aimed at disincentivising disruptive behaviour and gameplay, Blizzard said, “SMS Protect brings meaningful change when it comes to disruptive play. This additional layer of security is an industry-proven solution in combating both cheating and disruptive behaviour, further protecting your Overwatch 2 experience from bad actors.”

                              <span>Fast laptops are expensive, cheap laptops are slow. But even a fast laptop is slower than a decent workstation, and if your developers want a local build environment they&#x27;re probably going to want a decent workstation. They&#x27;ll want a fast (and expensive) laptop as well, though, because they&#x27;re not going to carry their workstation home with them and obviously you expect them to be able to work from home. And in two or three years they&#x27;ll probably want a new laptop and a new workstation, and that&#x27;s even more money. Not to mention the risks associated with them doing development work on their laptop and then drunkenly leaving it in a bar or having it stolen or the contents being copied off it while they&#x27;re passing through immigration at an airport. Surely there&#x27;s a better way?

                              <span>I work on OpenJDK backports:
taking a patch that was committed to a current version of JDK, and adapting it
to an older one. There are four main OpenJDK versions that I am concerned with:
the current version (&quot;jdk&quot;), 8, 11 and 17. These are all maintained in separate
Git(Hub) repositories.
It&#x27;s very useful to have access to the other JDKs when working on any
particular version. For example, to backport a patch from the latest version to
17, where the delta is not too big, a lot of the time you can cherry-pick the
patch unmodified. To do git cherry-pick  in a git repository
tracking JDK17, where  is in &quot;jdk&quot;, I need the &quot;jdk&quot; repository
configured as a remote for my local jdk17 repository.
Maintaining completely separate local git repositories for all four JDK vers…</span>

                              <span>Almost to the week one year since the last maintenance release, we can announce another maintenance release, now at version 0.0.17, of the RVowpalWabbit package. The CRAN maintainers kindly and politly pointed out that I was (cough, cough) apparently the last maintainer who had packages that set StagedInstall: no. Guilty as charged.
RVowpalWabbit is one the two packages; the other one will hopefully follow ‘shortly’. And while I long suspected linking aspects to drive this (this is an old package, newer R packaging of the awesome VowpalWabbit is in rvw, I was plain wrong here. The cause was an absolute path to an included dataset, computed in an example, which then gets serialized. As Tomas Kalibera suggested, we can replace the constant with a function and all is well. So here is 0.0.17.
As noted before, there is a newer package rvw based on the excellent GSoC 2018 and beyond work by Ivan Pavlov (mentored by James and myself) so if you are into VowpalWabbit from R go check it out.
CRANberries provides a summary of changes to the previous version. More information is on the RVowpalWabbit page. Issues and bugreports should go to the GitHub issue tracker.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

                              <span>Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG&#x27;s Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG&#x27;s 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell&#x27;s even better S2721DGFA - and it&#x27;s this monitor that&#x27;s on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that&#x27;s already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it&#x27;s not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that&#x27;s equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I&#x27;ll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow for more deals.

                              <span>The Crucial X6 is one of the best portable SSDs on the market, and a ginormous 2TB model is currently discounted to £129 at Amazon, from its normal price of £150. This makes it the cheapest 2TB portable SSD by a significant margin, with alternatives like the Samsung T7 and SanDisk Extreme 2TB costing £191 or more - and an excellent value for a drive of this calibre.

Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

                              <span>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) have set a statutory deadline of March 1st for their investigation into Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and any third parties submitting responses to the CMA have until February to do so. As detailed in an update to the CMA’s administrative timetable for their investigation, it might be the case that provisional findings are brought forward in January, a year after the deal was first revealed.

I would&#x27;ve been happy for that one to go either way, so I&#x27;m glad that the outcome was closer than I expected. This week, it&#x27;s a question of whether you leave a place with a song on your lips or your pockets bulging. What&#x27;s better: an end credits song, or utterly rinsing a place?

                              <span>Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn&#x27;t a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that&#x27;s your jam.
Whether you&#x27;re new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don&#x27;t know whether it goes beyond &quot;perfectly enjoyable&quot; into &quot;thrilling&quot;, though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it&#x27;s a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

                              <span>Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man&#x27;s Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it&#x27;s a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn&#x27;t have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn&#x27;t have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn&#x27;t have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn&#x27;t be has never left me, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn&#x27;t able to get back up to it again.

                              <span>Last month, Rachel and I made the long pilgrammage to Seattle in order to attend PAX West 2022. While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we&#x27;d discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we&#x27;re now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there&#x27;s something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights. Scroll down to see what we got up to, and remember, if you like what you see please do consider funding content like this via our supporters programme. It truly means an awful lot.

All this comes via a listing, still live at the time of writing, on Japanese retailer Neowing&#x27;s website - which, assuming its veracity (highly likely given the nature of the assets and details included), corroborates virtually all previous rumours circulating around the game in recent months.


First is the name, Need for Speed: Unbound, which tallies with a report from Insider Gaming at the end of September, as does Neowing&#x27;s listed release date of 2nd December this year.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr, the well-received 2018 action-RPG from developer NeocoreGames, will be making its way to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on 27th October.


Inquisitor - Martyr is a Diablo-esque take on the Warhammer 40,000 universe, casting players as Inquisitors who must battle their way, either solo or with friends, through a &quot;haunted fortress-monastery which hides a terrible secret from the past&quot;.


It features cover-based combat, four classes (Psyker, Crusader, Assassin, and Tech-Adept, with the new Sororitas class due at a later date), a procedurally generated mission system, skill trees, a wide range of weapons and vehicles, two-player local co-op on consoles - as well as four-player online multiplayer - and more.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has expanded once more, this time introducing a free Boss Rush mode - and an assortment of related rewards for those with sufficient skills - for players on PC.


Boss Rush mode is accessed through a basement door in the Prisoner&#x27;s Quarters and features four different stages to battle through. All four stages feature back-to-back bosses to defeat, one containing three bosses, another featuring five bosses, plus two more containing three and five enhanced bosses respectively. These enhanced bosses feature &quot;more ways to kick your ass&quot;, including new limbs, healing powers, and even some friends to help them.


Each of the four challenges feature bosses randomly selected from three tiers (although players must have encountered them in Normal mode before they appear), with three-boss challenges starting with a boss from Tier 1, then moving on to Tier 2, then Tier 3. Five-boss challenges feature two Tier 1 bosses, two Tier 2 bosses, then a final boss from Tier 3.

                              <span>Nintendo has quietly tightened up its policies regarding the release of adult games on Switch, a publisher has said.


In a recent Twitter thread (thanks, Nintendo Everything), adult game publisher Gamuzumi told fans it had heard back from Nintendo after facing an unexpected delay in the launch of its most recent title, Hot Tentacles Shooter.


According to Gamuzumi, which describes itself as a &quot;boutique publisher focused on releasing mature or &#x27;ecchi&#x27; [softcore hentai] titles&quot;, Nintendo has now ruled that games featuring topless anime women are no longer allowed.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between EA Originals and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series), transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan where up to three players can battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.


Omega Force - which has previous experience in the monster hunting genre, courtesy of its two Toukiden games - has now expanded on Wild Hearts&#x27; initial reveal with seven minutes of new, largely uninterrupted gameplay footage.

                              <span>In Gotham Knights, Batman is dead. &quot;Like, dead-dead,&quot; as WB Montreal put it during our preview, and in his place comes four sub-heroes: Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing and Red Hood. These are, barring any surprises, who you will play as in Gotham Knights. I played as three of them in the preview - Batgirl and Red Hood in early game scenarios, and Robin for a late-game mission and boss fight - and I can now say with confidence that they are… fine.


It&#x27;s faint praise, and I&#x27;m loath to be too harsh on Gotham Knights when we&#x27;re still a few weeks away from launch. But at the moment it&#x27;s underwhelming, and underwhelming in terms of real substance, rather than technical performance - it looks nice enough and ran without any hiccups while we played over streaming platform Parsec. 


What&#x27;s missing is a sense of conviction. The setup sees you making a base of the Belfrey, a clock tower hideout that&#x27;ll be familiar to series fans, where you can mooch about and briefly chat with the other characters, swap between them, and launch missions or an exploration of the open world of Gotham City. Gotham looks quite good, but also a little muted next to the Gotham of Rocksteady&#x27;s Arkham games - especially Arkham Knight - where that glorious, gothic maximalism is replaced with more of a mediumalism. The city&#x27;s deep blacks seem more like faded browns, the rain doesn&#x27;t fall as hard, there&#x27;s no sense of sharpness, rankness, no distinctive air of criminal filth and grime, and with a kind of unnerving clarity to it all, like an old game that&#x27;s been visually &quot;remastered&quot; by an AI, its atmosphere lost without its textured fog.

                              <span>The CD Projekt Red team helming development on the next Cyberpunk game will relocate to Boston in the US to start a new internal studio.


Yesterday, the Polish developer released a detailed timeline documenting all its upcoming games for the foreseeable future. This included the next game in the Cyberpunk series, which is codenamed &quot;Orion&quot;, along with updates on its Witcher series and a new IP known for now as &quot;Hadar&quot;.


Following this announcement, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s global PR director Radek Grabowski shared that the company would  establish a new studio, known as CD Projekt Red North America, to lead its next Cyberpunk-based project.

Sign-ups are now live via the PlayStation App and PlayStation.com, Sony has said, though new members will accepted on a &quot;rolling basis&quot; and some should expect to be &quot;randomly put on the waitlist&quot;. 


If you are put on the waitlist, you will be able to gain access &quot;in about two months&quot; from your registration date.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s first enthusiast-grade graphics cards are here - and on the eve of AMD and Nvidia&#x27;s transition to a new generation, Team Blue has actually done well. The $289 Arc A750 and $329/$349 Arc A770 offer surprisingly strong 1080p performance, a unique mix of features and aggressive pricing that makes them well worth considering for a mid-range PC - for most gamers, anyway.  
Let&#x27;s not get ahead of ourselves, though. There&#x27;s loads to cover here and time is short, so let&#x27;s take a quick overview of the hardware, cover the software features we&#x27;re most interested in and then get into the meat of this review: gaming benchmarks. 
We&#x27;ve got a brand new GPU test suite for late 2022, with a tranche of complete newcomers joining a remixed assortment of Digital Foundry favourites covering every major engine. It&#x27;s a forward-looking test suite, with titles using modern APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan, which should give Intel a chance to demonstrate its strengths. Of course, we&#x27;ll also be taking a look at performance in some classic &#x27;banana skin&#x27; DX11 titles in our video review, where we expect Intel&#x27;s first-generation Arc GPUs to have slightly more difficulty.

The role has instead gone to Jennifer Hale, who has voiced characters such as Commander Shephard in Mass Effect and Naomi Hunter in the Metal Gear Solid series, to name but a few.


In an interview with Game Informer, which features Bayonetta 3 as its cover this issue, director Yusuke Miyata explained that &quot;overlapping circumstances&quot; meant that Taylor was unable to reprise her role as Bayonetta. As such, Hale stepped in to take the place of the series&#x27; title role, with Miyata stating he felt she was a &quot;good match for the character&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

                              <span>Fortnite seemingly has everything these days. The Rock. Indiana Jones. Ripley from Alien. Now, it has the car from Rocket League. 


At least this collaboration makes some sense - both Rocket League maker Psyonix and Fortnite are products of Epic Games, which has already worked in the past to bring its two audiences together.


Now, you can drive Rocket League&#x27;s most famous vehicle - the Octane - within Fortnite. As you&#x27;d expect, it behaves just as it would on a Rocket League pitch - able to boost to high speeds and rapidly climb up walls.

On Steam, its £50 price sits in line with other upcoming AAA launches, such as Gotham Knights, Sonic Frontiers, The Callisto Protocol, Hogwarts Legacy and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns.

On console, the price point for these games varies a little more. Sonic Frontiers is £50, Callisto Protocol is £55 and Hogwarts Legacy is £60, while Gotham Knights and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns are £65.

With this app in play, users will now be able to see all of the channel&#x27;s offerings in Ultra HD thanks to its 4K HDR playback support (the PlayStation 4 version of the app was limited to 1080p).


&quot;A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we&#x27;re excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users,&quot; said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of product and design for Disney streaming (thanks, The Verge). &quot;The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans.&quot;

New documentation from the CMA states that its statutory deadline to publish the final report will be 1st March, 2023. As such, the final deadline for all parties&#x27; responses regarding this investigation will be in February.


Between that time and now, the CMA will be conducting meetings with the main and third parties involved with this acquisition, issuing questionnaires and verifying the information provided.

                              <span>The European Union has voted to adopt a single charger design for use across all portable games consoles, smartphones, tablets and laptops sold in the region. 


Technology manufacturers will now be required to use USB-C charging ports in all smartphones and tablets sold in the region from 2024, and in laptops from 2026. Mice, keyboards, headphones are also included.


As previously reported, the UK decided to opt out out of being included in this initiative when it was first proposed, despite its aims to cut electronic waste and generally make things a bit easier for those with a drawer full of random Lightning cables,  micro-USB and mini-USB wires. Thanks Brexit!

                              <span>A few weeks back a friend recommended Jonathan Crary&#x27;s 24/7, a short, vital book I have just finished reading. I suspect a lot of it went over my head, but the basics are pretty simple. Crary, who is a professor of modern art and theory at Columbia, makes the case that the contemporary world&#x27;s focus on an endless 24/7 treadmill of consumption and toil has made sleep the true enemy of capitalism. Sleep is the last place where you cannot be sold stuff, or made to work, and so capitalism must fight sleep, and it will probably be a fight to the death.


Crary takes this argument in a number of fascinating, alarming ways. What he doesn&#x27;t mention - and I understand this, I guess - is a great-uncle of mine who used to own a turkey farm, and had heard that turkeys were so stupid that when the lights went off they thought the day was over. He rigged up a system in his turkey farm, a farm which clearly should have been shut down by the authorities, in which the lights continually went on and off, the theory being that the turkeys would age by a day each time this happened, and would be ready for market sooner. I don&#x27;t need to add anything at this point, but I will: my great uncle was not a very nice man and should not be interpreted as the hero of this story.


Both of these things - Crary&#x27;s illuminating book and the involuntary memory about a family member that it prompted - created what is basically the single least ideal mindset in which to experience Slime Rancher 2, which is out in early access at the moment and is taking over the world. Slime Rancher 2 is a thing of joy: exploration and curiosity delivered in thick, buttery pastels. But it is also the kind of horror that Crary would potentially identify as pure capitalist indoctrination - a game that people are exposed to rather than asked to play. I don&#x27;t think that would be entirely fair, but everything about this game is contradictory and challenging.

Players have reported unexpected server errors and difficulties joining Overwatch 2 games throughout the evening following today&#x27;s free-to-play launch, with some claiming to be experiencing queues of as many as 40,000 other players.


An earlier tweet by Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra acknowledged today&#x27;s server woes but gave no indication they might be the result of anything other that launch day teething troubles, only thanking players for their patience and pledging to &quot;get [them] into the fun&quot;.

                              <span>IO Interactive has announced it has once again delayed the release of Freelance mode for Hitman 3.
Originally slated for spring before being moved to the second half of this year, IO states that while the mode is &quot;almost ready,&quot; there are a few more things to be certain of before Freelancer launches.
To that end, the studio plans to host a Freelancer closed technical test for the rogue-like mode. In early November, the IO will selectively invite Hitman 3 players on Steam to put the mode through its paces.

The leak comes from Japanese retailer Neowing (thanks, reddit), which has the game listed for a December 2 release on PS5. Other platforms, such as PC and Xbox Series X/S, were not noted, but it&#x27;s presently assumed the game may be a new-gen-only release.
Alongside information on the game, four screenshots are posted, showing off a new cel-shaded art style for the series&#x27; characters.

                              <span>^ Stick around after the ads for some pristine 1440p footage and a discussion about Modern Warfare 2’s place in the modern era of shooters.


As infuriating exercises in being the severalth thing in a series but having the same title as the original go, the Modern Warfare reboot wasn’t half bad. We spent a bunch of time in the multiplayer beta for MW2 ahead of the full release at the end of this month, and found a solid (if a little muddled) Call of Duty game in there.


But we have to wonder: in a world far removed from the original Modern Warfare 2, which solidified CoD’s utter dominance of the 360 era back in 2009, what place does 2022’s MW2 multiplayer have in a crowded marketplace full of free-to-play competition? Not just from the Fortnites and APEX’s of this world, but from its own Battle Royale spin-off, Warzone, which is itself getting a sequel in Warfare 2.0, dropping next month as part of MW2’s first season.

Bayonetta 3 was revealed in September 2021, and at the time, Bayonetta&#x27;s prior voice actor, Hellena Taylor, was unable to confirm whether or not she would once again lend her voice to the Umbra Witch.

Published by EA, the game takes place in a fantasy version of feudal Japan called Azuma, a region full of scenic meadows and rich bamboo forests. The area is being ravaged by formerly peaceful, nature-infused beasts called Kemono, which are now altering their environment at the cost of citizens’ lives.
Kemono can range from from plant-infused squirrels to the massive Kingtusk wild boar.

                              <span>PUBG is getting a harrowing new event this October (as is New State) thanks to a spooky new Dead by Daylight crossover event on the horizon. As part of this new promotion, players of all three games will be able to net themselves some fancy new cosmetics, as well as take part in some exclusive events. Is this better than going outside and throwing chocolate at children? We’ll let you decide.
Lets start with PUBG players. As part of the event, battle royale heads will be able to earn 4 costumes and masks, 3 new backpack skins, a pan skin and a themed name plate between October 19 - December 7. These are all based on Dead by Daylight, so you’ll be able to rep a selection of your favourite killers as you drop into the firefight below.
In addition, there’s an exclusive Dead by Daylight hide and seek in-game web event that players can jump into in order to unlock some additional goodies. Four players can access it through the in-game lobby banner, where three survivors have to escape a killer in typical Dead by Daylight fashion: throwing objects and repairing generators in order to make their escape.

                              <span>Call of Duty is continuning to run out of ideas, as it appears we&#x27;re getting a new Advanced Warfare game from Sledgehammer Games. The studio, which created Advanced Warfare, went on to develop WW2, and the poorly-received Vanguard.
Assuming the Call of Duty development cycle goes according to plan, Advanced Warfare 2 will follow up Treyarch&#x27;s game, which is the next game in the franchise after this year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2.
The news comes from a Ralph Valve report, who&#x27;s a leaker with a proven track record when it comes to Call of Duty scoops. According to their report, the new Advanced Warfare will be built on the updated IW 9.0 engine - the same one that powers Modern Warfare 2, and Treyarch&#x27;s unannounced game.

                              <span>Certain clever computer wizards have managed to jailbreak the PS5, albeit in a limited capacity where you’re only able to install software, but not launch it. Nonetheless, this limited jailbreak has allowed some out there to jump in and install the long dead but dearly missed PT onto their PS5 consoles. It’s just a shame they can’t actually boot it up and play it.
This jailbreak was released to the public by Twitter user Specter via a Github link. This jailbreak only works on PS5 consoles running the 4.03 firmware or lower, which would on be present on any PS5 that hasn&#x27;t been updated past October 2021. As such, chances are the PS5 sitting next to you (if you’re lucky enough to have one) can&#x27;t be jailbroken using this method.
However, if you are able to get the jailbreak working, you’re able to get into the PS5 debug menu and download various PS4 files on your system. This includes the mysterious PT, as shown by Twitter user Lance Mcdonald (see below), which was removed from sale years ago as a result of a fallout between Hideo Kojima and Konami, which resulted in the cancellation of the highly-anticipated Silent Hills.

                              <span>Ahead of Nintendo’s presentation on Thursday, a poster for The Super Mario Bros. Movie has been released, and it’s jam-packed with the sort of easter eggs and curious details that the average punter might miss. And let’s face it, who has time to zoom into a Twitter post? Well, luckily for you, it’s our job to do that sort of thing so you don’t have to. So, here’s 7 things we found in the Mario poster that may give us some clues as to the upcoming film’s story:

The Antique Shop’s Pixelated Goods

Could this be a clue as to the Mario movie’s canonicity within the wider continuity of the games? I can’t believe I just typed that sentence with a straight face. But hear me out: on those shelves you can clearly see switch blocks and music boxes from Super Mario Bros 3. Is this an indication that the film considers the classic games to have happened in its timeline?

                              <span>Overwatch 2 became available less than 24 hours ago, and as expected, there have been some teething issues when it comes to accessing the game. This isn’t something we aren’t used to by any means, but experiencing queues of up to 40,000 players at once still saw me go to bed early rather than stick around to try and play.
That said, Blizzard has acknowledged the queue times for the free-to-play multiplayer title via Twitter. Mike Ybarra, president of Blizzard, tweeted that the team was working hard to fix the server issues, and that Blizzard was humbled to see the excitement of its players.
Later, however, Mike Ybarra followed up on his prior tweet by quoting it with, “Unfortunately, we are experiencing a mass DDoS attack on our servers. Teams are working hard to mitigate/manage. This is causing a lot of drop/connection issues.”

That includes a new trilogy of The Witcher RPGs, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and a brand new IP being developed by CD Projekt Red, plus two further games in The Witcher universe being created by third-party studios.

                              <span>Put a screenshot of Overwatch 2 next to a screenshot of Overwatch 1, and you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to spot any difference. Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I&#x27;ve experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King&#x27;s Row and Route 66, it&#x27;s like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I&#x27;ve simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I&#x27;m not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

Dusk Golem&#x27;s comments were posted in a thread on ResetEra where members of the forum were discussing a recent report that Death Stranding 2 would be released on Stadia, which Dusk Golem debunked.

                              <span>Sony plans to continue supporting PC with its first-party games, but it could take &quot;at least a year&quot; for the games to release for the platform.
That&#x27;s according to PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst who added that the firm&#x27;s live-service games may be released earlier than one year post launch.
Various first-party titles have already been released on PC, and these include Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered. In the PC pipeline is Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Uncharted: The Legacy Collection.

This will be our first look at the film featuring the famous plumber who &quot;travels through an underground labyrinth with his brother to save a captured princess.&quot;
The Super Mario Bros. movie was first announced back in 2018, but it wasn&#x27;t until last year that we had official casting confirmation. Chris Pratt (Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy) will lend his voice to Mario with Charlie Day (Always Sunny in Philadelphia) voicing Luigi.

                              <span>We are roughly a month away from God of War: Ragnarok, and that means every PlayStation gamer and their grandma is either replaying the God of War saga – or they&#x27;re planning to. And that might (and should) include the PSP games. Because they objectively kick ass.

But here’s the problem: Sony refuses to make it easy for us to play those titles despite having launched an upgraded version of its PS Plus subscription service earlier this year. “It’ll be packed with classics,” the platform holder said.

God of War diehards will surely have no problems as they’ve been hoarding all and each of Kratos’ adventures over the years, but newcomers or casual fans probably never gave Chains of Olympus or Ghost of Sparta a fair chance.

While remaining true to the original game’s vision, Motive has completely rebuilt the game from the ground up in the Frostbite game engine. This time out, players will find there&#x27;s more to learn aboard the USG Ishimura as they relive the story with newly added narrative elements.
Along with the new narrative elements, Dead Space will also include gameplay improvements including such as the Peeling System. With it, Necromorphs have been reconstructed and will feature layered flesh, tendons and bones that break, tear and shatter.

                              <span>In an unexpected announcement, Bloober Team has revealed via a blog post that it will be working in cooperation with Platige Image to prepare, develop, and co-produce a television adaptation of horror game, The Medium.
More specifically, work will be carried out with the creative supervision of Tomasz Bagiński and Piotr Babieno. Babieno is the creator of The Medium and writer of the Blair Witch game, with Bagiński being a self-taught artist who isn’t a stranger to games, having worked on the introductions to The Witcher 2 and 3, and the teaser trailer for Cyberpunk 2077.
On the partnership and revelation of the TV adaptation, Piotr Babieno shares that, “Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together. My joy is even greater because two Polish companies are taking part in production, and a series will be created on the basis of our game.”

Considering this delay comes a little over a month away from the game&#x27;s original release date, and follows a few rounds of public demos, media previews and closed tests - Relic has explained why the decision was made.
According to the developer, the extra time will be spent on polishing the overall experience, fine-tuning balance, improving performance and implementing key gameplay changes based on feedback collected from insiders.

We only know about the release target because EA told investors that there&#x27;s a new Need for Speed coming out this calendar year.
The first shot in what&#x27;s sure to be a short hype campaign for the next Need for Speed, came in the form of a nondescript tweet from the official EA account to... the official Need for Speed account. &quot;You think they&#x27;re ready, @needforspeed?&quot; it reads.

Hello Games has, seemingly, worked tirelessly to build No Man’s Sky from the ground up and turn it into what is, perhaps, one of the best space exploration and survival games out there. The game, ever since its initial release in 2016, continues to be privy to updates and improvements that’ll benefit long-time fans and newcomers.
The 4.0 update is intended to coincide with the debut of No Man’s Sky on Nintendo Switch, planned for October 7, but what does the update actually include? Well, via an interview with PC Gamer, Hello Games’ Sean Murray tells all.

The trailer will be livestreamed, which we&#x27;ve come to expect in recent years for big reveals. You&#x27;ll be able to follow along on YouTube (player embedded below), at 8am PT, 11am ET, 4pm BST.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve begun writing up my phd and, not for the first time, I&#x27;m pondering
issues of how best to represent things. Specifically, rewrite rules.
Here&#x27;s one way of representing an example rewrite rule:
streamFilter g . streamFilter f &#x3D; streamFilter (g . f)

This is a fairly succinct representation. It&#x27;s sort-of Haskell, but not
quite. It&#x27;s an equation. The left-hand side is a pattern: it&#x27;s intended
to describe not one expression but a family of expressions that match.
The lower case individual letters g and f are free variables:
labelled placeholders within the pattern that can be referred to on the
right hand side. I haven&#x27;t stipulated what defines a free variable and
what is a more concrete part of the pattern. It&#x27;s kind-of Haskell, and
I&#x27;ve used the well-known operator . to represent the two…</span>

                              <span>mrcal 2.2 (the release notes are available here). This release
contains lots of medium-important internal improvements, and is a result of



Heavy dogfooding. I use these tools a lot every day, and many things are
nicer, easier and work better in 2.2 than in 2.1

Not-yet-completed cool new functionality. Some of the required internal
improvements for the big new features are being released here.




The biggest single new feature in this release is the interactive graphical tool
for examining dense stereo results: accessed via mrcal-stereo --viz stereo.



The next pressing thing is improved documentation. The tour of mrcal is still a
good overview of some of the functionality that makes mrcal unique and far
better than traditional calibration tools. But it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of
demonstrating how you would actually use mrcal to diagnose and handle common
calibration issues. I need to gather some releasable representative data, and
write docs around that.



Then I&#x27;m going to start finishing the big new features in the roadmap (these are
all already functional, but need polish):



Triangulation functions in the optimization loop for efficient
structure-from-motion

Support for non-central projection to remove a significant source of bias
present in very wide lenses

Improved projection uncertainty quantification to resolve accuracy and
performance issues in the current projection uncertainty method</span>

The Dragon Never Sleeps as typical of
1980s science fiction: Cook is far better known for his Black
Company military fantasy series, this is one of his minor novels, and
it&#x27;s only been intermittently in print.  But I&#x27;m dubious this would have
been published at all today.



First, the writing is awful.  It&#x27;s choppy, cliched, awkward, and has no
rhythm or sense of beauty.  Here&#x27;s a nearly random paragraph near the
beginning of the book as a sample:



XII Fulminata!  What the
    hell?  Was some malign force ranged against him?



    That was his most secret fear.  That somehow someone or something was
    using him the way he used so many others.


    &quot;What mischief have you been up to, Kez Maefele?&quot;



    &quot;Staying alive in a hostile universe.&quot;



    &quot;You&#x27;ve had more than your share of luck.&quot;



    &quot;Perhaps luck had nothing to do with it, WarAvocat.  Till now.&quot;



    &quot;Luck has run out.  The Ku Question has run its course.  The symbol is
    about to receive its final blow.&quot;

                              <span>Tequila Works, the developer behind the likes of the sublime Rime and intriguing VR murder-mystery The Invisible Hours, has confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt will be going multiplatform next year.


Gylt, an enjoyably surreal horror yarn that follows the adventures of a young girl in search of her missing cousin, launched exclusively on Stadia back in 2019. And while Tequila Works did at one point suggest a multiplatform release might eventually be on the cards, it&#x27;s remained resolutely Stadia-bound in the years since.


However, following last week&#x27;s announcement that Google will be shutting down Stadia on 18th January next year - a move that prompted questions as to what might happen to the cloud gaming service&#x27;s handful of remaining exclusives - Tequila Works has confirmed Gylt will finally be getting a multiplatform release some time in 2023.

                              <span>CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński has announced he&#x27;ll be stepping down from his joint-CEO role - a position he&#x27;s held at the company for nearly 30 years - before the end of 2022.


&quot;I am beginning a brand-new personal chapter at CD Projekt,&quot; Iwiński wrote in a statement shared following the company&#x27;s latest investor meeting, &quot;as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint-CEO role. By the end of 2022, I&#x27;ll hand over my duties to my colleagues from the board.&quot;


&quot;For me this is a huge moment,&quot; Iwiński continued. &quot;I&#x27;ve been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognised developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by millions globally. Back when Michał Kiciński and I founded the company, I don&#x27;t think either of us would have been able to imagine this incredible journey, not even in our wildest dreams.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has revealed Sony&#x27;s first-party PlayStation releases will likely take &quot;at least a year&quot; to launch on PC, although live-service games might come sooner.


Sony initially confirmed it was exploring bringing its first-party PlayStation exclusives to PC in March 2020, announcing that Horizon Zero Dawn would lead the charge - although it said &quot;releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC&quot; and that it didn&#x27;t have plans to follow Xbox&#x27;s lead with day-and-date PC releases.


Since then, following the successful launch of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, the number of titles joining the platform has continued to grow. Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered have already made the jump, with Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: The Legacy Collection, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure confirmed to be on the way.

In anticipation of this release, we now finally have our first look at some gameplay, including seeing weapons such as the series&#x27; plasma cutter in action. Oh, yes, and there are also lots of gloriously detailed mutated human corpses littering the scene. Godspeed to you Isaac Clark!

                              <span>Sega has announced a three-month delay to Company of Heroes 3, which will now arrive on 23rd February 2023. 


Announcing the hold-up this afternoon, Sega said Relic Entertainment&#x27;s real-time strategy threequel was currently &quot;not quite up to our players&#x27; or our own high standards&quot;, with &quot;bugs to squash, pixels to polish, gameplay to adjust and feedback to address&quot;. 


On that last point, Sega says developer Relic is continuing to react to community feedback on improvements to the game&#x27;s dynamic campaign map, a stronger visual focus on &quot;grit and details&quot; during battles, an overhauled light system, plus tweaks to the HUD and UI.

                              <span>Psychological horror game The Medium is the latest in a long line of video games to be getting a TV adaptation. 


Bloober Team shared the news in a blog post earlier today, where the company announced it had signed a cooperation agreement with Polish visual arts complany Platige Image to bring its game to a new medium (see what I did there).


This upcoming adaptation will be helmed by Tomasz Bagiński, whose resume includes Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher. Meanwhile, Bloober Team&#x27;s Piotr Babieno will work alongside Bagiński bringing this adaptation to life.

                              <span>Sony has said it&#x27;s &quot;not unthinkable&quot; it will now develop film or TV versions of FromSoftware games following its recent increase in ownership of the Japanese developer.


At the end of August, both Sony and Chinese publisher Tencent increased their shareholding in the Elden Ring and Soulsbourne studio. Sony now owns just over 14 percent.


Now, speaking to Reuters, PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst has said the purchase opened up the possibility of FromSoftware properties getting the PlayStation Productions treatment.

                              <span>How much do you know about horses? I don&#x27;t know very much. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they really can do press-ups like Roach in The Witcher 3, or double-jump like Torrent in Elden Ring. 
Alice Ruppert knows a lot more about horses than I do. She&#x27;s been obsessed with them ever since she was a child. She would draw them, play games about them, and many years later she would eventually make games about them. 
How she got her horse-break in games makes for a great origin story. The way she tells it, she complained so much about bad horse representation in games that eventually someone gave her a job and told her to do better, and that&#x27;s what she&#x27;s doing now, making Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is coming out really soon.

Per The Washington Post, Activision Blizzard and the QA testers from Raven Software will now continue on with their negotiations to agree a collective bargaining agreement.
However, if the two parties can not settle upon an agreement, the NLRB can issue a complaint against Activision Blizzard. Another option would be for the NLRB to prosecute the case before a federal judge should the company refuse to settle, although this is deemed unlikely.

Officially, that is. 


Unofficially, we&#x27;ve glimpsed a leaked clip of early gameplay that doesn&#x27;t tell us a great deal, and there have been industry whispers to expect the game in December.

Last week, Colour shared a screenshot of his playtime in Red Dead Redemption 2 on Stadia on Twitter. In a follow-up tweet he tagged Rockstar, asking for a character transfer.

The pound, mercifully, is not yet affected - but many other countries will be. These include Poland, Sweden, Chile, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and Vietnam, plus Pokémon&#x27;s homeland of Japan - a core market for Pokémon Go.


And while the change is driven by Apple&#x27;s action, Niantic has said it will raise its prices in-game whether you use an iPhone or not.

                              <span>WWE 2K publisher Take-Two Interactive - as well as the WWE itself - have been ordered to pay damages to a tattoo artist whose designs appeared in multiple wrestling games. 


A jury has decided the companies must pay $3750 to Catherine Alexander, who designed tattoos for pro wrestler Randy Orton, after their likenesses appeared on Orton&#x27;s character in WWE 2K16, 17 and 18.


Alexander had pushed for a higher amount, including a share of profits from the games, Reuters reported. Still, the decision appears to mark a landmark judgement that may affect future usage rights in other games in future.

                              <span>The highest praise I can lay on Cookin&#x27; with Coolio: Five Star Meals at a One Star Price is that when I went to look for my copy the other day I realised I&#x27;d leant it out to someone and would probably never see it again.


This is the life of cook books, isn&#x27;t it? When they aren&#x27;t in the kitchen, getting splattered with hot sauce or providing a resting place for wooden spoons, they&#x27;re loaned around, pages marked, moving between hungry friends: you must read this! You must make this!


Cookin&#x27; with Coolio is where my mind went when I woke up one morning last week and learned that Coolio had died. Being a 90s person, I think this news would always bum me out. But having read and loved Coolio&#x27;s cook book, I&#x27;m ashamed to say it all struck a bit deeper. Over the following days when all these stories started to come out about how brilliant Coolio was - how kind, how thoughtful and perceptive and funny - none of that was really a surprise? Why? Because I had read Cookin&#x27; with Coolio.

                              <span>You didn&#x27;t hear it from me first, but Overwatch 2 is not Overwatch 2. It is Overwatch 2.0, a free-to-play rejig of the celebrated 2016 hero shooter with rebalanced characters, a sprinkling of new faces, modes and maps, and a predictably tedious seasonal Battle Pass system whereby unlocks are either paid for or ground out through match XP. 


Spend an hour with it and, tuned-up visuals notwithstanding, you might struggle to notice any difference beyond the charmless new monetisation elements. There&#x27;s the same delightful range of MOBA-ish abilities, the same awkward pivot between cultural archetype and dodgy stereotype in the character and cosmetic design, the same sunny ambience and brilliant tactical audio, and the same rousing premise of corpo-progressive Pixar Avengers murdering each other for possession of small wagons and courtyards.


Many of the game&#x27;s headline new bits are still to be developed or added, including the majority of new heroes and various much-trumpeted Player versus AI modes. I&#x27;ve not had much time with what does exist: the review period began in mid-September, but Eurogamer&#x27;s code arrived late last week, and my existing PS4 account hasn’t transferred over to the PC review build - obliging me to jump in as a First Time User and so, limiting my access to the game&#x27;s already-tiny pool of pre-release players. But enough of my petulant fist-waving! I’ll have a full review in a week or so - here are some provisional notes from the trenches.

                              <span>The WD SN550 is going cheap at Ebuyer&#x27;s Ebay UK page right now, with a 2TB drive costing just £118.98. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That&#x27;s about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

You can view the whole of October&#x27;s Steam Next Fest right here if you&#x27;d rather just dive in headfirst, but below you&#x27;ll find some hand-picked highlights we&#x27;ve been enjoying ahead of time - including a new Return Of The Obra Dinn-alike, a first-person skeleton shooter, an underwater citybuilders and a platformer where your gun is also an umbrella.

The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like &quot;Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim.&quot;
You can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It&#x27;s just, I am an idiot.

So far, Bungie, IO Interactive and Ubisoft have issued statements to reassure Stadia users that they’re investigating ways to salvage their saves. It’s a welcome development following Google’s sudden shutdown revelation.

                              <span>Fancy playing a new Legacy Of Kain game at some point in the indefinite future? Well, Crystal Dynamics are running a survey seeking opinions about where a hypothetical next instalment in the series might go. They’re also checking whether anyone would be up for remasters or remakes of earlier games, such as Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver. If you don’t enjoy the sound of a satirical co-op beat ‘em up set in the vampiric realm of Nosgoth then you might want to chime in with your thoughts.

                              <span>When action RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn was revealed in March, its cinematic trailer struggled to conjure up anything more than a slight tinge of excitement. Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the &quot;Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, and chat to A44&#x27;s CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I&#x27;d expected, honestly, and I&#x27;ve come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

                              <span>Six years after its launch, the original Overwatch is no more, with Blizzard having now forever pulled the plug on the game in preparation for Overwatch 2&#x27;s free-to-play arrival tomorrow.


Fans gathered earlier today to witness the final moments of Overwatch, recording the momentous occasion for posterity. Despite its place in the gaming pantheon, though, it met an unceremonious end, blinking out of existing with a simple &quot;disconnected&quot; message.


A few official lobby chat server messages did at least attempt to imbue the occasion with some import, telling players, &quot;Even the best journeys end, but a new one is right around the corner. Thank you, heroes! See you October 4th!&quot;. A final message ahead of Overwatch 1&#x27;s oblivion simply read, &quot;See you on the other side&quot;.

                              <span>With just a few months to go until the release of EA Motive&#x27;s intriguing Dead Space remake, the developer has confirmed it&#x27;ll be giving the spruced-up sci-fi horror its first proper gameplay reveal tomorrow, 4th October.


Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved 2008 original, once again putting players in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke as they journey through the Necromorph-infested mining ship USG Ishimura. This time, though, EA Motive is attempting to bolster the fear factor on modern systems with enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks including improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Since confirming a Dead Space remake was in the works last year, EA Motive has been unusually open about its development process, detailing the project&#x27;s progress in a series of livestreams focusing on gameplay changes, audio, and art.

                              <span>This month marks 25 years since the release of Bethesda&#x27;s much-loved post-apocalyptic RPG series Fallout, and the studio has now detailed its celebratory plans to mark the occassion, which includes making online spin-off Fallout 76 free to play for a week.


Fallout 76&#x27;s Free Play week kicks off tomorrow, 4th October, giving players on all platforms the chance to explore post-nuclear Appalachia without making a purchase until 11th October. Prime Gaming subscribers, meanwhile, can get the PC version of Fallout 76 for nowt as part of their membership, starting today, 3rd October, until 1st November.


Evidentally, the vast majority of Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout celebrations will be focused on Fallout 76, with the studio also set to give Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers a month of Fallout 1st - the paid membership service that includes access to the likes of private servers - via Xbox Game Pass Perks until 24th October.

                              <span>Retro Studios, the team behind Metroid Prime and Donkey Kong Country Returns, once pitched a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics.


This project was dubbed Heroes of Hyrule, and would not have had Link as the main character. Rather, the Hylian hero would have turned up as an NPC. 


Per YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming, which got its hands on Retro Studios&#x27; original pitch, Heroes of Hyrule would have told the story of a magical book.

When Black launched in 2006 for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it promised to be Criterion&#x27;s revolutionary take on the FPS genre - just as Burnout had won legions of fans for the studio&#x27;s version of racing. 


The game recieved largely positive reviews, though early plans for a sequel never materialised. Some who worked on the game, including its namesake Stuart Black, later left to make Bodycount - a spiritual successor developed by Codemasters.

                              <span>So, Stadia finally met its demise last week. After an unsuccessful launch with general apathy from the audience, there&#x27;s an argument that the platform was doomed right from the very beginning - despite Google itself investing a gigantic amount of cash into the hardware and various publishing deals. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Stadia shut down its own development studio, while the logical evolution of the platform - as a &#x27;white label&#x27; cloud system that could be used by publishers - wasn&#x27;t really compatible with the Linux/Vulkan foundation. Features failed to materialise (remember being able to access a game state by sharing a link?) while there were always doubts about the 10.7 teraflops of GPU power. If graphics performance was so high, how come Xbox One X at 6TF produced superior results? Was that GPU actually virtualised over two users? I&#x27;d love to know for sure.
The thing is, as many have stated, Stadia had much to commend it in terms of actually delivering a decent enough streaming experience - markedly better than xCloud in terms of quality. Regardless, the system did not attract much interest and it&#x27;s time to face realities about the actual viability of cloud-based platforms in general. 
Let&#x27;s start with the technological arguments first. Put simply, if the platform holder is not responsible for the quality of the experience from beginning to end, there will always be problems. I&#x27;ve tried Stadia and xCloud on a 30Mbps fibre connection - and they simply did not work. I upgraded to Starlink and that didn&#x27;t work either. Only now, with the arrival of fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) and gigabit internet does it actually work for me. My experience won&#x27;t be the case for everyone, but the point is, there&#x27;s no way to &#x27;debug&#x27; it and make it work. There are other technological limitations too in a bandwidth-constrained scenario - if I&#x27;m playing Stadia and someone else in the home decides to download a game or even just watch Netflix, there are going to be issues.

After six years of being one of the most popular multiplayer shooters, Overwatch has been retired ahead of Overwatch 2&#x27;s launch tomorrow.
The official Overwatch Twitter account invited players to share their memories and fan creations with the hashtag #SeeYouOnTheOtherSide to say their farewells, and plenty of fans have been getting involved online.

You can&#x27;t say fairer than that, surely. 


It&#x27;s been a year since we launched the Supporter program, and it&#x27;s seen the return of regular weekly podcasts, the Off-Topic series and Bertie&#x27;s wonderful One-to-One series where he&#x27;s profiled in-depth legends such as Ken and Roberta Williams and Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. 


For £1 (or $1, in a neat conversion thanks in part to our tanked economy) you&#x27;ll get Standard supporter access, which will give you the site ad-free as well as the weekly Essentials newsletter plus &#x27;Supporter&#x27; status on comments - so you can shout &#x27;slow news day?&#x27; with added authority. After the trial period it&#x27;s £3.99 per month for Standard Supporter status, with the Premium tier which opens up the bi-weekly Off-Topic pieces and early access to the Weekly and One-to-One podcasts coming in at £5.99.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been another busy year for No Man&#x27;s Sky. Not only has the exploratory space sim received three significant updates in 2022 - delivering some of the most meaningful revisions it&#x27;s yet seen its six years of post-launch support, developer Hello Games has been working behind-the-scenes on bringing the game to a number of new platforms in the not-too-distant future: Switch, PSVR2, iPad, and MacOS. Of those, Switch comes first, arriving on Nintendo&#x27;s console - alongside a major 4.0 update for all players - this Friday, 7th October. Ahead of release, Eurogaemr sat down with Hello Games boss Sean Murray to discuss the &#x27;madness&#x27; of porting to Switch, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s eagerly anticipated 4.0 update, the studio&#x27;s future, and more.

ON THE STATE OF THINGS IN 2022
 
Somewhat incredibly, it&#x27;s been over six years since No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s infamously rocky launch, during which time the studio has released a staggering 20 free updates, massively changing the trajectory of the game, both in terms of its scope and reception. &quot;In general,&quot; Murray tells me when I ask about the studio&#x27;s outlook in 2022, &quot;I think we&#x27;re a really happy team. I think we&#x27;re sort of the happiest and the most productive we&#x27;ve been in the last five or six years… The launch of No Man&#x27;s Sky, if I was to plot that on a graph, it was maximum stress, and there&#x27;s been a gradual but steady improvement year-on-year in how we do things and within the team. I think we&#x27;re enjoying it, you know.&quot;

                              <span>Sony is reportedly planning to make 2m units of its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset by March.

That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which has reported that mass production of the headset began last month.

These high production figures show Sony has an &quot;ambitious&quot; roadmap ahead of the VR2&#x27;s release, it was said.

                              <span>High-profile mod maker Lance McDonald has released footage of what looks to be a working PlayStation 5 exploit that leaves the console &quot;jailbroken&quot;. 


McDonald&#x27;s video appears to show custom code being read by a PS5 through an exploit in its online User Guide. Once run, the console is able to access debug settings and then install the infamous PT demo - which is, of course, no longer available under normal circumstances.


So, how bad is this for Sony? Well, for now, the use of this exploit is limited. Reportedly this method is still &quot;fairly unstable&quot; and offers &quot;read/write access, but no execute&quot; - so you could download the PT demo, for example, but not yet play it.

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it will shut down its cloud gaming service Stadia in January. While Google confirmed it will refund all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store, users have been left concerned about their in-game data. 


Thankfully, developers are trying to ensure these players are not going to see their efforts wasted when Stadia ultimately closes its doors.


Sharing an update on Twitter, Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it was currently &quot;looking into ways&quot; for its Google Stadia fans to &quot;continue [their] Hitman experience on other platforms&quot;.

Duke Nukem Forever, which finally released in 2011, previously held the Guinness World Record for the longest development period for a video game project, at just over 14 years. 


But Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has now beaten that, as noted on Twitter by GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Brendan Sinclair.

While, at the time of writing, it is unclear whether this is a &quot;from the ground up&quot; remake of the 2017 title, it is claimed that this version of Zero Dawn will see new character models, improvements to the game&#x27;s lighting system and animations, and &quot;overhauled textures&quot;.

This month I accepted 226 and rejected 33 packages. The overall number of packages that got accepted was 232.
All in all I addressed about 60 RM-bugs and either simply removed the package or added a moreinfo tag. In total I spent 5 hours for this task.
Anyway, I have to repeat my comment from last month: please have a look at the removal page and check whether the created dak command is really what you wanted. It would also help if you check the reverse dependencies and write a comment whether they are important or can be ignored or also file a new bug for them. Each removal must have one bug!
Debian LTS
This was my ninety-ninth month that I did some work for the Debian LTS initiative, started by Raphael Hertzog at Freexian.
This month my all in all workload has been 14h.

    Not a muscle moved on Rust&#x27;s face.  There was a clink as
    Vimes&#x27;s badge was set neatly on the table.



    &quot;I don&#x27;t have to take this,&quot; Vimes said calmly.



    &quot;Oh, so you&#x27;d rather be a civilian, would you?&quot;



    &quot;A watchman is a civilian, you inbred streak of pus!&quot;

                              <span>I recently upgraded my laptop to a Lenovo T14s Gen3 AMD and I am happy to report that it works just fine with Debian/unstable using a 5.19 kernel.
The only issue is that some firmware files are still missing and I had to install them manually.
Updates are needed for the firmware-amd-graphics package (#1019847) for the Radeon 680M GPU (AMD Rembrandt) and for the firmware-atheros package (#1021157) for the Qualcomm NFA725A Wi-Fi card (which is actually reported as a NFA765).
s2idle (AKA &quot;modern suspend&quot;) works too.
For improved energy efficiency it is recommended to switch from the acpi_cpufreq CPU frequency scaling driver to amd_pstate. Please note that so far it is not loaded automatically.
As expected, fwupdmgr can update the system BIOS and the firmware of the NVMe device.</span>

                              <span>As of late, the games industry has felt a little all over the place. We&#x27;ve seen countless acquisitions: Microsoft bought ActiBlizz, Sony acquired Valkyrie Entertainment, Quantic Dream was more recently acquired by Netease Games, and the list continues.
Acquisitions haven&#x27;t just been limited to the likes of developers and publishers, however, with the host of various fan wiki pages - Fandom - acquiring Giant Bomb, GameSpot, MetaCritic, GameFAQs, Comic Vine, Cord Cutters News, and TV Guide.
Fandom is something that&#x27;ll be familiar to most of us.

                              <span>It looks like Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries might be abandoning its custom Slipspace Engine for Unreal Engine.


This comes from journalist Jeremy Penter (thanks VGC), who wrote yesterday (October 2), &quot;I can only confirm that many sources are saying this and very clear that it&#x27;s already been decided and Halo is for sure switching to Unreal. I feel like it&#x27;s time for other switches behind the scenes including people leaving and their past problems. Unreal is a great choice.&quot;


It&#x27;s not uncommon for developers to switch engines if they find it isn&#x27;t working particularly well, like when Kingdom Hearts 3 switched from Square Enix&#x27;s quite at-the-time broken Luminous Engine to Unreal Engine 4. The awkward thing is that this engine was meant to power the future of the Halo series, which if the reports are true, clearly isn&#x27;t something it will be doing.

                              <span>Remember in Dead Space, if you messed up, you’d see your mentally deranged, long-suffering player avatar Isaac Clarke get impaled through the eye by a massive needle? Or fully decapitated by a horrible alien? Or sucked out into the vacuum of space without a helmet? It almost felt as if he were the plaything of a sadistic god; torturing him for the entertainment of an audience of PS3 and 360 players, safely tucked into a little nest on their sofas.

That level of sadism hasn’t gone away in Glen Schofield&#x27;s – co-creator of Dead Space and its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol. In fact, it seems like he’s eager to get even more indiscriminately violent, this time. In an interview with Mark James, chief technical officer at Striking Distance and second-hand man to Schofield, I learned that The Callisto Protocol wants you to die. A lot. And it even rewards you for seeing all the gruesome ways your new interactive plaything, one Jacob Lee, can be offed.

“This is a hard game, you are going to die a lot,” says James. “But in dying, at least, we can give you a cool way to go.”

                              <span>A game that was previously meant to have been an official Dune adaptation that was ultimately cancelled has been released under a fresh name 20 years later.


You might have heard about the upcoming open-world survival MMO based on the Dune series that&#x27;s slated for PC and current-gen consoles, but quite frankly it&#x27;s got nothing on the unreleased GBA game Elland: The Crystal Wars. Oh, you haven&#x27;t heard of Ellan? Well, there&#x27;s a small chance you might have heard its original name, Dune: Ornithopter Assault (thanks PCGamer).


Elland, as it is now known, was meant to come out in 2002 from Hungarian developed Soft Brigade, who was supposed to be working on it with Cryo Interactive. The problem? Cryo Interactive declared bankruptcy, meaning Ornithopter Assault was unfortunately cancelled, even though it was basically finished.

                              <span>Sony sounds like it&#x27;s gearing up for the eventual release of the PS VR 2, as it plans to make two million units by March next year.


This comes from Bloomberg, who says that people familiar with the situation provided them this information. Mass production apparently began last month (September), and as of yet there hasn&#x27;t been any supply chain issues. It&#x27;s also noted that the production figure might change depending on the headset&#x27;s sales momentum when it&#x27;s released early next year, whenever that might be.


According to the report, Sony&#x27;s roadmap for the PS VR 2 is predicting a much greater popularity than the original PS VR for the PS4. The company apparently hopes that big name titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain that draws on pre-established IP will bring players in, even with the general rise in living costs.

Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, and has been in development ever since. This 14-year-long period of development has managed to overtake the previous record holder, Duke Nukem Forever, which finally released in 2011 after having been announced in 1997.
The original game, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, launched in 2003 as a third-person action game. Coming from Michel Ancel, the mind behind the Rayman series, the game follows reporter and martial artist Jade as she attempts to uncover a sinister, ongoing alien plot.

                              <span>It appears that three members of Disco Elysium developer ZA/UM have &quot;involuntarily&quot; left the company.
This comes from a recent Medium post from Martin Luiga, co-founder and secretary of the ZA/UM cultural association. As a note: the post has announced that the ZA/UM cultural association has been dissolved. This association was an art collective, and was not directly responsible for development of the game, as ZA/UM the company still exists. In the post, Luiga also revealed that ZA/UM Studio founder and Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov haven&#x27;t been at the company &quot;since the end of last year.&quot;
Rostov later confirmed the news on his personal Twitter account writing, &quot;We confirm that we are no longer at the studio,&quot; on behalf of himself, Kurvitz, and Hindpere. Luiga noted in the post that the &quot;their leaving the company was involuntary,&quot; though didn&#x27;t elaborate much in the post about why this took place.

The report comes from MP1st, who claim that “a source close to the situation” has declared that Horizon Zero Dawn is being remade for PS5. It’s not yet clear, according to MP1st, whether this will be a remake or remaster. 
However, details were reportedly revealed that included an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, and enhanced animations. There’ll also supposedly be better character models to bring the title up to speed with its successor, Horizon Forbidden West.

                              <span>Google Stadia is officially dead, and now you can buy the official exhibit items that paired the platform with notorious failures such as the Dreamcast and Nintendo Power Glove.


For some reason, back at the Games Developer Conference in 2019, Google decided to put on a small exhibit that featured the E.T. game for Atari, the Sega Dreamcast, and the Nintendo Power Glove. The exhibit was meant to tease the Stadia, Google&#x27;s cloud-based platform, but the through line of these three icons of gaming is that they were all notable failures. And now, you can own these very items, with your money going towards The Video Game History Foundation!


As reported by Kotaku, VGHF founder Frank Cifaldi recently posted about these three items, as they were loaned to Google by the organisation. &quot;Remember when Google Stadia had that GDC display where they sat it next to three of gaming history&#x27;s most famous failures?&quot; wrote Cifaldi.

                              <span>I used to tell people to never mention Resident Evil 5 or 6 in my presence. There wasn’t any real reason, other than the fact that I’d previously felt these games were one big letdown for the whole Resident Evil series. This sentiment is shared by many, but over time – and as of today, 10 years since it was first released – I’ve come to appreciate Resident Evil 6. Even if I can’t get into it.
I was a child when I first picked up a copy of Resident Evil 6 from a market stall down an alley in Yorkshire. It definitely wasn’t legitimate, but a younger version of myself was fascinated by the cover art (little did I know what everyone else thought of it at the time) and all the Resident Evil gameplay I’d grown up watching, thanks to my parents. I was, by some margin, too young to play Resident Evil 6, but my dad let me get a copy anyway, and I instead was allowed to watch him play it. Seems like a win-win for him, if you ask me.
Later down the line, I tried it for myself on Xbox One after having played Resident Evil 7 and more recently on Nintendo Switch – only to drop the game within the first couple of hours. I did this on more than one non-consecutive occasion, bouncing off the game within a few hours each time. The control scheme felt more awkward than ever before, and if I wanted to complete constant QTEs I’d rather play something from The Dark Pictures Anthology. For the most part, playing Resident Evil 6 felt like a chore.

                              <span>No More Heroes 4 could happen, though series creator Suda51 says that fans would have to be really loud about it to get one.


While No More Heroes 3 was meant to be the last entry in the series, Suda51 hasn&#x27;t necessarily ruled out another game somewhere down the road, though it sounds like it would be quite a long road if it ever did happen. The director recently spoke with GNN about the most recent game, asking if it&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ll see Travis Touchdown once more. 


&quot;Yes, that’s right, Heroes No More 3 is Travis’ last battle,” Suda said (translations via VGC). &quot;Nobody could say what’s going to happen 10 years from now, and I can’t say either. If there’s a big fan outcry, Travis might be back. Just like Tom Cruise came back as Maverick.&quot;

                              <span>Ed Sheeran is back with another Pokémon collaboration, this time with a new song and a fun hybrid live-action animated music video.


If I had a nickel for everytime Ed Sheeran has collaborated with Pokémon, I&#x27;d only have two nickels, but it&#x27;s weird that it happened twice. Last time the ginger singer-songwriter appeared in the world of pocket monsters was in the mobile game Pokémon Go, where he held a special performance. This time it&#x27;s for a new song called Celestial, which for the most part sounds like your average Ed Sheeran song.


The music video itself doesn&#x27;t have too much of a story, and mostly just shows Sheeran going round parts of Richmond Hill, apparently, interspersed with animated bits of your favourite gen one Pokémon causing chaos, like setting his house on fire, or a Snorlax causing a taxi to literally go flying off into the sky.

                              <span>Another day, another leak that strongly suggests that Returnal is coming to PC, this time revealing the game&#x27;s PC settings, and also confirming Nvidia DLSS support.


There comes a point when something leaks so much that you&#x27;d assume an official reveal would just take place, regardless of the timeline. Not the case for Returnal, as a brand new leak is here, shared via a YouTube video in an icon-era forum post (thanks, PCGamesN). The video has been taken down now, but not before people could clock some of the settings in the video.


Settings apparently included things like shadows, lighting, ray tracing, as well as a &quot;screen optimisations&quot; toggle, all of which sounds pretty par for the course settings for a PC game. It was also spotted that the game has a Nvidia DLSS graphics option, which will require a Nvidia GeForce graphics card.

                              <span>Embark Studios has revealed what looks to be its first game, The Finals, an absolutely chaotic looking first-person shooter.


Revealed earlier this week, The Finals is a squad-based, free-to-play multiplayer shooter with inspiration from films like last year&#x27;s breakout hit Squid Game, and dystopian classic The Running Man. The first trailer gives off an impressive first look, with what looks to be completely destructible environments, and enemies that burst into coins when you take them down. And you can already sign up to take part in the game&#x27;s playtest, though the closed alpha is only running until tomorrow, October 3.


According to the studio&#x27;s creative director Gustav Tilleby, The Finals is &quot;a hero builder, not a hero shooter,&quot; going on to say the team wants &quot;to build a game that provides players with the tools to meaningfully interact, change, and use their world. So, this is a shooter; it’s a game where aiming and shooting is important. But it’s also a game where the players can use the environment, and adapt to changes in the environment&quot; (thanks, Polygon).

                              <span>Lots of pre-release video games suffer the fate of becoming the subject of memes. Assassin’s Creed has come under fire for melting NPC faces, and many a ‘visual downgrade’ has launched campaigns of know-it-all fans to drone on about despicable devs. But one of the funniest of all time is this week turning a decade old: Resident Evil 6’s logo.

The logo, of course, is quite innocuous in nature. Resident Evil is a game about viruses, and the logo is meant to resemble a virus under a microscope or whatever. I get it. I see it. But back in the run-up to Resident Evil’s release, people saw something else entirely.
They saw a giraffe, being fellated by a doubled-over figure. And now I’ve said it, even those of you who weren’t terminally online in 2012 probably see it too. The giraffe BJ logo cannot be unseen, like a debauched Rorschach test.

                              <span>Ubisoft has revealed a new co-op shooter currently titled Project U, and you can sign-up to playtest it now.


Details on this Project U are currently very vague, with the game&#x27;s page saying that Ubisoft has &quot;been exploring a new concept of session-based co-op shooter, where many players unite to prevail against an overwhelming threat!&quot; You probably couldn&#x27;t be less clear than that on pitching a game, considering that&#x27;s an age old concept.


A piece of concept art has been shown off which you can see above, which is admittedly quite pretty, with the character designs having a toned-down Apex Legends vibe. The characters seem to be facing off against some kind of robot army, but aside from that we probably won&#x27;t know more until Ubisoft shows off more (or someone leaks the closed test gameplay).

                              <span>Legacy of Kain could see some kind of return, as a recent survey from Crystal Dynamics is asking fans about the series.


Earlier this year, Square Enix sold off a number of its IPs and a few of its studios to Embracer Group, which included the rights to Legacy of Kain, as well as Crystal Dynamics. Of course, that led some fans to hope that this could mean some kind of revival for the series, as what better time is there than now? Well, Kain fans might be in luck, as Crystal Dynamics has released a survey (which you can fill in here) asking some questions that certainly make it seem like it&#x27;s interested in bringing the series back.


The survey asks a variety of questions about the series, obviously, and if like me you haven&#x27;t played the games but have heard of them, it does ask why you haven&#x27;t. It also more vaguely asks you about vampire games as a whole, and what kind of features in vampire games you enjoy.

                              <span>PlayStation Stars has just launched in Asia, but some players are unhappy that top members are reportedly being given &quot;priority&quot; support.


First announced back in July, PlayStation Stars has now launched in Asia this week, with the confirmation that the loyalty program will come to North America and Europe in October. However, as reported by VGC, top members of the program are supposedly being given priority when it comes to customer support, which a number of players aren&#x27;t happy with.


PlayStation Stars apparently has a four tier system that players can progress through by purchasing games and earning trophies. The fourth and highest tier requires you to buy four full-price games on the PlayStation and accrue 128 rare trophies. If a player manages to do this, they&#x27;ll net a commemorative collectible, and according to Sony, &quot;when contacting PlayStation Customer Support,&quot; tier four players &quot;will be given priority in the chat order.&quot;

                              <span>Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra and scientific computing. It aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use, has a syntax deliberately close to Matlab, and is useful for algorithm development directly in C++, or quick conversion of research code into production environments. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 1023 packages other packages on CRAN, downloaded 26.4 million times (per the partial logs from the cloud mirrors of CRAN), and the CSDA paper (preprint / vignette) by Conrad and myself has been cited 497 times according to Google Scholar.
This release reflect as new upstream release 11.4.0 Conrad made recently. It turns out that it triggered warnings under g++-12 for about five packages in the fortify mode default for Debian builds. Conrad then kindly addressed this with a few fixes.
The full set of changes (since the last CRAN release 0.11.2.4.0) follows.
Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.11.4.0.1 (2022-10-01
Upgraded to Armadillo release 11.4.0 (Ship of Theseus)
faster handling of compound expressions by sum()


extended pow() with various forms of element-wise power operations


added find_nan() to find indices of NaN elements


Also applied fixes to avoid g++-12 warnings affecting just a handful of CRAN packages.



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.

Voting closed last night and we have
a result!
This is unofficial so far - the official result will
follow shortly when the Project Secretary sends a signed mail to
confirm it. But that&#x27;s normally just a formality at this point.
A Result!
The headline result is: Choice 5 / Proposal E
won: Change
SC for non-free firmware in installer, one installer. I&#x27;m
happy with this - it&#x27;s the option that I voted highest, after
all. More importantly, however, it&#x27;s a clear choice
of direction, as I was hoping for. Of the 366 Debian Developers who
voted, 289 of them voted this option above NOTA and 63 below, so it
also meets the 3:1 super-majority requirement for amend…</span>

So far cards featuring Optimus Prime, Starscream, Soundwave, Slicer, Goldbug, and Flamewar have been confirmed, and will reportedly be available in The Brothers&#x27; War sets, as well as Bundle Box and collector boosters, too.

                              <span>A GTA 5 player who failed their in-game driving test is only using public transport to get around Los Santos. 

After failing their San Andreas driving test, redditor MotorDesigner reached out to the GTA subreddit for advice on the best way to get around the city without a car - legally, in other words, even though the concept is comically novel in any GTA game, of course.

Admittedly, the in-game driving test doesn&#x27;t look too troublesome - questions include when it&#x27;s permissible to run a red light, what the correct driving position is, and how best to drive when &quot;getting serviced orally by a girl while driving&quot; - MotorDesigner failed to meet the San Andreas Department of Motor Vehicles&#x27; low, low standards, and therefore cannot drive legally in the city.

Bloomberg reports that Townsend - who also serves as executive vice president of corporate affairs - will step down ahead of Microsoft&#x27;s billion pound deal to acquire Activision (if it goes through, of course).

Townsend will, however, remain with the company as an advisor to the board and CEO Bobby Kotick, although his future at the company is also in doubt if and when the acquisition goes through.

                              <span>Chinese megacorp Tencent is reportedly &quot;resetting its mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) strategy&quot; by focussing on &quot;buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies&quot;.

According to Reuters, Tencent traditionally acquired minority stakes and was content with being a &quot;passive financial investor&quot;, but it is now &quot;aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets&quot;, chiefly in the &quot;core gaming sector&quot;. Metaverse assets are also reportedly of interest to Tencent. 

Citing &quot;four people with direct knowledge of the matter&quot;, Reuters adds that the shift in Tencent&#x27;s M&amp;A strategy &quot;comes as the world&#x27;s number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games&quot; and follows regulatory issues in its home country.

                              <span>Kinetic Games - the indie team behind massive ghost hunting sim Phasmophobia - has been accused of &quot;housing a sex pest&quot; on its official Discord server.

In a series of messages shared on Twitter, Dandy @ 6.2 –  who clarifies that they are &quot;not a victim in this&quot; but is &quot;speaking out for a friend who IS a victim who otherwise felt like she had no voice&quot; – posts a number of incriminating messages that intimate that despite reporting him, the alleged &quot;sex pest&quot; known as Charcoal Salamander had yet to be stripped of his &quot;admin&quot; role on the server. 

&quot;So who else knew that the Phasmophobia devs are housing a sex pest in their official discord by keeping him admin and refusing to take any claims against him seriously because I sure do now,&quot; tweeted Dandy @ 6.2.

                              <span>One of the founding members of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM has revealed that several members of the team have left, and &quot;their leaving the company was involuntary&quot;.

In a succinct yet puzzling Medium post, Martin Luiga – a founding member of ZA/UM and seeming &quot;secretary of the ZA/UM cultural association&quot; – revealed that designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov haven&#x27;t worked at the company &quot;since the end of last year&quot;, &quot;which would seem like bad news for the loving fans that are waiting for the Disco sequel&quot;, Luiga said.

The codex entries are included with an interview between two members of the game’s narrative team, Ryan Cormier and Sylvia Feketekuty who discuss the writing process for the next game in the series.
The first entry, Misconceptions about the Necropolis, comes from what appears to be a diary entry. The diary could indicate players will be heading to Nevarra, but Bioware doesn&#x27;t specifically state whether this will indeed be the case.

According to Ubisoft, it is currently working on Stadia users being able to transfer their games to PC through Ubisoft Connect. A timeline for the option wasn&#x27;t specified, but the company said specific details will come at a later date.

Entitled War Games: Real Conflicts | Virtual Worlds | Extreme Entertainment, the exhibition is running from now until May 2023 and seeks to &quot;delve into one of today’s most popular storytelling mediums and ask how the reality of war is represented in the virtual world of a video game&quot;. 

&quot;Featuring 12 diverse case studies, War Games invites visitors to interrogate the tension that exists between the thrill and tragedy of warfare in a game and its repercussions in the real world,&quot; a press release says.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s recent revival includes an uptick in players jumping into Night City on Steam Deck.

According to stats shared by Valve, Cyberpunk 2077 is the fourth most popular game on Steam Deck by total hours played, topped only by Stardew Valley, Elden Ring, and Vampire Survivors - in that order. 

We&#x27;ve already told you about Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s second life. Cyberpunk 2077 initially shifted 13m copies when it arrived for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in December 2020, but interest in the game dropped when word of its technical issues spread.

                              <span>In a weird way, I feel ever so slightly sorry for the team of students who made Dorfromantik. Call it Joseph Heller Syndrome: first time out and they&#x27;ve made a classic. Does that leave them confused? Fearful? I suspect not, and this is why I only feel ever so slightly sorry for the team. The bad news is they&#x27;ve made something that will be hard to top, but the good news is that they have made something that will be hard to top. They have brought happiness to hundreds of thousands of us around the world. That kind of feeling sticks around, I think.


I play Dorfromantik an awful lot. It&#x27;s a hex-based tile game about making landscapes. You get a stack of tiles with little rivers, train tracks, forests, villages, grass or farmland on, and you plonk them down. Quests appear to connect certain amounts of a certain type of landscape, and these quests, once fulfilled, give you more tiles. Eventually, though, you run out. Game over. Defeat? Not really, because you&#x27;ve been making a landscape all this time, worrying about the details, and once you&#x27;re out, the landscape is finished. You get to see the whole thing as if for the first time. You made that!


Dorfromantik has just landed on Switch, which explains why I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing at the moment. I&#x27;m trying to unlock the Midwinter biome. Biomes are unlockable prizes that give the landscape a certain colour scheme or vibe. Midwinter does what you&#x27;d expect it to: it makes it look like winter. But more than that it transports me to Christmas, and to the bookshelves where the Christmasest book of all time lives, John Masefield&#x27;s The Box of Delights. Christmas in the countryside! Dorfromantik is the most Masefield game of all time when you&#x27;re playing with Midwinter. You hover above the landscape, above the woods and fields and little copses. I feel a bit like Santa.

                              <span>Dome Keeper divides me. There&#x27;s a part of me, each time I play, that&#x27;s really happy to return, to feel the ground give under my drill, to hoist my mined resources triumphantly to my command centre and turn them into upgrades to improve my base. This time, I tell myself, I will build better and survive longer and make my dome&#x27;s defences impenetrable. This run will be the one.
Then, inevitably, it isn&#x27;t. Just as I get some real momentum going, a particularly savage wave of shadowy monsters overwhelms me, from both the air and ground, and my precious dome cracks and breaks and I am done for. Game over, try again. And the other part of me is peeved it failed. But I know this is how it goes, that these games are about trial and error and experimentation, and feeling your way to winning combinations of upgrades, so I grit my teeth and excavate the ground beneath my dome again.
But each time I repeat the cycle, some of the sheen fades, because the core activity in the game, digging, doesn&#x27;t really change. Every time I face it anew, it feels more like the laborious work it is, and I know it will be a while before I unlock the upgrades that make light of it. And just as I do, just as I build up that sense of momentum again, the inevitable overwhelming wave of enemies comes and I am dead again, and my willingness to start over wanes.

specifically those created by master craftsman Tim
Pope. Off and on since then I&#x27;ve reviewed
the other plugins I use and tried a few others, so I thought I&#x27;d

automatic colour name colouring
vim-css-color is a simple plugin that
recognised colour names specified in CSS-style: e.g. &#x27;red&#x27;, &#x27;#ff0000&#x27;,
&#x27;#rgb(255,0,0)&#x27; etc., and colours them accordingly. True to its name,
once installed it&#x27;s active when editing CSS files, but it&#x27;s also supported
 for many other file types, and extending it further is not hard.</span>

                              <span>The diffoscope maintainers are pleased to announce the release of diffoscope
version 223. This version includes the following changes:

[ Chris Lamb ]
* The cbfstools utility is now provided in Debian via the coreboot-utils
  Debian package, so we can enable that functionality within Debian.
  (Closes: #1020630)

[ Mattia Rizzolo ]
* Also include coreboot-utils in Build-Depends and Test-Depends so it is
  available for the tests.

[ Jelle van der Waa ]
* Add support for file 5.43.

                              <span>It’s an odd full-circle moment for me that the least surprising bombshell news of all time – Stadia’s unceremonious cancellation – lands just a week out from EGX. The Eurogamer Expo (as it was still called back then) of 2011 was more or less the start of my career in games coverage, and it started when I managed to get an interview with OnLive’s Senior Vice President John Spinale, a smooth-talking American businessman of the kind I had up to that point only encountered via the medium of television. And always as a villain, even in shows produced by smooth-talking American businessmen.


Spinale, though, was extremely nice. He could tell I’d never interviewed anyone before, and knew how to set people at ease. Within seconds, it felt like a normal chat with someone you met down the pub. The sheer gulf of wealth disparity between us didn’t seem to matter. John was excited to tell me about OnLive, this strange new concept that was going to disrupt the gaming business, and I was excited to hear about it.


It was, and is, a brilliant concept, and the basic pitch for OnLive pretty much applies to the Stadia platform which died a decade later: imagine never having to buy new hardware. That was the first thing that appealed to me, a potless call centre worker at the time, who saw the looming new generation of consoles as less of an exciting new future and more of a £400 tax on joy.

The Dragonflight expansion takes you to the Dragon Isles, where you will explore four new zones themed around the dragon aspects: the Waking Shores, the Ohn’ahran Plains, the mountainous Azure Span, and the Thaldraszus.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol gets constantly compared to Dead Space – and it makes sense, really. A lot of the developers are the same, a lot of the core ideas are the same, and it even looks quite similar, really. But this new venture from young developer Striking Distance is doing more with its horror than Dead Space could back in 2008; we’re 14 years down the line, now, and technology has come a long way. 

Striking Distance really cares a lot about horror. The staff have been ruthless in studying the psychology of fear, and have boiled down the tenets of human dread to how we respond to atmosphere, tension, brutality, helplessness, and humanity. Taking each of these five strands and tinkering with them individually, Striking Distance reckons it’s made one of the scariest games ever made – no matter what your own personal tolerance for horror is.
Why is the developer so confident? A lot of it comes down to its tech. Mark James, chief technical officer at the studio, tells me in an interview that new-gen games can do things that just weren’t possible, even a few years ago. Whilst “50% of horror is in audio,” James assures me that a large portion of The Callisto Protocol’s dread comes from its, frankly, sadistic AI.

At the time of this writing, the game has nearly 1,500 reviews on Steam. The overall rating is currently sitting at Mostly Negative, which is not a good look.
Looking at the reviews themselves, there are two main issues that keep cropping up. The first has to do with the game&#x27;s anti-cheat software, which errors out for some players when launching the game. Without the anti-cheat running in the background, you won&#x27;t be able to play FIFA 23.

                              <span>It’s now official, and irrefutable: Lego is no longer just for children. This has always been the case, of course, but in recent years the company itself has started to embrace this fact. First there was ‘Creator Expert’, a line of larger, more complicated and expensive sets. Then came adult-driven packaging, signaled by sleek black boxes and a marketing campaign that gleefully declares ‘Adults Welcome’. Like a lot of the best kids’ toys, Lego is for kids first – but is perfectly good for adults, too.

The Lego Group’s latest foray into the world of sets aimed at those hurtling towards their middle age at alarming speed is set 10306, the Atari 2600. This is exactly what you think it is – an almost but not quite real-life scale model of one of the most significant consoles in gaming history, dating all the way back to 1982.
Truth be told, the 2600 is quite a bit before my time (my first console was a Mega Drive), but I’m nevertheless definitely squarely in this set’s target audience: a video game nerd who also loves and collects complex-scale Lego, with an appreciation for the artistry of the older video game consoles. I mean, the machine has a wood grain finish, for goodness sake. You just don’t get that any more.

                              <span>It’s no news that Dead Space — the 2008 horror sci-fi classic — is being remade for modern consoles. What is news, however, is how the Dead Space Remake is going to play out.
In a recent blog post shared on EA’s website, those interested can delve into ‘Inside Dead Space #1: Remaking a Classic’, in which Motive explains what it believes is key to bringing back and remaking such an iconic title.
First things first, the most important thing for Motive is to stay true to the original title, and this is without a doubt, what many fans of the original Dead Space are looking for. Senior producer Philippe Ducharme says, “We look at the original game with the utmost respect.”

                              <span>It’s Barking, 1978. We’re playing an away match against the Under 9 Tigers, and I’m in goal, being the team’s only goalkeeper, and despite my repeated request for new kneepads being consistently denied. “Ain’t got the funds, lad” was the constant refrain from the manager, Keith, ever clad in his suede coat, gold chains, and cashmere polo neck: the standard uniform at the time of people who had large status in small towns.
Last minute penalties. Unprotected joints. A striker four years my senior, having been kept back several years in school on account of his behavioural issues. Why his academic progression was reflected by the local football league is and will remain a mystery, but you must accept it for the purposes of this narrative. The point is: he was three times my size, and his legs were pneumatic pistons that could boot my head clean off and barely notice.
Mercifully, he booted the ball, rather than my skull, which was saved from his kinetic anger only by virtue of not being the object on the ground in front of him. The ball soared toward the back of the net, and would have punched a hole through the stand and into the dry cleaners across the main road outside, were it not for my left knee. My unprotected left knee. Which, as it happens, did not impede the ball’s journey into the net.

                              <span>Admittedly, my expectations for NieR: Automata on the Nintendo Switch were quite low. I love Nintendo’s handheld more than most, picking it up near enough every day, but I’m also quite accustomed to it’s limited performance capabilities (as anyone that picked up Dark Souls on the platform will tell you).
So, when I had the opportunity to play NieR:Automata on Switch this past week, I began the download with a quiver of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ to hand. Yet, while I’m only about eight hours into Yoko Taro’s unsettling masterpiece, I can’t wait to see it through to the end (or 26 ends, in this case).
Just yesterday, we saw the Anniversary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim come to Switch, and this is one of many huge titles that has been ported to the handheld since its release in 2017. There’s also Dark Souls, Wolfenstein, and The Witcher 3, to name but a few triple-A juggernauts on the hybrid home console/handheld device. If you’ve picked any of these games up, you’ll know that they certainly feel compromised on the Switch compared to other platforms.

                              <span>Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life&#x27;s biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren&#x27;t your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they&#x27;re all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station&#x27;s head clerk, you&#x27;ll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It&#x27;s certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

There aren’t many details to go on just yet, but the game is in the early stages of development and will hold closed playtests on PC in Western Europe. If you’re of an inquiring mind, and like hanging out with mates in shooter lobbies, then all you can do for the moment is register your interest.

                              <span>Developers working on games for Stadia have expressed surprise and frustration that Google still haven&#x27;t made contact with them, almost 24 hours after the search giant announced they were shutting down their cloud gaming service yesterday afternoon. Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It&#x27;s not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google&#x27;s own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

Imagine Nidhogg, cross it with Webbed, give it solid single player options, and throw in one of the sickest game soundtracks I&#x27;ve ever heard. I&#x27;d hoped Spiderheck would merely be as fun as it looks. It instead consumed me. Neverjam have united my love for Webbed with my love for chaos, and it&#x27;s more glorious than I dared to hope.

                              <span>Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn&#x27;t arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I&#x27;ve been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it&#x27;s put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

                              <span>December’s a month known for its white-haired, bearded men in weird outfits and hats, so it seems a fitting time of year for Slitherine Games to launch their remake of 4X strategy classic Master Of Magic. Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

                              <span>Out Of Hands is a fairly &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot; title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can&#x27;t say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill &quot;a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I&#x27;m pretty cut up about that&quot; story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn&#x27;t find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin&#x27; plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio&#x27;s Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re able to fuse together any monsters you &#x27;catch&#x27;, but moreso because it&#x27;s a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It&#x27;s looking mighty promising.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year&#x27;s Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn&#x27;t quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It&#x27;s the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other &#x27;deadly games&#x27; you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she&#x27;s teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you&#x27;ll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each &#x27;episode&#x27;. It&#x27;s a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. &quot;He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,&quot; creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. &quot;He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.&quot;

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the failure of Stadia, and why Google&#x27;s cloud gaming gamble struggled from the start.


The announcement of Stadia&#x27;s demise came as a shock to some - including many developers with titles only weeks from launch - yet still feels like it was on the cards for some time. After a rocky launch and the closure of Google&#x27;s internal game development studios, what future did Stadia have left? Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson weighed in earlier today with his thoughts.

Could Stadia have been a success? What does this all mean for game preservation? And if Google failed, with all of its billions, what future does cloud gaming have elsewhere? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, and Liv Ngan share their thoughts.

                              <span>A lifelong Nintendo fan has decided to make a realistic Super Mario Bros remake, and posted a movie-style trailer on YouTube to document their most recent update.

The YouTuber, who has uploaded their videos to the channel Re-Imagined Games, started work on the remake over two months ago.

In order to create the game, they&#x27;ve had to learn Unreal Engine 5 with zero experience in video game development.

                              <span>Google reportedly turned down a Stadia exclusive follow-up to Hideo Kojima&#x27;s Death Stranding.


According to a new report from 9to5google, the project received initial approval but as it was intended to be a strictly single-player experience (instead of the asynchronous multiplayer in Death Stranding), the Kojima collaboration was cancelled as Google believed there was no longer a market for solo games.



Despite reaching the early stages of development, the project was reportedly cancelled by Stadia&#x27;s general manager Phil Harrison in mid 2020 following the first mockups.

The sci-fi game from developer Superbrothers A/V was released a year ago on PlayStation consoles and PC, but if you&#x27;re yet to play it a demo will be available as part of Steam&#x27;s Next Fest from 3rd October.

These tidbits are not meant to tease any particular storyline from Dreadwolf, but are included in a blog post detailing how BioWare&#x27;s writing team works together to build Dragon Age&#x27;s expansive world. 


The first codex entry presented here comes from a character&#x27;s diary - someone who, if we had to guess, is likely one of your new companions.

Elevated Chat, as it&#x27;s known, is currently a limited time experiment for four weeks only available for select streamers.


It allows viewers to pay to &quot;elevate&quot; their message in chat, either pinned to the top of chat or at the bottom of the video player. Varying payment amounts allows for various amounts of time for elevation.

                              <span>Some console reveals just hit different. I remember queuing around the sun-drenched, weed-stench streets around San Francisco&#x27;s Moscone Centre to get into GDC 2019&#x27;s big Stadia show, the crazy rumours that spin up in the line for events like these - maybe it was the effect of that heavy smoke in the air, but someone told me Google had paid Sega big money to get a new OutRun as an exclusive, and I was somehow convinced - soon punctured by the bizarre reality.
Outside the hall, in an ominous show of forbearance as well as an example of how ill-conceived some of Google&#x27;s ideas were, was assembled some of video game&#x27;s most famous failures, with four plinths displaying a Dreamcast, Nintendo&#x27;s Powerglove and Atari&#x27;s ET with the final display left empty with a simple &#x27;Coming Soon&#x27; for the soon-to-be-announced Stadia. Amidst all the bluster that would follow, it was the one thing from that event that would ring true. 
It&#x27;s easy to be cynical about Stadia, and there was plenty of scepticism going around at the time of its reveal. Google&#x27;s track record with product launches is spotty at best, with a rich history of big ideas being introduced before being tossed aside out of apparent boredom. The level of investment with Stadia, though, was simply bonkers. Millions was paid out to secure big blockbusters like Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Cyberpunk 2077, while exclusives were secured from such talented studios as Q-Games, Splash Damage and Tequila Works. It felt, for a short while, that Google was taking this all very seriously - and how exciting it was to have a genuine new player in the game.

Quality assurance tester Mackenzie Clifton has spoken publicly to Axios about their departure from Nintendo of America, and revealed both the question on unionisation they asked, as well as the &quot;confidential information&quot; they were accused of leaking. 


During a January company Q&amp;A with Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser, Clifton says they submitted the following question: &quot;What does NoA think about the unionisation trend in QA in the games industry as of late?&quot;

                              <span>With the news of Google shutting down Stadia comes a major question: what games might we lose?


There weren&#x27;t many exclusive games available on the streaming service, but with game preservation continuing to be a hot topic, there are a number of games at risk unless they&#x27;re ported to other platforms.


Yesterday Google announced the end of Stadia, its cloud-based streaming service. Despite ambitions of creating exclusive games, in 2021 its internal studios were closed leaving third-party developers to provide the games.

Currently, the Stadia controller can only be used through Stadia, which itself is only compatible with a limited number of devices. 

In the Stadia announcement FAQ, it is stated that &quot;most hardware purchases... made directly from Google will not need to be returned&quot;, including Stadia controllers.

Google&#x27;s announcement yesterday that it would shutter Stadia completely in January 2023 came as a complete surprise, all have said - even those with upcoming projects set to arrive in November. 


What will happen to those games is now unclear, as Google has already moved to close the Stadia store - making new releases unsellable.

                              <span>Transparency alert: EGX is run by Eurogamer owner ReedPop. 
There was a nice buzz about EGX London this past weekend, a whiff of positivity about it, at people being back together, relatively unimpeded by the pandemic and playing games together again. EGX felt much more like its old self. And many of us were there, walking the halls, hosting quizzes (thank you if you came to one), and playing games.
And what games there were: big ones, small ones, old ones, new ones. One of the most eye-catching instalments was a pool table with an enormously warped corner, curving up into the air, and which made playing it feel completely different to normal. Amazing what one simple change can do.

The lengthy RPG has been available on Google&#x27;s Stadia platform, but now that&#x27;s shutting down, players will no longer have access to their save files without cloud support.


However, it seems players may have found a work around.

                              <span>Skateboarding is hard. Really damn hard. The journey to mastery is one counted in years - or even decades.


Landing a kickflip while moving along? Sure, today there are wildly more complex tricks out there, but it&#x27;s still a tremendous achievement. It takes hours of investment and a deep resilience to failure to get there. But the moment you pop the board high, flick it with a foot just enough to spin once beneath you, and successfully commit to the landing, the reward is immense. It&#x27;s not an achievement recompensed in any kind of currency like score. Rather, to succeed is more than enough of a payoff.


That is the mindset that has clearly founded the design of Session: Skate Sim. Certainly, it is not as hard as real skateboarding, but this is a game that is profoundly challenging, and one that makes you think like a skateboarder. The clue is in the name. Developer creā-ture Studios has strived to deliver a skateboarding simulator. In doing so, they&#x27;ve built something that does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of real skating; even if that approach sometimes comes at the expense of what makes for a consistently enjoyable video game. To deconstruct what that means, the conversation inevitably starts with an iconic series.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a game as pretty as Horizon Forbidden West. The environments feel unreal in their beauty, while the details and textures on character models and clothing are incredible. All this stunning work does mean any imperfections are very distracting though - can someone please explain why Aloy’s hair is seemingly made of wool?

It was nice to be back playing games together relatively unimpeded by the pandemic, and the show is feeling much more like its old self again. But what caught our eye there?


That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking to my two Weekly guests Martin Robinson and Liv Ngan about today. What did Liv think of Wo Long, did Martin like Street Fighter 6, and why was everyone talking about new card game Wildfrost?


Elsewhere in today&#x27;s show, I catch us up on some of the reviews we&#x27;ve missed while we&#x27;ve been away - sorry for the gap in our programming, but I&#x27;ve had some time off - before getting onto what will probably be the hot topic of the week: the FIFA 23 review. It&#x27;s the final FIFA-branded game, and there&#x27;s a lot to both like, and loathe, about it.

                              <span>A little over six months after its big reveal, World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion has been given a release date, with its launch now officially scheduled for 28th November this year.


As detailed back in April, Dragonflight&#x27;s first major addition is a new location known as the Dragon Isles, the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind. This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn&#x27;ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player&#x27;s chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.

                              <span>Google is shutting down Stadia, with the beleaguered cloud gaming service set to remain live for players until 18th January 2023.


Stadia&#x27;s misfortunes are, of course, well-documented; despite initial praise for the service&#x27;s streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia&#x27;s failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.


And while Google continued to insist Stadia was &quot;alive and well&quot; as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had &quot;deprioritised&quot; the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services&#x27; underlying technology to third-parties.

                              <span>Released earlier in the year, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection brought the PlayStation 4-era franchise entries to the new PS5, with some mild enhancements to the overall presentation and a major focus on resolutions and performance. 4K at 30fps, 1440p at 60fps and 1080p at 120fps effectively allowed you to balance pixel count and frame-rate whichever way you wanted. These choices are now even wider thanks to a recent 120Hz VRR patch, which delivers some great results.


While the Naughty Dog titles deploy state of the art rendering, thus far the studio has not embraced dynamic resolution rendering to balance performance - not even in its latest title, The Last of Us Part One. So, in theory at least, the PS5&#x27;s GPU is not fully maxed out. To be clear, the new patch 1.002 does not add this feature, but via VRR upgrades it taps into that latent GPU power by offering the ability to unlock frame-rate, while also adding a 40fps fidelity mode. This works in a similar manner to the option seen in Ratchet and Clank, the Spider-Man titles and Horizon Forbidden west. 


The new 40fps option replaces the 30fps fidelity mode when you boot the game with 120Hz output enabled on your PS5. In addition to that is an unlocked version of the same mode, leveraging VRR to deliver a smooth experience with a variable frame-rate. Visually speaking, this is a match for the old fidelity mode - both render at a crisp native 4K resolution, with the same capable treatment of fine detail. Even in the most intense scenes, a straight 3840x2160 pixel count seems to be in play - there&#x27;s still no DRS, meaning that effectively, we&#x27;re &#x27;hoping&#x27; there&#x27;s at least 10fps of clearance once the frame-rate cap is increased.

The highlight of this new investment package is 50bn riyals (£12bn) earmarked for the acquisition of &quot;a leading game publisher to become a strategic development partner,&quot; according to the state&#x27;s press agency.  


Another 70 billion riyals (£16bn) is pegged for minority stakes in other companies, while the rest will be spent targeting industry disruptors and mature industry partners to enhance Savvy&#x27;s portfolio.

The little bar in the top-right of the screen strobes to tell me I&#x27;ve completed an objective. Nice! Objectives in Ultimate Team range from simple things like scoring a certain number of goals, to more complex tasks like doing so with assists from specific players or winning dozens of times. They give you rewards, usually in the form of XP that advances FIFA&#x27;s version of a battle pass, where you unlock more rewards by progressing through the levels. So, completing an objective is expected after a couple games, and generally it&#x27;s neat. 


Only, I haven&#x27;t completed an objective. I have, after two games and nothing else, completed 26 objectives. And these objectives are scattered across five sub-m…</span>

                              <span>Shenmue: The Animation, which got its debut season in February, has been cancelled. 


The anime adaptation of the cult classic Sega game was first announced back in September 2020, before being broadcasted and available to stream on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll respectively.  


A second season was reportedly in the works before the cancellation, which is likely a part of the wider purge by Warner Discovery of its properties following the merger of the two media conglomerates in April this year.

                              <span>Hello! With Dorfromantik landing on Switch today, here&#x27;s a piece from Jay that takes a closer look at landscapes. If you&#x27;re interested in the Switch port itself, we&#x27;re running a piece on Saturday.


I can’t ever get my Dorfromantik dioramas to look quite right. Other people seem to be able to make their rural idylls look balanced, organised. Villages and farms are rounded while rivers gently meander. For me, it’s the other way around. Rivers stagnate in huge lakes while houses and fields snake across the landscape in jagged lines.


It chafes particularly because we’re all familiar with the kind of bucolic landscape that Dorfromantik tasks you with making. By placing hexagonal puzzle pieces so that the edges line up –  tree to tree, field to field, home to home – you build out these landscapes, and score points for keeping the jigsaw aligned. Every so often a tile will come with a quest, like turning it into a farm with 50 fields, and completing these gives you more tiles. You can play until you run out.

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or even &quot;possibly, why?&quot;, then you might find Retro Gadgets handy when it launches on PC towards the end of the year.

That’s according to Bologna-based devs Evil Licorice, who count amongst them Kingdom co-creator Marco Bancale. Check out the trailer below, and try not to burn yourself with any soldering irons.

A blog post from the developers shares how they’re reworking the game’s setting of the USG Ishimura, along with bringing protagonist Isaac Clarke into line with Dead Spaces 2 and 3. They’re also finding time to flesh out the story with extra side quests.

I&#x27;d literally just woken up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, only to emotionally destabilise my morning with an eight-minute-long video in which one of, if not the greatest tennis player of all time poured out his heart. Even his great rival Rafael Nadal couldn&#x27;t hold back his tears, which said it all, really.

                              <span>Well this is a mouthful.
I recently worked on a neat hack called puppet-package-check. It
is designed to warn about manually installed packages, to make sure
&quot;everything is in Puppet&quot;. But it turns out it can (probably?)
dramatically increase the bootstrap time of Puppet bootstrap when it
needs to install a large number of packages.
Detecting manual packages
On a cleanly filed workstation, it looks like this:
root@emma:/home/anarcat/bin# ./puppet-package-check -v
listing puppet packages...
listing apt packages...
loading apt cache...
0 unmanaged packages found

A messy workstation will look like this:
root@curie:/home/anarcat/bin# ./puppet-package-check -v
listing puppet packages...
listing apt packages...
loading apt cache...
288 unmanaged packages found

Cory Doctorow wrote an insightful medium article “We Should Not Endure a King” describing the case for anti-trust laws [2]. We need them badly.
Insightful Guardian article about the way reasonable responses to the bad situations people are in are diagnosed as mental health problems [3]. Providing better mental healthcare is good, but the government should also work on poverty etc.
Cory Doctorow wrote an insightful Locus article about some of the issues that have to be dealt with in applying anti-trust legislation to tech companies [4]. We really need this to be done.
Ars Technica has an interesting article about Stable Diffusion, an open source ML system for generating images [5], the results that it can produce are very impressive. One interesting thing is that the license has a set of conditions for usage which precludes exploiting or harming minors or generating false information [6]. This means it will need to go in the non-free section of Debian at best.
Dan Wang wrote an interesting article on optimism as human capital [7] which covers the reasons that people feel inspired to create things.

                              <span>Quick bit of news for you: Nintendo and The Pokemon Company have provided more information on Wiglett, the Pokemon revealed yesterday for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
This newly discovered Pokemon lives in the Paldea region and is known as a Garden Eel Pokemon. It may look like Diglett, but it’s a different species. It is a Water-type and features the abilities Gooey and Rattled.
Boasting an exceptional sense of smell, Wiglett can pick up scents from over 60 feet away. It has a skittish disposition and is constantly cautious of its surroundings. When it notices the scent of other Pokemon, it burrows into the sand to conceal itself.

Stadia players will be refunded all hardware purchases made through the Google Store. This includes the Stadia Controller, Stadia Founder’s Edition, Stadia Premiere Edition, or Play and Watch with Google TV Package.
The refund will also apply to all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store.

                              <span>It’s 2022, an eye-watering 31 years since I first encountered the little blue bastard. I’m in the midst of a noisy trade show, and the latest Sonic the Hedgehog game is telling me how to open a switch gate, in a tutorial level that looks worryingly like Death Stranding – a post-apocalyptic Kojima game about delivering Amazon packages to Geoff Keighley, or something. Is this what 31 years as a sexless mascot does to a mf?
Thirty-one years.
Yet, somehow, Sonic has prevailed. Against the insurmountable odds of multiple decades passing, the console arm of SEGA that he originated as a mascot of disappearing in a puff of bad management, and (perhaps most astoundingly) a general sense that the games have been a bit bobbins since, well, 1998 if you’re being charitable or 1994 if you aren’t.

                              <span>Sony will launch its PlayStation Stars loyalty program in North America on October 5 and in Europe on October 13.
Launching first in Asia today, PlayStation Stars is free to join for those who have a PlayStation Network account.  While you will earn certain benefits for being a PlayStation Plus member, a PlayStation Plus membership is not required to join the program.
The program will be accessible through the PlayStation App on iOS and Android and can be accessed online. Sony has plans to expand the program to console devices in the future.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2 recently wrapped up what ended up being the biggest beta in Call of Duty history, so you can imagine that popularity also came with a lot of feedback from players. Though sentiments are generally positive, a few issues in particular have cropped up repeatedly.
In an effort to address these concerns, developer Infinity Ward highlighted some of the most common ones and discussed what it&#x27;s going to be doing about them for launch.
In a blog post, the studio commented on certain issues, leaving others undiscussed. Sadly, even the ones that got mentioned by name didn&#x27;t receive satisfying answers.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has technically been released yet again, with the Anniversary Edition being made available on the Nintendo Switch eShop, seemingly out of nowhere. 
I’ve played Skyrim an embarrassing amount of times. Despite how many peers and friends insist Morrowind and Oblivion are the better games, it’s Skyrim that continually has me crawling back. No matter how many game-breaking bugs I encounter, or how many times I simply forget to save at a pivotal moment and end up frustrated, I have a never-ending toxic relationship with Tamriel. I’m okay with this.
My last full play through of the title was on the Nintendo Switch (excluding the time I spent hours modding Skyrim in VR to realise that actually, I should probably play Blade &amp; Sorcery instead). I didn’t expect much from Skyrim on the Switch, and honestly thought that I’d probably give up and play it on Xbox again. However, I was wrong. I played the game to completion, and only had to lose my progress twice when bugs occurred; this was a success, if you ask me.

                              <span>Following our preview of Crisis Core&#x27;s impending remaster, Alex and I sat down to chat about its place in the new post-remake Final Fantasy 7 universe, and whether it still holds up as a prequel in that context, over some gorgeous 4K gameplay footage.
There’s no doubt that the burgeoning media franchise that is Final Fantasy 7 has picked up a lot of new fans since the remake launched in 2020, introducing an entire generation of fresh players to a universe that has been steadily expanding since 1997 with multiple prequels and film projects making up the “Compilation of Final Fantasy VII” metaseries.
Crisis Core originally released in 2007, ten years after the original game, and is widely considered to be the best of FF7’s spin-offs, chronicling the life of a key fan-favourite character and re-examining a pivotal moment in the timeline that casts a deep shadow over the rest of the series.

                              <span>If, like me, you wait patiently for the Steam sale to arrive before purchasing anything from your wishlist, then you’re in luck. Valve has now listed its Steam sale dates for autumn, winter, and spring, and we can all prepare ahead of time.
Previously, we had Lunar New Year celebrations on Steam which are now being replaced with a spring sale. Without further ado, here are the dates you can expect your wishlist, and plenty other games, to be much cheaper.
The autumn sale will start on Steam on November 22, running for a week until November 29. As for the winter sale, which is perhaps my favourite for dishing out seasonal gifts to long-distance friends, will run from December 22 to January 5.
