                              <span>Logitech&#x27;s G29 racing wheel and pedals is down to $230 at Amazon, offering a great chance to pick up a highly-regarded budget wheel at a fair price. 
The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There&#x27;s also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that&#x27;s available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

There, you can find a 32GB kit of DDR5-5600 CL36 memory for $150, reduced from its normal price of $180. That&#x27;s more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you&#x27;re getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

                              <span>Man, I was worried this week. I&#x27;ve had a string of possible reports that were all disappointingly tepid. Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I&#x27;m still not sure if he&#x27;s talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

An in-game celebration of all things Bavarian that’s riffing on the actual Oktoberfest, Arktoberfest runs until October 3rd. It’ll bring themed festival foods to the game, along with some staggeringly well-balanced beer steins. Arktoberfest is the first big event to come to Lost Ark in the West that wasn&#x27;t in the original Korean and Russian version of the game.

In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

                              <span>Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a &quot;GeForce Beyond&quot; show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

                              <span>Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a &#x27;sad, middle-aged dad&#x27; look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom&#x27;s UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu&#x27;s been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

While there’s some new monsters to square off against, I feel the most critically important part of the update is the layered weapons system. This gives you the option to unsheathe some truly bizarre weaponry, including something that appears to be a comically huge ear of sweet corn. Witness for yourself by watching the trailer below.

Your adventure unfolds by making decisions using cards which represent allies, resources, and events, which often have weird and surprising consequences. Weirdly, the game it most reminds me of is Townscaper: throw pieces together, uncertain what will happen, then be surprised and delighted what the system produces. Like accidentally making your cowboy confess his love for his horse, leading to a fresh new baby horse card in your hand. Oh no.

                              <span>Capcom have revealed a closed beta weekend for upcoming fighting sequel Street Fighter 6, running from October 7th to 10th. The beta will feature crossplay across Steam and current-gen consoles. How have Capcom chosen to announce this? With a bunch of lads dancing around with boxes on their heads, that’s how. Check out the truly bizarre yet swagger-laden trailer below.

                              <span>I’ve always thought each of the sixteen colossi in Shadow Of The Colossus is kinda cute in their own special way. There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant.

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment head and Battlefield franchise boss Vince Zampella has spoken about the reception - and failure - of the series&#x27; most recent entry, Battlefield 2042, suggesting it &quot;strayed too far from&quot; its roots.


Battlefield 2042 was dogged by technical issues and controversial design decisions when it launched last year, quickly attracting overwhelmingly negative reviews from players on Steam.


Since then, developer DICE has continued to tweak and expand on Battlefield 2042&#x27;s wobbly base, but it&#x27;s often felt like too little, too late - with publisher EA admitting the game&#x27;s sales &quot;did not meet expectations&quot;, saying, &quot;Some of the design choices we made...did not resonate with everyone in our community&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has revealed its upcoming PSVR2 headset for PlayStation 5 won&#x27;t be compatible with games for the original PSVR.


That&#x27;s according to PlayStation&#x27;s SVP of platform experience, Hideaki Nishino, speaking in the latest episode of the Official PlayStation Podcast (jump to the 29:10 mark). &quot;PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2,&quot; he explained in answer to a question from the host, &quot;because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience&quot;. 


Elaborating further, Nishino claimed the new elements of the PVSR2 hardware - inside-out tracking and eye-tracking, 3D audio, a 4K HDR display, and its controller with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback - meant &quot;developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR.&quot;

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 closed beta announcement, Capcom has now revealed the full 18-strong character roster coming to the fighting series&#x27; latest instalment on launch day.


Previously, Capcom had confirmed 11 of the characters set to be playable in Street Fighter 6, offering a mix of familiar faces and brand-new additions. The iconic likes of Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, and Guile were all confirmed to be in, alongside more recent additions Juri and Luke. And as for newcomers, &quot;self-styled Chinatown peacekeeper&quot; Jamie and &quot;devoted student to Bushinryu&quot; Kimberly were both confirmed to be along for the ride.


As of today, though, that earlier 11-strong line-up has seen seven more additions, with Capcom having now announced Street Fighter 6&#x27;s full launch day roster. Series stalwarts Zangief, Cammy, and Dee Jay are all present and correct, and the list of newcomers is complete with Manon, Marisa, Lily, and JP.

                              <span>There&#x27;s good news for PlayStation-owning fans of developer Team Cherry&#x27;s sublime Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.


Hollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it&#x27;ll offer a twist on its predecessor&#x27;s non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.


Given how very excellent the original Hollow Knight was, that&#x27;s still more than enough to warrant excitement, and Switch, Xbox, and PC players have been able to rest easy knowing Silksong would - eventually, at least - be available on their system to play.

                              <span>After nearly eight years in development, an ambitious VR mod for Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter Half-Life 2 finally launches on Steam today as a public beta.


Created by a group of modders going by the name of Source VR Mod Team, Half-Life 2: VR Mod has had a bit of a bumpy journey to release. Eurogamer first reported on the project back in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra in 2013. Some time after, it disappeared into what the team recently called &quot;its own kind of development hell&quot;, almost being abandoned, but eventually re-emerged in 2021.


The wait continued until last month, when Source VR Mod Team announced that, thanks to a &quot;new influx of team members [that] revitalised&quot; development, the Half-Life 2: VR project was poised to release, and that day is now here.

There are two new trailers for us to digest, so let&#x27;s get into it!

A gameplay trailer, posted on the Japanese Like a Dragon YouTube channel, focuses on Ryoma Sakamoto&#x27;s (or Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s historical counterpart) fighting styles (embedded below).

Announced as part of Tokyo Game Show, the developer also shared a new concept trailer (below) for us all to pore over. 


Here, the Genshin Impact team stated: &quot;Let&#x27;s step into this vast magical world of adventure together! The long-term collaboration project between Genshin Impact and ufotable has begun.&quot;

                              <span>We learned this week that brilliant GameCube role-playing game Tales of Symphonia was getting a re-release on modern consoles - but fans have now expressed disappointment at the fact it will run at a locked 30fps. 


The detail, listed on the game&#x27;s new Japanese website, has raised eyebrows since Symphonia on GameCube was presented in largely 60fps (with 30fps only for the world map).


Instead, this new remaster features a blanket 1080p 30fps across all three platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a blockbuster week thanks to Tokyo Game Show 2022 and showcases from the likes of Nintendo and Sony.

With so many announcements, it&#x27;s easy to get lost in what&#x27;s already out and what&#x27;s available when. 

Here&#x27;s a quick reminder of everything new that was announced for Game Pass this week.

                              <span>There&#x27;s prolific, and then there&#x27;s Team Ninja. No sooner had I wrapped up an evening with the demo of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty - a demo that&#x27;s just gone live to all on PlayStation 5 - than the news broke of another in its long line of action games with Rise of the Ronin. And all this before I&#x27;ve even had the chance to finish the team&#x27;s take on Final Fantasy, Strangers of Paradise, or even managed to fully get my head around what exactly Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is. 


There&#x27;s plenty that&#x27;s familiar in Wo Long, though, both from the Nioh games it builds upon - themselves a pair of hard-edged, deeply enjoyable spins on the action RPG template laid out by FromSoft&#x27;s Souls games - and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s broader history with the Three Kingdoms periods. Because, in the simplest terms possible, Wo Long is Nioh transposed to the mythology and legends of third century China. 


It&#x27;s more than that, though, with an all-new approach to combat and an entirely different feel to it all. Nioh was a game of studied composure, and one that rewarded consideration in your attacks. Wo Long, on the other hand, flows like water and invites you to lose yourself in its combat, pulling you through its stages with a momentum quite unlike that which you&#x27;d associate with your typical Soulslike. It&#x27;s not quite a musou - that brand of crowd-clearing action that Koei Tecmo has made a craft of over the past 20 years - but it weaves in some ideas with its morale system that sees you conquering the map to earn more power.  The end result is something that feels surprisingly novel.

                              <span>A mod for Cyberpunk 2077 enables Night City&#x27;s vehicles to take to the skies.


The mod in question comes from Jack Humbert on Nexus Mods (via PC Gamer). Named &#x27;Let there be flight&#x27;, this mod &quot;enables a configurable flight system for all vehicles with custom thruster models, visual &amp; sound effects, and animations.&quot;


This adds something to Cyberpunk 2077 that many had hoped would have been included on the game&#x27;s initial release almost two years ago.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has reiterated that Microsoft has no plans to raise the price of its consoles - after Sony stunned fans last month by hiking the price of PlayStation 5.


Speaking overnight to CNBC, Spencer noted the current economic issues many were facing, and said Xbox didn&#x27;t think it &quot;was the right move for us at this point&quot; to follow suit.


&quot;In a time when our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move for us at this point to be raising prices on our consoles,&quot; Spencer said.

&quot;It&#x27;s time to Build a Zoo,&quot; reads the press release. &quot;Construct and decorate enclosures, buy and breed animals, hire zookeepers and vets... then try your hand at DNA splicing, and stitch together over 500,000 different types of animal. This can only go smoothly...&quot;


Splicing, did you say? Well, yes, yes I did! In Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, players can quite literally mix things up during any given playthrough. On its console release, new players will be able to exhibit a whole myriad of unusual beings. After all, who wouldn&#x27;t want to see a crocoduck if the opportunity presented itself.

                              <span>As the spat intensifies between Sony and Microsoft over the latter&#x27;s impending Activision Blizzard buyout, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has given his thoughts on the matter to US TV.


Spencer appeared on CNBC overnight and was questioned over Sony&#x27;s recent comments on the deal - including pushback from PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who previously branded Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances around the future of Call of Duty as &quot;inadequate&quot;. 


When asked whether Microsoft was prepared to go further than its recently-stated pledge - to keep COD on PlayStation for several more years - and perhaps promise it would remain on PlayStation in perpetuity, Spencer said his expectation was that Xbox would &quot;continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation and other places&quot;.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 has been doing better on Steam recently, with a steady increase in player count now making it one of the most played single-player games on the platform. 

It feels a bit wild to be making this statement nearly two years after the game came out.

According to SteamDB, yesterday the number concurrent players in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam peaked at 37,000, beating out Elden Ring on 31,000 and mostly topped by titles with a huge multiplayer base such as Grand Theft Auto 5 and Destiny 2.

Speaking to IGN about the upcoming game, de Fondaumiere shared that, while with each new title the studio does &quot;try to innovate&quot; and &quot;explore new ground&quot;, Quantic Dream will always retain various aspects of their games in future releases.


&quot;With Star Wars Eclipse we&#x27;re certainly going to keep the fundamental elements of a Quantic Dream game,&quot; he explained.

And they are: Earthworm Jim, Alisia Dragoon, and The Story of Thor (known as Beyond Oasis in the US).


Earthworm Jim is the most well known of these, a 90s character platformer about a humanoid worm in a space suit (look, it was the &#x27;90s...), but don&#x27;t sleep on those other two.

French publisher Microids announced the imminent release of Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission, officially licensed by Taito and due out on consoles this autumn. It&#x27;s also coming to VR in 2023.


All we have on this new game for now is a handful of screenshots, below, which show a new cartooney art style compared to the cult classic late-&#x27;80s arcade shooter. I&#x27;m sure this one&#x27;s going to prove divisive.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
Apparently, I&#x27;m drawn to doing mundane things. Perhaps I&#x27;m inherently boring. I just can&#x27;t get enough of tidying up, though, or folding someone&#x27;s clothes, or washing them. Or cleaning the toilet, and I never thought I&#x27;d write that. And I know that isn&#x27;t really the point of Arcade Paradise - the point is growing an arcade out the back - but it&#x27;s the mundane half of the game in the laundrette that really balances me, and the game, out. Beautiful monotony - something to gently latch a restless mind onto and occupy my hands with.

                              <span>Outer Wilds, the stellar time loop adventure - and Eurogamer Game of the Year 2019 - from developer Mobius Digital, has just received a next-gen upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Outer Wilds, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, casts players as tentative space explorers, slinging them into a miniature solar system of bizarre planets, absolutely stuffed with secrets. There&#x27;s little direction, only a breadcrumb trail of clues hinting at a much larger mystery, and it all gradually opens out into glorious puzzle box, as ingenious as it is hauntig. And that&#x27;s even before you start to grapple with the ramifications of the solar system resetting itself every 20 minutes.


It&#x27;s great, then, but while Outer Wilds has technically been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S before now via backward compatibility, &quot;playing...was not recommended because players could run into sections that weren’t optimised for the next-gen consoles, and encounter other backwards compatibility issues such as controller input lag&quot; - as Mobius explains in a new post.

                              <span>PC graphics card manufacturer EVGA has announced that it will terminate making all GPU hardware at the end of this current hardware generation, following a large-scale falling out with GPU tech titan Nvidia. 


In a move that is likely to have significant repercussions across the PC gaming hardware industry, EVGA isn’t just dropping Nvidia - it also has no plans to move into creating GPUs with either AMD or Intel, Nvidia’s two key rivals. Instead, the company, which is well-known for making high-quality cards at reasonable prices, will quit the GPU business entirely.


The news was delivered today by a small number of hardware specialist media in various detailed reports, the best of which can be found over at the brilliant GamersNexus on YouTube (and embedded below). These outlets were directly briefed by EVGA, which confirmed that despite building prototype and test cards based on Nvidia’s upcoming 40-series GPUs, it wouldn’t be proceeding with those products - or any further Nvidia products.

                              <span>Project L — the 2 vs 2 fighting game lined up as industry giant Riot Games&#x27; next big release — is still a ways out. There’s no release date yet, only a handful of characters, and via our last major update we know the team have only just locked in the foundational gameplay and have moved onto full-on feature and character creation. The reality of people jumping on stage to play Project L for money is still a distant vision. However, does this mean Riot Games haven’t been setting up the groundwork? No way mate - I certainly didn’t think so.
As such, since I was in Sweden for the LEC Summer Finals where the best European teams were battling it out in top-of-class League of Legends, I thought it best to do some digging. Sitting across from me in a curtained interview room was senior director of esports for the EU Alberto Guerrero, who was the perfect person to question about what their plans were for Riot&#x27;s yet-to-be-release fighting game, what they had done in this primordial pre-release stage, and what special stuff they had in mind for the Fighting game community (FGC).
But why should anyone care? Sure Riot Games is working on its fighting game right now, but why does its future esports vision actually matter to those who play fighting games right now? Well, it doesn&#x27;t take a fortune teller to predict that Project L will send shockwaves across the genre. It&#x27;s free to play, which means it&#x27;ll have a strong initial base, and with pre-existing Riot Games fans — and Riot Games money — behind it, how it stands on the big stage will likely influence or outright alter how other developers and publishers approach their own titles.

Odyssey Interactive has just shown off its premier title, with former staff from a range of industry giants including Riot Games among senior staff. A 3v3 competitive sports x fighting game, you can apply to enter the closed beta right now.
While only playable on the PC right now, news of future mobile and console versions are apparently on the way. So if you like the look of the trailer below, but the sight of a keyboard deeply frightens you, hopefully the wait shouldn’t be that bad.
The gameplay is all about two teams of three smashing eachother off the arena in order to clear the path for a shot on goal. It’s like a sci-fi version of what you wish football really was when you were a teen, where you could just smash into the lad who actually spent his free time doing exercise and footy practice.

A lot of us grouse and gripe about it, but as a platform, it’s become hugely important to gaming and hardcore gamers. I’d even go so far as to say that it’s indispensable.
Fans use it to celebrate and complain. Developers and media form little Twitter bubbles where they socialize and hang out. During covid lockdowns, Twitter became a primary networking and communication tool, and, more importantly, a way to catch up with people for vital sanity-checks. The gaming news cycle is now practically built around Twitter; if you want the news first, that’s where you’ll go. If we’re lucky, the hot tweet will point you to the full write-up on VG247. Twitter has changed how the gaming industry functions. 
And Twitter knows it, too. The company believes that 71% of Twitter users play games, and 47% of its user base see watching people play games on platforms like Twitch as a form of entertainment. Gaming is massive on the platform, with the first half of 2022 seeing 1.5 billion Tweets on gaming topics – a new record, mapping to about 96 hot takes a second. That’s a whole lot of wrong opinions and console warring. As a result, it’s not a surprise to hear where Twitter sees itself.

                              <span>As a vital piece of the Final Fantasy 7 lore and universe, it always seemed inevitable that Square Enix would somehow re-release Crisis Core, the FF7 prequel that first released for PSP in 2007. The release, which FF7 steward Tetsuya Nomura says promoted internal discussion about whether it’d qualify as a remake or a remaster, does sort of defy categorization – but now I’ve played it for myself, I’m going to try anyway.

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion is a remaster. It’s perhaps not quite ‘more than a remaster’, as Square Enix has suggested, but it’s a bloody impressive run at tidying up and improving a game that was on a handheld console that, ultimately, was less powerful than the PS2. 

In stills, Crisis Core definitely does look like more than a remaster, though. What you have here is low-key PS4 quality character models that wouldn’t look out of place in FF7 Remake proper dropped into the PSP game. In many cases, it seems like Square Enix has made clever use of the FF7 Remake asset – directly using some models and textures from that game, just back-porting them to this 2007 title. In stills, and even sometimes in motion in combat, it looks pretty damn impeccable.

                              <span>As Remy of Ratatouille once said, &quot;if you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff.&quot; Disney Dreamlight Valley is surprisingly good stuff, and I&#x27;m going to keep reaching for more and more plates until someone begs that I put it down.
I&#x27;m likely not alone in regards to this sentiment, either, with Disney Dreamlight Valley having raked in over 1 million players since launching ten days ago into early access. The news was shared directly via the game&#x27;s Twitter account, reading &quot;We&#x27;re overjoyed to see you discover what it means to #LiveMagically. Thank you for your excitement, feedback and sharing the game with your friends. This is just the beginning!&quot;
Before anyone accuses me of being a Disney adult who&#x27;d obviously be all over this game, I&#x27;ve never been massively into Disney whatsoever. Sure, I&#x27;ve got an affinity towards borderline-cult classics such as Ratatouille, but I frankly couldn&#x27;t care less about things like Frozen and Tangled.

                              <span>We’ve not even known about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty –  the next game from the creators of Nioh – for that long. It was announced back at Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Games Showcase in June, and immediately caught the eye of everyone that’s got even a passing love for all things hardcore action-RPG.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is the new action title from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo (no, not Rise of the Ronin – we’re not going to see that for another few years yet), and in a series of trailers, it demonstrated how it immediately intends to separate itself from the developer’s previous Nioh games. 
There’s a jump button! There are no stances! You cannot ki pulse! It’s much quicker! It’s set in China instead of Japan! But it’s hard to divine any of what this actually means for the game, really, from trailers – no matter how flashy and well put-together they are. In a hands-on with the game’s first demo, though, I’ve been able to try it all out for myself… and let me tell you, the difference is as vast and important as FromSoftware’s was in the jump from Dark Souls to Bloodborne.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a banner week for Team Ninja: as well as debuting the stunning Rise of the Ronin at Sony&#x27;s State of Play showcase earlier this week, the Japanese developer has also launched a demo for its more immidiate upcoming game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.
We already knew that the new game, set in the Three Kingdoms-era of China&#x27;s dynastic history, was set to receive a demo &quot;in the near future&quot;, but thanks to the Tokyo Game Show, we can all enjoy it right now!
You need to be quick, though: the test isn&#x27;t sticking around for long (likley because you need to be online at all times to enjoy it). Don&#x27;t worry if you&#x27;ve not got an active Xbox Live or PS+ membership, though; the multiplayer option in this demo does not require a paid membership to the online services of each platform, per the publisher.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not common knowledge, but international mega star, Beyoncé, is a huge Assassin&#x27;s Creed fan. I&#x27;m quite surprised more hasn&#x27;t been made about this, given her influence, but now you know. Her 2006 stratospheric chart topper, Irreplaceable, was at one point all about Assassin&#x27;s Creed - a game she played an early build of and loved so much she simply had to pen a song about it, even before it hit stores.
The song, which went on to the biggest tune of 2007 in the US, originally talked about how the star loved Assassin&#x27;s Creed so much that it could never be replaced by another game. In a strange turn of events, however, Beyoncé has a phobia of flags, so was quite shocked to see so many in the game when she played it just prior to the release of Irreplaceable. This shocking twist resulted in the song hastily being rewritten to focus on a relationship, and the original song never saw the light of day.
Bizarrely, she also has an irrational dislike of first-party PlayStation exclusives.

                              <span>With the release of Hello Neighbor 2 only a couple of months away, Eerie Guest Studios has created a short, standalone playable experience that’ll help players prepare for the full open-world stealth horror title when it launches on December 6.
The demo itself takes you back to where it all began, the Peterson house, for an early investigation as to what Hello Neighbor 2 could entail. Releasing on September 20, the demo is a completely standalone experience that will not spoil the full game, but simply prepare you for it.
It’s up to you to get to the bottom of what Mr. Peterson is hiding in Hello Neighbor 2, and on a much wider scope. In the open world of Raven Brooks, there is an entire towns worth of twisted mysteries to unravel. And with children continually going missing, you’re certain that Mr. Peterson has something to do with it.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is shaping up like it might be one of the greatest ever apologies in gaming history – and the world of video games is one where a lot of developers have had to make embarrassing admissions that their previous project was, y’know, a bit crap. I’ve always been a strong supporter of Street Fighter 5, and the fact that it got significantly better over time... but lord knows, the difference between SF5 and SF6 is night and day.

I’ve already played Street Fighter 6, of course. But this new sit-down, with a Tokyo Game Show build of the game, is a slightly updated and different build to the one I spent an hour or so with before. Here’s what’s new this time around:

I want to start out with what might seem like the least consequential piece of this updated build – the new commentators. And, well… I’m impressed? Commentary in video games is, of course, always a bit of a mixed bag. It repeats itself, it becomes stale, and it is often the subject of memes (especially in traditional sports games). But Street Fighter 6 has a canny solution to these ills – and it just might work.

It represents a massive course-correction from the controversial mis-steps of SFV, but it hasn’t jettisoned everything from the previous game: everything salvageable has been iterated and improved upon, resulting in a blend of SF4, SF5, and a breadth of new ideas.
Alex’s hands-on session with the Tokyo Game Show build focused on four newly revealed characters: the powerful but unwieldy Guile, for starters. Juri, whose SF6 incarnation is a refinement on her SF5 version but with some of her fan-favourite moveset brought in from SF4. Kimberly, an entirely new character for SF6 but with strong links to the wider Capcom lore.
And, lastly, Ken Masters; resplendent here in his “she’s turned the weans against us” era garb. Despite the divorcee-chic, though, it’s still the same old Ken: if he was your main in 1991, he’ll feel like being right back home again. Assuming she didn’t get the house.

                              <span>Activision and Infinity Ward showed off the multiplayer portion of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 today ahead of the open beta, which kicks off tomorrow.
One multiplayer feature the developers showed off was swimming and Aquatic Combat. Instead of dying when hitting the water like in previous games,  action now occurs above, on, and in water. Various elements will be present such as currents and waves, and the water can be clean, murky, polluted, or have debris. 
In the open beta, maps with water will showcase these enhancements, and you can use water as a stealth or escape mechanism. You can even change your stance or sprint and look down to plunge underwater. If you fire underwater using sidearms and certain equipment, your weapon’s projectile will be affected by the increased density, so you may need to change your aim. You will also need to pay special attention to Tactical items, and you may need to try all-new strategies when attacking boats, enemies below the water’s surface, or when you’re avoiding or deploying an explosive.

Anyway, the vampy reverse bullet hell will reveal the launch date for 1.0 on September 29th. In the meantime, today brought the release of minor patch 0.11.3, which includes a new weapon, a new secret character, and the final Arcana.

                              <span>The Xbox app now offers estimates for how long a Game Pass game might take you to beat, to help guide your decisions on what to play next. Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games&#x27; pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it&#x27;s down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you&#x27;ll have to move fast to pick this one up...

                              <span>This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I&#x27;m able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren&#x27;t eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don&#x27;t actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

                              <span>It’s been just about a year since Chapter 2 of Deltarune was released for free, but we won’t be seeing any more from the game this year. That’s the message from dev Toby Fox, who’s posted an update on how Deltarune’s coming along. Fox’s message to those eagerly awaiting more from the game was published to mark the seventh anniversary of his indie RPG smash Undertale. It shares some new screens, GIFs, a video and even some tunes.

                              <span>Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn&#x27;t been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we&#x27;ve now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn&#x27;t ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn&#x27;t a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you&#x27;ll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won&#x27;t succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

The addition to the Green Team’s subscription service was announced during this morning’s ID@Xbox livestream at Tokyo Game Show. All the game’s updates from the past year will be present, plus a new update called Goldenloop. That adds a new weapon, ability, enemy types and an extended ending. Oh, and there’s crossplay across all platforms and stores too. Watch the new trailer below.

Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

                              <span>Capcom has shared more details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s next free Title Update, which will introduce the likes of the Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos when it comes to Switch and PC on 29th September.


When Capcom previously discussed Title Update 2 at the end of last month, it confirmed that monster variant Flaming Espinas would be one ofits new additions. It&#x27;s now announced two additional variants for the release - the aforementioned Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos - both appering in its latest update trailer.


There&#x27;s not much information about the Violet Mizutsune just yet, but the Risen Chameleos is described as an Elder Dragon that has &quot;overcome the affliction by achieving symbiosis with the Qurio, gaining great strength and new abilities&quot;. As such, it &quot;poses an even greater danger than when they were still under the influence of the affliction&quot; - so tread carefully.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking multi-character survival horror from acclaimed developer Santa Ragione - finally has a release date, and will be inviting PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players into its ever-shifting labyrinth on 27th October.


We&#x27;re big fans of Santa Ragione&#x27;s previous work, which includes MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, around these parts, and Saturnalia sounds just as intriguing. It&#x27;s a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.


The goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>Following tonight&#x27;s big Call of Duty blowout we finally have a release date for the much-anticipated Warzone 2.0 - plus we&#x27;ve plenty more details on what to expect. 


Warzone 2.0 is set to launch on 16th November, some two weeks after the launch of Modern Warfare 2 on 28th October. The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It&#x27;ll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone&#x27;s take on Escape from Tarkov. 


Like other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.

                              <span>Lego Bricktales, the beautiful diorama-based puzzler from developer ClockStone, finally has a release date and will be coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 12th October.


Announced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


The ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales&#x27; brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.

                              <span>Norco, the acclaimed Southern gothic adventure from developer Geography of Robots, will be making the jump from PC to PlayStation and Xbox next month, arriving on 20th October.


Norco unfolds in the &quot;sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps&quot; of a surreal, future South Louisiana, where players embark on a quest to find their brother, Blake - missing after the death of their mother.


What follows is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure, but one that aims in all sorts of directions, with Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell somewhat futilely summing it up as a &quot;text-adventure, turn-based party battler, boat-navigating... poem... puzzler?&quot; in his review.

Series veterans Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim and E. Honda were all confirmed as returning characters to the roster. Footage of the Battle Hub showed a game centre full of arcade cabinets for players to compete against one another.

                              <span>We&#x27;re back again this week for another Eurogamer Newscast, focusing on the recent Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play, plus the week&#x27;s big news on the Yakuza franchise and what&#x27;s next from Xbox Game Pass. It&#x27;s been a busy week - full of Zelda, Pikmin, God of War and Yakuza 8 - but some corners of the internet are disappointed.


True, we didn&#x27;t see some of the things we had expected might materialise. This week was not when we saw Wind Waker on Switch, Silent Hill on PlayStation, or got some kind of assurance Nintendo remembered what Metroid even was. But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t plenty to look forward to.

Join Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan for our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom theories, thoughts on new Switch hardware, and our expert opinion on where to start with Yakuza.

                              <span>At the conclusion of Resident Evil Village, it was teased that Ethan Winters&#x27; now teenage daughter could wield some impressive powers. What exactly these powers were was never disclosed, with Rose revealing that &quot;even Chris&quot; didn&#x27;t know the full extent of what she could do thanks to her brush with the megamycete. 


However, a new trailer for Village&#x27;s The Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC has shown off more from its new story, Shadows of Rose, including what these powers are.


Shared as part of Capcom&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show presentation, this trailer reveals that Rose is actually able to freeze her enemies. So, very name appropriate.

                              <span>343 Industries has announced that it will not be adding purchasable Spartan Points into Halo: The Master Chief Collection. 

Back in June, 343 discussed the idea of introducing Spartan Points, a premium currency to unlock items within the game.


The idea was that given there are over 1000 customisation items in MCC which were added over the years, it could be overwhelming for new players or those who only hop into the game occasionally.

                              <span>Capcom has announced a last-gen PlayStation 4 version of its upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake - but will still skip the Xbox One. 


The long-rumoured Resi 4 remake was finally unveiled back in June, and was initially announced for just PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Today, during a Tokyo Games Show livestream, Capcom said it had been working on securing a last-gen version of the game as well - and it had done so, but only for PS4.

                              <span>I had an interview with the team behind Plasma. Sadly, I listened back to the transcript and it&#x27;s fifteen minutes of me laughing with delight, while heavy aircraft are clearly going through maneuvers overhead. No matter. Plasma is dizzyingly complex, but very easy to explain. It&#x27;s an engineering sandbox game. You make stuff in a 3D world using pre-made parts and simplified code, and then you can share it with other people.


What kind of stuff? The team isn&#x27;t sure - as in, they aren&#x27;t sure where the boundaries are. People are going to make dioramas and games and working Babbage engines no doubt. Over the course of my interview I saw a working Pong machine, with a screen to play the game on and a decent run at the classic Pong cabinet. I saw a bunny robot with an emoji face and massive feet that kept falling over. I saw an articulated hand the size of a house that moved between waving and giving me a brisk thumbs-up. When doesn&#x27;t that add something to your day? Oh yes, and a horrible robot spider that had basic player-seeking capabilities. 


All of this in a 3D world with gentle hills, blue skies and green grass. But how does it work? To answer this I was shown a little remote control car that could be steered with a joypad. And then the developers made a second car, shaping basic blocks, putting on an engine and wheels and a device for programming steering, and then disappearing into a sort of drag-and-drop code space in which you can cobble together inputs and outputs, and tweak endlessly if that&#x27;s your thing.

                              <span>The news of the cancellation of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign co-op split-screen option has been frustrating - not least because I was looking forward to playing it with my son, just as I have with all prior Halo titles supporting the feature. The fact that 343 Industries isn&#x27;t supporting it is all the more confusing because right now at least, it&#x27;s possible to glitch your way into split-screen campaign co-op for up to four players. It&#x27;s true that the feature is not without its bugs, but in my experience, these are relatively minor and it&#x27;s possible to play through the entire campaign in split-screen mode. Adding to the sense of disappointment is how close 343 has got to finalising this feature - and it plays brilliantly.


To fully understand the story, we need to go back to 2017 when then-343 Industries head Bonnie Ross addressed the lack of split-screen campaign co-op in Halo 5, making this comment during the 2017 DICE summit: &quot;When we didn&#x27;t put split-screen in with Halo 5, I think it&#x27;s incredibly painful for the community - and for us. It erodes trust with the community, as the community is part of our world building... I would say for any FPS going forward, we will always have split-screen.&quot;


The situation changed a couple of weeks ago when 343&#x27;s head of creative, Joseph Staten announced the cancellation of the feature, suggesting that - to put it bluntly - finite resources were better deployed elsewhere: &quot;We had to make the difficult decision not to ship campaign split-screen co-op and take the resources we would use on that and go after this list and all these other things.&quot;

                              <span>A new update for the Xbox app on PC has added official integration of website HowLongToBeat.

If you haven&#x27;t used it before, HowLongToBeat is a community run website where people can log how long it took them to beat a certain game. The times are then averaged to provide a rough estimate of the game&#x27;s expected length.

It&#x27;s by no means sound scientifically, but it&#x27;s a nifty way of ballparking how much time you might need to finish a game&#x27;s story before you commit to playing (or buying) it.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has shared new details on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s Gunsmith, dubbed &quot;Gunsmith 2.0.&quot; 


Gunsmith was first introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) as a replacement of the attachment system used in preceding titles, and it&#x27;s been used in every game since. 


The system allows players to customise their weapons in greater detail, with multiple attachments, optics and of course, skins.

On its release, players will receive new content including a fishing mini game and an angler mask. There will also be the chance to add various fish and insects to your Vivarium. 


Meanwhile, developer Shedworks has said, thanks to the PS5&#x27;s DualSense controller, riding over the game&#x27;s sand dunes will be &quot;as immersive as ever&quot; with this release.

                              <span>Last night I got through two whole districts with almost no health, and no prospects. An early boss had whittled me down to almost nothing, so I lurched into the eternal night thinking - four health? This won&#x27;t last long. For comparison, I start with 300 health, and that&#x27;s rarely enough. But something happened. The City surprised me. I had a sort of unlikely cyberpunk cup run. Two whole districts on four health. I&#x27;m still thinking about it.
City Wars: Tokyo Reign is the kind of game that surprises me. It surprises me constantly, with great roguelite runs like last night&#x27;s, in which I almost gave up but ended up travelling further than I could have imagined. It surprises me as I see a new wrinkle in its endless unspooling strategies, as I find a new synergy in its cards. It surprised me at the start by filling me with raw enthusiasm for a collectible card game that was also a roguelite - hardly a genre mash-up in short supply. It surprised me that I could take its initially daunting rules and make them my own. City Wars makes CCGs fresh again - it has for me, anyway. I really hope you&#x27;ll play it too.
So let&#x27;s get the roguelite stuff out of the way. It&#x27;s a cyberpunk city filled with alleyways and midnight horrors. You choose a class and then get a randomised loadout of cards from your growing collection, a gun that works as a stats modifier, and a charm that gives you a perk of some kind.

The beta, which is set to go live tomorrow evening, is available to preload now for those who have pre-ordered the game. 


The most notable finding has been the option to adjust the &quot;3rd Person Field of View,&quot; which implies that the game will feature a third-person game mode, as well as an FOV slider on console.

Indeed, a Switch port of anything Yakuza is unlikely to happen, according to Ryu Ga Gotoku Sydido head Masayoshi Yokoyama.

Yokoyama made the statement in an interview with GameSpot yesterday and explained why the studio was reluctant to put Yakuza on Switch.

PowerWash Simulator is a game about cleaning things - cars, helicopters, bungalows - that quickly becomes a compulsion. You complete jobs to upgrade your powerwash machine, then take on progressively bigger challenges. 


Pretty soon you&#x27;re hosing down whole skate parks, fairground rides, and a particularly grubby set of public toilets.

The creator has recently set up a website, presumably for a new game, which features nothing more than a shadowy visage with the words &quot;Who Am I?&quot; written across the image.


Clicking on this image then gives you the option to share said picture across various social media feeds, something that Geoff Keighly has done. As such, the internet now expects whatever this new project of Kojima&#x27;s is to be fully unveiled at The Game Awards this December.

                              <span>The last day of Overwatch 1 will be 2nd October, Blizzard told me during an Overwatch 2 roundtable interview last night. (Note: this is from a Pacific Time point of view. With time differences, it could be 3rd October elsewhere in the world.) Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.
&quot;So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we&#x27;re going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers,&quot; commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. &quot;So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it&#x27;s a 27-hour downtime that we&#x27;re planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. 
&quot;We&#x27;ll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There&#x27;s also a couple of things that we&#x27;ll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We&#x27;ll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.

                              <span>Blizzard has explained in detail how the Overwatch 2 battle pass and associated monetisation will work. The information comes from a briefing document and roundtable group interview I attended last night.
There are no loot boxes in Overwatch 2, in case you didn&#x27;t know. In their place are a battle pass and in-game store, where you&#x27;ll directly buy what you want, using a new currency called Overwatch Coins.
The Overwatch 2 battle pass has two tiers, free and paid, and you will be able to unlock all new Overwatch 2 heroes on that free track. New heroes will be unlockable at tier 55, of around 80 total tiers.

                              <span>Deathloop is officially launching on Xbox and Game Pass next Tuesday.


The first-person single-player shooter, developed by Arkane Lyon, first released this time last year as a PlayStation 5 exclusive (as well as on PC).


The exclusivity raised eyebrows since the game&#x27;s publisher, Bethesda Softworks, was acquired by Microsoft earlier that year.

The reveal came during an unusually packed Tokyo Game Show livestream from Xbox, which also included Game Pass confirmations of the Ni No Kuni series, and an Xbox release date for Deathloop.


Odyssey is the Assassin&#x27;s Creed game set in Ancient Greece, and its deepest dive into the RPG genre. It&#x27;s a warm, enjoyable and expansive experience - and one of the highlights of the whole series.

                              <span>Accessibility in video games has been a topic of growing popularity over the past few years. With both indie developers and mainstream companies bringing new standards of accessibility to the forefront of the gaming industry, there is steady change towards a more inclusive environment for all kinds of players. However, one group that has often been neglected is the blind and visually impaired gaming community. 


Creating games that are accessible to blind players often requires developers to work their way from the ground up, as with The Last of Us Part 2, or build upon what they have already created, in the way that Sea of Thieves handled its accessibility options. 



Sometimes, however, players take matters into their own hands. This is the story of Hearthstone Access, the community around it and how it was brought into existence by the work of just one individual, known only as GuideDev.

                              <span>Another hero has been announced for Overwatch 2 and Blizzard has provided more information on the game&#x27;s Season One Battle Pass.
The new hero, Kiriko, will arrive alongside the game at release. As the newest Support hero, the character can teleport through walls to protect teammates using a healing ofuda. Kiriko can also dash towards enemies to take them out with a kunai.
When it comes to the Season One Battle Pass, Blizzard said it will be &quot;delivering more in one drop&quot; than it has delivered since the original game relesed in 2016. This includes three new heroes, which will all be available immediately to returning Overwatch players who log in during Season One or Season Two.

The video also delved into the mind of the Megamycete, providing a fresh look at Shadows of Rose.

                              <span>League of Legends is an esports mountain, at this point. Over the years since Western professional gaming&#x27;s primordial days, it has broken through and risen through tectonic shifts in the global scene, eventually towering over the majority of its competitors both within its genre – and without. It has even reached the lofty heights required for your mum or dad to have heard about it.There&#x27;s a good chance that if you have a sister, she&#x27;s dated a mid-laner, god help her. Walking around town with a Fnatic or Evil Geniuses t-shirt can, in certain places, elicit a similar reaction that a football (real or American) jersey can. If I see a zoomer in an NA team&#x27;s merch, I&#x27;m likely to laugh at them. If I see someone in old-school Shalke attire, I&#x27;m liable to french kiss them.
But, those plates buried beneath this world of competitive video games keep grinding, resulting in Riot Games spreading its ever growing influence to new pastures that its crown-title simply cannot reach. Valorant has erupted in popularity since its release, with fans and players of its one most notable competitor (CS:GO) jumping ship and leaving only the loyal behind. Wild Rift, the League of Legends mobile game, appears to be building to similar heights, while  Legends of Runeterra is cutting out its own audience among hardcore card duelists. This once lone, daunting mountain has found itself a range of familial peaks.
This is, obviously, great for Riot and its base – but with titles like Project L and the distant Riot MMO on the way, what is the role of League of Legends in this modern landscape? Is it still as important, as paramount to the success of Riot esports? Is it as shiny as it used to be, surrounded by fresher, growing games?

                              <span>It’s been some time since the launch of World of Warcraft Classic’s Wrath of the Lich King pre-patch, an update which saw many of the popular servers, including fresh servers meant to give new and old players a totally green experience, suffering from some serious queue times that made actually jumping in and playing the game incredibly difficult. Now, Blizzard has put out a statement, but the consequences of their actions (or inaction) are starting to be felt.
This statement, released on the Blizzard forums around the time when queues were really horrendous, covers the issue and provides some context for the problem. In terms of solutions, Blizzard halted character creation and transferring to badly-affected mega servers, and locked them down “indefinitely”. This essentially stopped an increased influx of players making the queues worse, which when combined with free transfers off realms has appeared to curb the problem somewhat. 
However, even now, certain mega servers still retain large queues, especially once school and work hours come to a close and players return home for some dungeon grinding, or farming honor in continuous Alterac Valley runs. In the aforementioned post, it’s stated that “we need more folks to move”, but that’s unlikely to happen with certain crowds of Classic WoW players — especially on fresh servers.

                              <span>A hot new trailer for Street Fighter 6 was just dropped during Capcom’s Tokyo Game Show live stream, giving us a look at several returning world warriors, the battle hub, character creation in the single player mode, and the return of good ol’ fashioned car vandalism.
You can watch the trailer embedded below, which goes through each of the significant reveals in detail. As far as an update on Capcom’s next big fighter goes, this is a massive drop. However, with Ken looking a bit more grizzled rather than depressed, it does put the homeless Ken theories on a knives’ edge.
Let&#x27;s start with the characters. Blanka, Honda, Dhalsim and Ken were all revealed briefly in the trailer, with a quick montage of some of their special moves, supers, and presence in the story mode hastily presented to us in Street Fighter 6’s flashy hip-hop inspired style. It’s hard to tell, but a mix of recognisable moves as well as a few new ones can be seen, which is obviously good news for series veterans.

                              <span>Microsoft has added additional titles to Xbox Game Pass today, including Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered, Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony Anniversary Edition, Metal: Hellsinger, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey, and Fuga: Melodies of Steel. 
For those who have never played the lovely Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, the remastered version features enhanced graphics and performance for Xbox Consoles and PC. You owe it to yourself to give the game a try, especially if you are a Game Pass subscriber.
On October 13, Dyson Sphere Program will arrive on PC Game Pass, and the southern gothic point and click narrative adventure game Norco is coming soon to Xbox Game Pass (as well as PC, PS4, and PS5).

                              <span>The announcement that a remastered version of GoldenEye 007 is heading to Xbox was met with cheers – rightly, given it’s one of the best games of all time. Then the cheers gave way to confusion, and disappointment, as it was confirmed that the version of the game releasing on Xbox consoles won’t have online multiplayer – only the classic split-screen. 
In a weird twist, the Nintendo Switch version will have online play – but that release is basically an emulated version of the N64 release rather than a true remaster. It’s all a bit of a mess, and a bit of a disappointment. GoldenEye’s multiplayer is undoubtedly its most famous feature, and while it absolutely will forever be at its best when you’re crowded around a single screen – I also feel like online is a bit of a must in the year of our lord 2022. 

If you want to play GoldenEye multiplayer on Xbox, however, this is an option – and it’s been available since 2010.

The news shouldn’t come as a surprise considering a pre-order ad for the game recently popped up on Xbox consoles through the store page.
The Xbox version comes with all updates released for the game since its release. The updates include photomode, additional accessibility options, cross-play matchmaking, and a multitude of quality-of-life fixes

                              <span>A short while ago, I played Kirby’s Dream Buffet. Following the announcement of the game, I was completely ecstatic. You’re telling me they’re putting my favourite pink puff ball into what, essentially, looks like a tasty version of Fall Guys? And it’s going to be co-op? And it’s on the Switch!?
I was ready to make Kirby’s Dream Buffet one of my games of choice at gatherings, placing it on the same pedestal as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. However, when I actually got my hands on the game, I was left disappointed.
The co-op features that I anticipated were missing. Kirby’s Dream Land felt limited, only allowing for two-player local co-op. Online, I could play with three more friends, but they would then need to buy the game – as well as have their own Switch device to hand. I had my qualms with the game outside of this, which landed a 2/5 in my review, but it was the lack of four-player local co-op that, to me, made the entire premise of the game feel a little redundant.

                              <span>Just a few hours before the big Call of Duty: Next event, pre-registrations for Warzone Mobile have officially gone live in some parts of the world. As it stands, this is only limited to the Android version of the game.
While those looking to play Warzone Mobile on iOS currently have no way to pre-register, it&#x27;s likely that they will open up today during or following the show.
Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile was only recently announced, but eager players saw that Android pre-registrations have opened on the Google Play Store. Clicking the button simply means you can pre-install it once it goes live, which is helpful in cases where the game is rolling out gradually.

                              <span>Guilty Gear: Strive and Blazblue Cross Tag Battle have both been announced for Xbox Game Pass, coming to PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S Spring 2023. This means that two of the best anime fighters out right now are both available for those with a Game Pass sub, easily accessible for those who want to learn some combos.
While both aren&#x27;t particularly new games, with Strive being around a year old and Cross Tag Battle having been hanging around for roughly 3 years now, they both have existing online communities that are bound to get a healthy injection of new fresh players thanks to both opening up to the Game Pass crowd.
Recently this year, both games were present at Evo 2022. Guilty Gear Stive had a second season of DLC characters announced alongside Bridget, a returning character from the series&#x27; past who was set live only days following their showing at the tournament. Unfortunately, Cross Tag Battle didn&#x27;t get any significant announcements along the same line.

The format of today&#x27;s showcase will be similar to the Modern Warfare 2019 reveal event. Following the developer-lead presentations, over 150 streamers and content creators will be jumping in to play the beta ahead of its launch on Friday.
You&#x27;ll be able to go directly to their channels to watch each of their perspectives, or keep it to the main stream, which will be jumping between the different perspectives and offering commentary on the action as it plays out.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a rather hectic week of streams and reveals, with the Nintendo Direct and Sony&#x27;s State of Play being streamed on the same day. Now, it&#x27;s time for the Tokyo Game Show with even more exciting announcements, and already, it looks like 2023 is shaping up to be a good year for games.
As a part of the Tokyo Game Show, which runs from September 15 to September 19, Xbox will have its own livestream. There&#x27;s already been a lot to hear from Microsoft this past year, having hosted its own rather lively Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase in June this year. We got a long, hard look at Starfield and its thousands of planets, plus a further look at exciting titles like Redfall, Forza Motorsport, and Minecraft Legends.
The show goes on, though, and we can anticipate even more news from Xbox today!

                              <span>Ahead of today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next multiplayer showcase event, Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward finally unveiled one of the biggest new additions in the upcoming shooter: Gunsmith 2.0. The Gunsmith system, introduced in the 2019 Modern Warfare, was one of its defining features.
It allowed players to unlock an unprecedented number of attachments and experiment with weapon modifications to a level only seen in milsim shooters. That system has been revamped for Modern Warfare 2, and the developer explained what its goals are in a new video.
There are two key pillars to Gunsmith 2.0, which resemble the way Escape from Tarkov handles weapon creation. The first is Weapon Platforms, which encompass all the different possible variants (SMG, DMR, AR, etc.) that are born from a single platform.

                              <span>There has been a number of different efforts in recent time to further enhance the Linux kernel&#x27;s scheduler to better adapt to modern hardware architectures whether it be for Intel hybrid CPU designs, adapting to new CPU cache configurations, or just better scaling with today&#x27;s ever-increasing core counts. Another scheduler effort detailed this week is &quot;Nest&quot; that aims to keep tasks on &quot;warm cores&quot; with hopes of lower latency due to being already at higher clock/performance states and ideally operating at an optimal turbo/boost frequency. The Nest developers find that their scheduler &quot;improves performance 10%-2x and can reduce energy usage&quot; with modern hardware...</span>

                              <span>Back in November I wrote up a list of 25 things I would 3D print.
Let&#x27;s revisit the list and see how things have developed.
Stuff I won&#x27;t print

Some kind of 45° leaning prong to dry bottles and flasks on
A tea tray and coasters
Small tins to keep loose-leaf tea in
It was pointed out to me that you can&#x27;t safely print things to store food in
with most materials, as their porous/layered nature facilitates the growth of
bacteria. So, I&#x27;ll rule out those items.
A vinyl record.


The size of the grooves in a vinyl record are smaller than conventional FDM
printers can achieve.
Things I&#x27;ve printed
a replacement prop arm/foot for my computer keyboard


Someone has modelled the exact part I need, and it worked great:

                              <span>More ICFP-inspired experiments using the rec-def library: In Norman Ramsey’s very nice talk about his Functional Pearl “Beyond Relooper: Recursive Translation of Unstructured Control Flow to Structured Control Flow”, he had the following slide showing the equation for the dominators of a node in a graph:
He said “it’s ICFP and I wanted to say the dominance relation has a beautiful set of equations … you can read all these algorithms how to compute this, but the concept is simple”.
This made me wonder: If the concept is simple and this formula is beautiful – shouldn’t this be sufficient for the Haskell programmer to obtain the dominator relation, without reading all those algorithms?
Before we start, we have to clarify the formula a bit: If a node is an entry node (no predecessors) then the…</span>

                              <span>Last night I complained that git&#x27;s SSH signature format didn&#x27;t support using SSH certificates rather than raw keys, and was swiftly corrected, once again highlighting that the best way to make something happen is to complain about it on the internet in order to trigger the universe to retcon it into existence to make you look like a fool. But anyway. Let&#x27;s talk about making this work!
git&#x27;s SSH signing support is actually just it shelling out to ssh-keygen with a specific set of options, so let&#x27;s go through an example of this with ssh-keygen. First, here&#x27;s my certificate:
$ ssh-keygen -L -f id_aurora-cert.pub
id_aurora-cert.pub:

                              <span>At this week’s International Conference on Functional Programming I showed my rec-def Haskell library to a few people. As this crowd appreciates writing compilers, and example from the realm of program analysis is quite compelling.
To Throw or not to throw
Here is our little toy language to analyze: It has variables, lambdas and applications, non-recursive (lazy) let bindings and, so that we have something to analyze, a way to throw and to catch exceptions:
type Var &#x3D; String

data Exp
  &#x3D; Var Var
  | Throw
  | Catch Exp
  | Lam Var Exp
  | App Exp Exp
  | Let Var Exp Exp

Given such an expression, we would like to know whether it might throw an exception. Such an analysis is easy to write: We traverse the syntax tree, remembering in the env which of the variables may throw an exception:

                              <span>In the operation of a normal Linux system there are many secrets stored on behalf of a user. Wifi passwords, passwords from web sites, etc. Ideally you want them to be quickly and conveniently accessible to the rightful user but also be as difficult as possible for hostile parties to access.
The solution in GNOME and KDE is to have a wallet that is encrypted to store such passwords, the idea is that if a hostile party gets access to a PC that doesn’t use full disk encryption then the secrets will be protected. This is an OK feature. In early versions it required entering a password every time you logged in. The current default mode of operation is to have the login password used to decrypt the wallet which is very convenient.
The problem is the case where the user login password has a scop…</span>

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Gran Turismo movie continues to progress, with Stranger Things star David Harbour having now joined the cast.


Sony&#x27;s live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Harbour is the first member of the cast to be officially revealed (thanks The Hollywood Reporter) and he&#x27;ll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who&#x27;s helming the project.


Blomkamp will be directing from a script by Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), which dramatises an apparently true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver.

And if you missed its typically meandering reveals, you can check out everything that put in an appearance, considerably more succinctly, below.

Eville


Eville is a multiplayer social deduction game from developer VestGames that&#x27;s coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 11th October. It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.

Plazas and Promenades, which was announced back in August, brings a new pedestrianisation focus to developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder, giving players the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


Pedestrian Streets can be placed like any other road to create green city centres largely free of vehicles and pollution. These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.

Fortnite&#x27;s next season is set to begin this Sunday, 18th September, as its peaceful summer party gets consumed by chrome-coloured goo.

                              <span>Eight years after its initial launch, EA&#x27;s is making its enormously popular life sim The Sims 4 permanently free-to-play, beginning Tuesday, 18th October.


From that point onward, The Sims 4&#x27;s base game (which is currently priced at £17.99/£19.99 USD) will be available to download at no cost across all platforms - that is, PC, Mac, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. There&#x27;s no talk of pricing changes for the game&#x27;s extensive DLC catalogue - which totals 12 Expansion Packs, 12 Game Packs, 18 Stuff Packs, and 15 Kit Packs at present - so it appears to be business as usual on that front for now.


In a post announcing today&#x27;s news, EA said it will &quot;continue to develop and release packs, kits and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future&quot; following The Sims 4 base game&#x27;s transition to free-to-play, with more on its future plans set to be shared in a special developer livestream airing on 18th October at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT.

According to the official Nintendo website, you&#x27;ll play as Alear &quot;who awakens a thousand years after the war [between Elyos and the Fell Dragon] with no memory of their past&quot;. 

Perhaps that&#x27;s the in-game explanation for the odd fashion choices for Alear, then.

                              <span>Ahead of Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s release next week, I sat down with series creator Ron Gilbert, co-writer Dave Grossman and art director Rex Crowle to discuss the series&#x27; surprise revival. It&#x27;s a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool&#x27;s Day announcement a few months ago. 
Speaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert&#x27;s shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series&#x27; iconic distraction of &quot;Look! A three-headed monkey&quot;. Apparently, this move works &quot;every time&quot;.)
In addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.

Last year, in an article by Japanese news site Nikkan Taishu, it was revealed that Sega wished to publish the Judgment games on PC through Steam but were being blocked by actor Takuya Kimura&#x27;s management agency.

Kimura plays private investigator Takayuki Yagami, the main character of the Judgment games.

The practice was previously commonplace pre-Covid, and frequently prompted outpourings of excitement at major Nintendo game reveals. 


Well, as we know, yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct had plenty of those - and the assembled group of fans reacted as well as you might expect to word of Pikmin 4, Fire Emblem Engage, and the name for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

This test - and indeed our recent interview with Intel - came about in the wake of our AMD FSR 2.0 vs DLSS vs native rendering analysis, where we devised a gauntlet of image quality scenarios to really put these new technologies through their paces. We suggested to Intel that we&#x27;d love to put XeSS to the test in a similar way and the company answered the challenge, providing us with pre-release builds and a top-of-the-line Arc A770 GPU to test them on.


XeSS is exciting stuff. It&#x27;s what I consider to be a second generation upscaler. First-gen efforts, such as checkerboarding, DLSS 1.0 and …</span>

Along with finally getting its name revealed - Tears of the Kingdom - we also got some new footage. And where there is new footage, you can be sure that Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and I will not be far behind with our theories about what it all means for the next instalment in the Zelda series.

                              <span>343 Industries, the developer behind Xbox&#x27;s blockbuster Halo series, has reportedly lost another high-profile figure.


David Berger, who served as lead developer on Infinite&#x27;s ambitious Slipspace Engine technology, will leave the studio - according to reports by Windows Central and Lords of Gaming.


News of the departure comes just days after 343&#x27;s boss Bonnie Ross announced her own exit from the company after 15 years, to attend to a family medical issue.

                              <span>Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That&#x27;s the word that keeps springing to mind when I try to sum up my time with PlayStation VR2. As a fervent fan of VR for many years now, it&#x27;s safe to say that my first hands-on experience with Sony&#x27;s upcoming headset wowed my VR-loving socks off. This sleek and stylish unit was all I could have wanted for an upgraded PSVR headset and much, much more.
In terms of technological and visual quality, this feels like one of the more memorable generational console leaps. Experiencing the difference in visuals between the PSVR1 and the PSVR2 brought back memories of graduating to the sparkly, sharp, high-definition games of a PS3 after spending years playing games on the PS2 in standard definition.
Even the visuals afforded by my beefy PC VR rig seemed to pale in comparison to some of the wonders I witnessed whilst inside the PSVR2 and you can watch me breathlessly gush over it in the video below. There&#x27;s around 40 minutes of PSVR2 information and impressions in there, including detailed close-ups of the kit, descriptions on how to calibrate the headset for eye-tracking and room-scale VR and beautiful 4K footage of the four game demos I played; Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village, The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy&#x27;s Edge - Enhanced Edition

                              <span>Yakuza fans have it pretty good right now. Like a Dragon 8 and a Kiryu spin-off just got announced, but most importantly of all, Ishin is getting not just a localisation, but a full remake and worldwide release.

For non-Yakuza fans, it looks a bit confusing. Why are we so excited about an eight year old PS3/4 game being playable in English?

To explain, we need to look back on the Yakuza series as a whole.

                              <span>Yet another new Yakuza game was announced during the Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit today. 

Titled as Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, this game will follow the story of former gangster Kiryu Kazuma from the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life up until Like a Dragon 8.

A trailer was released, showing Kiryu being disciplined at a monastery, having seemingly renounced all of his former life, before it&#x27;s revealed that Kiryu is in fact still involved with the Daidoji family from Yakuza 6.

                              <span>This year has given us a fresh bounty of farming sims to harvest.

Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct alone gave us five forthcoming farming sims: Harvestella (which now has a demo), Rune Factory 3 Special, another new Rune Factory, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, and Fae Farm. Plus Japanese Switch Online subscribers are getting N64 game Harvest Moon 64.





That&#x27;s on top of recent additions like Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Island Sanctuary mode, the quirky Ooblets, and the just-released in early access Disney Dreamlight Valley.

A short trailer revealing Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga and and series poster boy Kiryu Kazuma standing in Kamurocho was shown.

This is the first official reveal of Like a Dragon 8, following the brief glimpse seen in July thanks to a video from inside Sega&#x27;s offices.

                              <span>Nintendo still intends to release Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, though is yet to decide when to do so. 


The turn-based strategy game - believed to be complete and ready to launch - was pulled from release schedules earlier this year due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


Fans had hoped to see Advance Wars 1+2 reannounced during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, though the company made no mention of it at all.

An advert for the game now appears on the Xbox dashboard with the option to pre-order now.


However, selecting the advert takes users to a blank screen as it&#x27;s not yet available on the store itself.

                              <span>Mobile tech company AppLovin has scrapped its plans to buy video game engine Unity, following a failed - and unsolicited - bid last month worth $17.5bn.


AppLovin announced it was backing off in a statement last night (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), saying it had instead decided to remain on &quot;its path as the independent market leader&quot;.


Unity rejected AppLovin&#x27;s bid within a week of it being made, and stated at the time it was &quot;not in the best interests of Unity shareholders&quot;.

                              <span>After six years, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles got an official localisation in 2021. It was well received – Eurogamer gave it a recommended - and went on to sell half a million copies. By all accounts it was a success, and it finally aligned the Ace Attorney franchise&#x27;s releases inside and outside of Japan. Except for one game.
Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is a bizarre quirk in an already bizarre series. The original Investigations game is a spinoff featuring Miles Edgeworth, a fan favourite from the original trilogy. It puts his emotional arc at its centre, ending up much more character-focused than the mainline games. The sequel, released in 2011, follows suit, rehashing some areas but extending the thematic resonance of others. It is also the only one of the 11 Ace Attorney games that has not been officially localised.
Investigations 2 is playable in English thanks to a fan localisation that was released in 2015, four years after the game first came out. It&#x27;s a great localisation, and combined with the quality of the game itself, it&#x27;s very popular among those who have played it. But not many have. Its lack of official release in the West has put it in a strange position. Even as the series keeps growing in popularity and spinoffs like The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles get their deserved success, Investigations 2 remains in the shadows.

We also got word on when we&#x27;d see the programme launch - beginning in &quot;some regions in Asia&quot; from late September onwards. America and Europe will then see Stars arrive &quot;in the weeks that follow&quot;.


Collectibles shown included 3D models of Ape Escape, Sony&#x27;s bizarre ChordMachine boombox, a PlayStation 3, Sony&#x27;s feline mascot Toro, the PocketStation peripheral.

Like a Dragon: Ishin originally released for PS3 and PS4 in Japan (under the name Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!) back in 2014, transplanting the chaotic Yakuza formula to the Late Edo Period for a historical slice of samurai action.


It follows protagonist Sakamoto Ryōma as he returns to his home in Tosa where, after a run-in with a high-ranking samurai, he&#x27;s sentenced to be executed.

Next up, a game for PSVR2: Star Wars Tales from the Galaxy&#x27;s Edge Enhanced Edition. This one&#x27;s out next year.

                              <span>We had an elusive tease at Evo earlier in the year, but now it is time for the real deal. Opening up Sony&#x27;s State of Play, Tekken 8 was officially announced - no I am not Tekken the piss. 


This new teaser shows Kazuya and Jin Kazama facing off against each other on a suitably atmospheric backdrop wearing inappropriate clothing. The mother in me wants to get them both a jacket. But I digress. 


You can see this new teaser for Tekken 8 below.

                              <span>SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have released Judgment and its sequel Lost Judgment for PC on Steam.
The original Judgment is an action-adventure detective game that takes place in a crime-ridden Tokyo. In it, you play as Takayuki Yagami, a disgraced defense attorney turned detective working his way through Kamurocho’s underground crime network to uncover the truth behind a string of grisly murders.
With gameplay, there are two unique battle styles to take down adversaries, and you&#x27;ll have fun with the Hollywood-worthy combat sequences and cinematic twists and turns.

Announced just ahead of TGS 2022 in a livestream, Like a Dragon 8 will star Kazuma Kiryu and Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s Ichiban Kasuga.
With the game&#x27;s announcement, it seems the Yakuza title has been retired in the west, as the developers are opting to call the series by the same name as its Japanese counterpart.

                              <span>Open world games are good and everything, but sometimes they’re just too much. Whether you’re 100 hours into Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and only about 30% through the game, or chasing around Far Cry 6 clearing all the icons off your map, there’s just something about open world games that’s getting tiresome these days. Maybe it’s the proliferation of them – open world games are pretty much the biggest genre out there, right now – or maybe it’s the dwindling nature of our collective attention span. Either way, we’re finding it harder and harder to care. 

And Square Enix knows that. More specifically, Square Enix’s in-house development studio, Luminous Productions knows that. Coming off the back of Final Fantasy 15 (which, let’s face it, wasn’t really an open world game, now was it?), the studio has been keeping a close ear to the ground when it comes to player sentiment about open world games. And – though you may have only laughed at it because of a poorly-delivered trailer – Forspoken wants to do something a bit different with the open world genre to keep you more invested.
“Obviously, from our side, we&#x27;re keeping an eye on what people are saying about open worlds and what the general feelings are in the industry right now,” says Forspoken co-director Takefumi Terada via Square Enix interpreter. “And so we are aware of the sentiment people feel towards [the genre].”

                              <span>If you’ve paid any amount of attention to fighting game fans, influencers, or players over the past year, you’ll know Project L is the looming presence thundering towards us from the murky future. It’s the elephant in the room in the purest sense, a presence that every new release, every new announcement, and every new development in the genre is measured around.
The folks at Riot Games appear to understand the environment they’re walking into; R&amp;D Projects that end up greenlit and pushed into the forefront. The first ever bit of news we ever saw with Project L revolved around the esteemed and experienced staff that were leading development, a strategy Riot had previously used before with Legends of Runeterra and Valorant, which championed big names in their respective genres. This, as it was obviously intended to do, made every 30+ year old buster with an arcade stick a little hot around the collar. Follow that up with announcements of free-to-play, great netcode, and a 2v2 format, and the pants came off.
But, while Riot may have the crowd with boxed copies of Street Fighter 4 hyped, it is arguably far more important for the long term success of Project L that it wins over the non-fighting game crowd. The League, Valorant, Runeterra and Wild Rift communities not only dwarf the FGC, but are most likely the first group of truly fresh players who’ll pick Riot&#x27;s foray into fighting games up first, too. The big question on my mind regarding Project L right now is simply, &#x27;do League of Legends players actually give a shit?&#x27;

                              <span>It appears Arkane&#x27;s Deathloop is set to release on Xbox consoles rather soon if a pre-order ad popping up on Xbox is any indication.
Spotted by reddit user Immediate_Exercise27, the store UI clearly shows a Deathloop pre-order card.
The only thing is, when you click the option, it takes you to a blank store page. Still, this means you can probably expect the game to be available sooner rather than later, as the PlayStation exclusivity period is almost up.

                              <span>Early impressions for the PSVR 2 are out on the internet, thanks to Sony inviting a whole bunch of press and content creators to try out its next big step into the virtual reality battlefield. With goggles on and controllers in hand, several attendees travelled and wrote up their impressions, which we have decided to compile in one place here.
As such, if you’re curious about whether or not the PSVR 2 is making enough progress beyond its previous iteration, you can find a collection of diverse impressions below. Of course, we’ve credited and linked back to each piece, and we highly recommend you jump over and read them all if you’d like to know more!
First up, we have Ian Higton’s excellent write up of their impressions over at Eurogamer. In their extended impressions piece, they cover not only their thoughts on the hardware itself, but also VR titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village, and the enhanced edition of Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge. They kick off their piece with: “Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That&#x27;s the word that keeps springing to mind when I try to sum up my time with PlayStation VR 2. As a fervent fan of VR for many years now, it&#x27;s safe to say that my first hands-on experience with Sony&#x27;s upcoming headset wowed my VR-loving socks off.”

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is pitched as almost a quasi-remake of the first Assassin’s Creed game: it takes place in a similar region, and will modernise much of its gameplay mechanics.
However, Mirage is a different beast, and by focusing on a single city and taking into account all the refinement and iteration that the series has enjoyed since 2007, it may end up playing more like a much younger and frankly criminally underappreciated entry in the series: 2014’s Unity, as I argue in the video above. 
Mirage occurs a couple of decades earlier than the events of Valhalla, and a couple of centuries earlier than the first game, but will essentially bridge the gap between the ancient world trilogy of sprawling RPGs that we’ve been enjoying since Origins, and the action-adventure games of the series’ past: bringing the franchise full circle, and providing a neat stepping stone from the post-Roman world of Eivor, and the Levantine world of Altaïr.

                              <span>What a thrill it’s been to see GoldenEye 007 finally revealed to be making a return on Nintendo Switch and Xbox. Sure, it’s been rumored for a long time, but it was still one of the most electrifying announcements on a day that was, thanks to a Nintendo Direct and State of Play, pretty packed full of ‘em.

It was also an announcement that then gave way to questions and even a twinge of disappointment, as an Xbox version was confirmed – but it just wasn’t what we all thought it would be.

Let’s break it down. GoldenEye is coming to the ‘Nintendo Switch Online’ subscription service as one of many Nintendo 64 titles available on that service. It’s a standard NSO release, which means it’s playable so long as you have the right tier of NSO subscription, and is essentially an emulated N64 game rip, given tweaks and adjustments by Nintendo in order to make it run on Switch, and to handle extra features like online play.

                              <span>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has just gotten itself a brand new season. Titled “A Huntress and a Hag”, the update introduces additional content to the title at zero cost to the play, and without any time gating. You love to see it.
Alongside this season, we’ve got a new trailer showcasing all aspects of the update, as well as some story details for the characters present throughout. Expect to see lots of sneaking, archery, and the Dying Light 2 parkour that you know and love.
As for the exact details of what you can expect, A Huntress and a Hag comes with a new chapter agent, new enemies (including the Hag, a variant of the deadly Banshee), some new melee and ranged weapons, and some new bounties. In addition, the agents playable in chapter one are also getting some new weapons and blueprints, so it’s worth popping back and checking out their new gear too!

                              <span>Do you remember back in 2015 when Shigeru Miyamoto said Pikmin 4 was close to completion? Me neither… but Pikmin fans do. Two years later at E3, Miyamoto was much quieter about where the game stood, while still advising that it was progressing.
Regardless, Pikmin fans won’t need to wait too much longer, we’d hope. During yesterday’s Nintendo Direct, Miyamoto made yet another appearance to finally show off a glimpse of Pikmin 4. There’s still no word on a release date, but we do know to expect the title during 2023.
In the teaser trailer shown off during the presentation, we saw plenty of colourful Pikmin and the Bulborb enemy make their return. The trailer also showed that players would be able to play from an all-new angle, one that’s situated closer to floor level and lets us look at the world of Pikmin from their eye-level.

The Test Your Mettle event will task players with completing challenges using their Steel-type ‘mons. There’ll also be the opportunity to encounter Celesteela (Southern Hemisphere) and Kartana (Northern Hemisphere), two Ultra Beasts.
Aside from those particular Pokémon and encounters, there are also plenty of other additions arriving throughout the event. For a start, players will be able to encounter the following Pokémon, as well as Togedemaru, during Test Your Mettle:

The main benefit of this is, of course, allowing cross-platform chat with Discord users on PC and mobile, but the implementation is not as seamless as you might imagine.
The whole setup hinges on having the Discord mobile app. First, you&#x27;ll need to link your Discord account to your Xbox account. This is necessary, even if you previously linked the two, as there are new permissions you&#x27;ll need to give.

God of War Ragnarok arrives in November, and ahead of the game&#x27;s eagerly-anticipated release date, Sony have shown off perhaps the game&#x27;s most revealing trailer yet.
The trailer, which was debuted during tonight&#x27;s State of Play stream, included looks at both pre-rendered scenes as well as in-engine gameplay, giving us a delectible taste of the sort of experience we&#x27;ll have with the Norse father/son combo later this year.

                              <span>Great news for you character-action fans watching the Sony State of Play tonight, as Stellar Blade (formerly Project Eve) was just shown off via a rad new gameplay and story trailer. The game got much more than just a proper name though, as we now know the title will be coming exclusively to the PS5 in 2023.
The new trailer can be found embedded below, which showcases a lot of excellent high fying, combo-centric melee action like we got only a glimpse off last year in the initial reveal trailer for Project Eve. Now, it looks like that action has only be turned up to 11 in the time away from the spotlight, with sci-fi fighting that has us foaming at the mouth.
In the trailer, we&#x27;re introduced to a variety of new friendly characters that come alongside us in a journey across a ruined and largely abbandoned world. It seems like a gigantic disaster botched the place up something serious, leading to a variety of nasty (and frankly, brilliant looking) enemies all over the gaff.

                              <span>Like a Dragon: Ishin has just been announced at tonight&#x27;s Sony State of Play! A remake of a Yakuza spin-off title previously not available in western markets, the shiny new action game will be available on both PS4 and PS5 in February 2023.
The trailer shows a Yakuza-like ancient Japan filled with very familiar looking characters, clashing with that classic Yakuza comabt albeit with swords and flintlock pistols rather than fists, traffic cones and stray bicycle. In terms of story, it&#x27;s a classic affair for those familiar with the franchise. Our stern-faced protagonist gets caught up in some devious plot, requirng him to go out and fight-off goons across the land.
The original game — Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin! — was originally released in 2014 on PS3 and PS4. The Yakuza has recieved these every now and again and they&#x27;ve always looked like rad and entertaining twists on the franchise. Who can forget the zombie title Yakuza: Dead Souls, which put us in conrol as Majima as he took on hordes of undead with gusto.

                              <span>Are you ready for the next battle? Today during the PlayStation State of Play, Bandai Namco showed off the next entry in the esteemed Tekken series: Tekken 8.
The game was first teased back at EVO 2022 in a &#x27;blink and you&#x27;ll miss it&#x27; teaser. Back then, we weren&#x27;t sure hhether this will be the next canon game in the series, or another spin-off like Tekken Tag Tournament 3 – we have our answer now, though!
In the trailer above, you can see long-term bad guy and all-round terrible father, Kazuya, battle it out with his son and devil-laced master of karate, Jin. Though the footage seems dolled up for trailer, this very much looks like it&#x27;s in-engine – all the good stuff is there; terrain deformation, hit effects, nice 3D camera panning. If the game looks this good in action, we&#x27;re in for a real, proper treat.

                              <span>EA and developers Maxis have revealed today that The Sims 4 will be going free to play from October 18th. You’ll be able to grab it on Steam, Origin or the EA app. There had been rumours circulating online earlier today that an announcement was incoming from EA on this, and those were evidently legit. More information on the future of The Sims will be coming on October 18th too, EA said, at an event dubbed the Behind The Sims Summit.

The game’s part of a “transmedia sci-fi franchise” being worked on by very bluntly named devs Game Studio, according to publishers Bandai Namco. The game’s out in 2023, though. Suit up and boot up by watching the trailer below.

Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

I’ve already reported on Like A Dragon 8, which stars Kiryu and new series main character Ichiban Kasuga, but devs Ryu Go Gotoku Studio also revealed that another game is coming in 2023. It&#x27;ll explain what happened to Kiryu in his temporary absence from the series and is called, and I’m not making this up, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. To prove it to you, you can watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Following a similar move by Activision Blizzard last year, EA has unveiled EA AntiCheat (EAAC), a new internally developed kernel-level anti-cheat system that&#x27;ll initially be rolling out with the launch of FIFA 23 on PC this autumn.


Announcing EAAC - which is officially described as a &quot;kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution&quot; - in a new blog post, the publisher explained, &quot;PC cheat developers have increasingly moved into the kernel, so we need to have kernel-mode protections to ensure fair play and tackle PC cheat developers on an even playing field.&quot;


EAAC&#x27;s arrival will coincide with the release of FIFA 23, which brings cross-play across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation to the series for the first time. &quot;In addition to EAAC protecting our PC players from cheaters,&quot; EA notes, &quot;our console players who match with PC opponents will also be protected from cheaters operating on PC platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt update, which lets players leave the boundaries of Appalachia for the first time, is out today on Xbox and PC.


Announced back in June 2021, The Pitt - which is inspired by the Fallout 3 add-on of the same name - takes players to a city built on the remains of post-nuclear Pittsburgh, which can explore by embarking on Expeditions, a brand-new feature introduced in today&#x27;s update.


Expeditions are essentially repeatable missions for up to four players that feature new NPCs and new foes to battle, with participants able to earn various in-game rewards for their endeavours. Bethesda says anyone can take part in these new activities but recommends that players be level 50+ &quot;for the best experience&quot;.

                              <span>Following a period of Xbox Insider testing announced earlier this year, Microsoft has officially launched Discord voice chat support for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S users.


As of today, anyone on either console will be able to connect directly to Discord Voice chats in order to talk with their friends, wherever they may be. The actual process required to do so, though, is a little convoluted, and first demands that users link their Xbox account to their Discord account - a process that&#x27;ll need to be redone if done previously, so new permissions needed for voice chat on Xbox can be confirmed.


With that step complete, you&#x27;ll next need to make sure you have the Xbox mobile app installed on your phone, and that you console is linked to the app. That done, fire up Discord on either your mobile device or desktop and join the Voice call you want to transfer to Xbox. From here, select the transfer call option, which will automatically open the Xbox mobile app.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct did not disappoint, with a brand new look at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel, the newly-titled Tears of the Kingdom, plus surprise announcements for Pikmin 4, GoldenEye 007 and a new Fire Emblem game. 
Nintendo finally confirmed Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s name and a release date: 12th May 2023 - plus new details on what to expect from Link&#x27;s next adventure, which will apparently take him &quot;to the vast lands of Hyrule... up into the skies and [into] an expanded world that goes beyond that.&quot;
Originally confirmed to Eurogamer by Shigeru Miyamoto in 2015, Nintendo finally gave us an official first teaser for Pikmin 4. I can&#x27;t quite believe it&#x27;s still in development, but it is, and it is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2023.

As revealed in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta will be up against man-made bioweapons called Homunculi. She&#x27;ll be joined by series favourites Luka, Jeanne, and new ally Viola.


Perhaps the biggest addition (literally) to combat this time are the infernal demons.

                              <span>Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved construction and management sim Factorio will be making its way to Switch on 28th October.


Factorio, which has garnered a seemingly endless procession of rave reviews since entering Steam early access all the way back in 2016 (it got its full release in 2020), casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation.


Ultimately, the goal is to build a rocket ship and escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on - a process that begins by farming natural resources to create basic machines which, in turn, open up more and more construction possibilities the further you travel along the tech tree. Eventually, with the planet&#x27;s hostile local wildlife dead and conveyor belts stretching as far as the eye can see, freedom should, hopefully, be yours.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct revealed a lot of surprises - including, of course, the long overdue re-reveal of Pikmin 4 seven whole years after Miyamoto first told us about it - but one of the biggest shocks didn&#x27;t even get a place in the western broadcast. It turns out that Clap Hanz just quietly released its latest golf game on the eShop, rebranded as Easy Come, Easy Golf. 


It&#x27;s effectively a re-release of Clap Hanz Golf, which we first saw on Apple Arcade last April, and which was the developer&#x27;s first non-PlayStation foray. On PlayStation, Clap Hanz was behind the brilliant Everybody&#x27;s Golf series, games we&#x27;ve been championing on Eurogamer for some time. Clap Hanz Golf was essentially more Everybody&#x27;s Golf on a different platform - so to see it reborn on the Switch where it can be played with traditional controls is a very welcome thing indeed. 


You can find Easy Come Easy Golf on the Switch right now, where it currently costs £17.59.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming fantasy farming game Harvestella is getting a Switch eShop demo today, ahead of its 4th November release.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - casts players as an amnesiac who wakes up in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


What follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella&#x27;s dungeon-like regions where they&#x27;ll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.

Village, of course, is the direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Resident Evil 7 and follows that game&#x27;s protagonist, Ethan Winters, as he travels to a mysterious village filled with mutant creatures - and some exceptionally tall ladies - in order to find his kidnapped daughter.


There&#x27;s a demo version out today on Switch&#x27;s eShop, and Capcom says it&#x27;ll also be releasing Village&#x27;s previously announced Winters&#x27; Expansion - promising the likes of new story content and a new third-person mode - for Switch on 2nd December.

                              <span>Announced during the latest Nintendo Direct, Tunic is coming to the Nintendo Switch on September 27th, the same day the little Zelda-inspired fox hits PS4 and PS5.
Tunic was previously only available on Xbox consoles, PC and Mac, and was also a day one Xbox Game Pass title.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with Tunic, it&#x27;s an indie game primarily developed by just one person, Andrew Shouldice, who was inspired by early Zelda games and their detailed manuals, particularly Zelda II - but don&#x27;t let that put you off.

                              <span>Octopath Traveler 2 was announced during this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, and will launch on Switch 24th February 2023. The Square Enix Japan OT2 trailer also notes Steam, PS4 and PS5 releases for the game (thanks, commenter TinyKaiju! Great name, too).
The sequel takes place in a new era and involves eight new characters whose adventures you&#x27;ll get to individually play. The era appears to be more modern and reminds me of a kind of 18th/19th Century. There are huge, ocean-going ships but also trains of a kind, probably steam. And it looks as deliciously dinky and delicate as Octopath Traveler did before it.
Characters will also apparently now have different path actions at day and night, and there&#x27;s specific mention of their stories intertwining in this game.

Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto first confirmed Pikmin 4 to me as part of an interview with Eurogamer back in 2015. It&#x27;s fair to say we&#x27;ve been waiting on this one for a while.


In 2017, I asked Miyamoto about the project again - and heard from the Nintendo legend that it was still progressing. I never gave up hope.

This Switch port, annouced as part of today&#x27;s Direct, will offer local wireless play via a Friends Pass which lends this version of It Takes Two its own edge.

The twosome must work together to complete multiple tests presented to them by It Takes Two&#x27;s relationship therapist, Dr. Hakim... The Book of Love.

                              <span>Happy Nintendo Direct day! And this promises to be a very happy one indeed, with 40 minutes of news and - fingers crossed - potential for a big update on Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel. There&#x27;s room for plenty more besides too, so join us from 3pm BST for all the fun! (And the inevitable disappointment when we don&#x27;t get precisely what we want, of course. Traditions!)

                              <span>Around these parts there is no higher praise than &quot;double-A&quot;. It may sometimes be a reflection on the budget, but never on the skill and craft and imagination of the developers. A great double-A game is often a quirky affair built around immediate pleasures and often delivered with a twist. 


One of the things I&#x27;ve only realised recently is how double-As like to find a groove to settle in en-masse. For a while this was &quot;third-person shooter with a gimmick&quot;, so you got Fracture and its terrain deformation, or Red Faction with all those walls coming down. Then we had open-worlds, whether you were a Saint or in a UFO, and endless cover shooters, with stuff like - well, there were a lot of cover shooters indeed.


I am pretty sure that in a previous era Steelrising would have been a cover shooter. That sounds mean and I absolutely don&#x27;t intend it that way. What I mean is it&#x27;s a Soulslike today in part at least because Soulslikes are the perfect contemporary style for double-A development. You get a framework that is recognisable and satisfying on which to build out your specific double-A charms. I hadn&#x27;t noticed until I suddenly looked around how many double-As are opting for the souls approach.

An early sample of the device, apparently left behind by accident, was recently discovered by hotel worker Ramiro Cardenas - after he responded to complaints of a pile of rubbish left in a bag in a corridor.


Cardenas, a VR fan, quickly realised what the device actually was - and promptly posted a series of photos and videos on the internet.

The 40-minute Nintendo Direct broadcast begins at 3pm UK time. Note that Nintendo UK will not be broadcasting the stream because of the period of national mourning that&#x27;s ongoing here. But you can watch it via the Nintendo US stream embedded in this piece.
So, let&#x27;s speculate. Ready, steady, go.

                              <span>Square Enix and PlatinumGames are binning off their beleagured live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall. 


Future updates planned for the game have been scrapped, and its servers will go dark on 28th February next year. After that, you will no longer be able to log in and play.


Babylon&#x27;s Fall only launched in March this year, but has struggled to attract players from the get-go. Square Enix confirmed it was pulling the plug this morning, and said it would run a final season of content from November until the game goes dark.

                              <span>CD Projekt is &quot;totally, fully committed&quot; to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, despite Phantom Liberty confirmed as the game&#x27;s only expansion.



Michał Nowakowski, CD Projekt&#x27;s vice president of business development, confirmed the news during a recent earnings call (thanks IGN).



&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; said Nowakowski. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion.

                              <span>You spend a lot of your time in Roadwarden tracing the footsteps of the previous roadwarden - a man named Asterion sent, like you, into a swampy, forested peninsula to safeguard the paths against beasts and the elements, tend to a handful of villages, and assess the region&#x27;s resources on behalf of a merchant guild back in the big city. Asterion haunts the peninsula much like the protagonist’s identity in Disco Elysium - a game with which Roadwarden has much in common, for all its Robin Hobb-esque historical fantasy backdrop. He exists now as a trail of unkept promises, deliveries not made, conversations unfinished and grand plans that seemingly went nowhere. 


I admit, when I started the game I felt a little contemptuous of him. Roadwarden&#x27;s setting is hardly gigantic – dredged map node by node from the fog of war, it consists of a single road looping a dense, watchful wilderness – and many of the problems you encounter seem trifling. A monk awaits a package of fine quills. A couple of foragers need help lassoing and subduing a massive, flightless bird. A carpenter wants you to shore up a ford. This isn&#x27;t Dragon Age or Skyrim, but a deceptively sleepy choose-your-own adventure with deceptively delicate RPG appendages, its locations consisting of terse yet evocative descriptions and nested dialogue choices, beautiful eight-colour isometric dioramas and a soundtrack of animal sounds and melancholy guitar. 


There are no armies to slay and no ability trees to scale, though you might pick up a new axe and a fancier padded jacket on your voyages. Your first few conversations with soldiers and innkeepers suggest a society of needy bystanders to be systematically won over by fetching herbs and rescuing lost puppies. How hard can it be, I thought. But the more I played, the more setbacks I encountered, and the more I came to identify with my missing predecessor.

Koei Tecmo and its studio Omega Force, which is also behind the Hyrule Warriors games for Nintendo, are working with EA on &quot;the next great hunting game&quot;, EA said in a note to press this morning.


It&#x27;s described as an original intellectual property, and a &quot;truly AAA experience&quot; based in fantasy feudal Japan. More information will be announced later this month, EA added. Concept art is below:

                              <span>Sony has announced it&#x27;ll be airing a new instalment of its State of Play digital showcase tomorrow, 13th September, highlighting a range of PS5, PS4, and PSVR2 games.


It&#x27;s a late one for those of us in the UK, alas, kicking off at 11pm BST/3pm PT/6pm ET, but it should be decently eventful too, promising around 20 minutes of reveals, updates, and gameplay for a total of 10 games.


What those games are remains a mystery, but Sony does tease &quot;great updates from our amazing Japanese partners, along with a few other surprises from developers all around the world&quot;.

                              <span>New comments by Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot suggest the publisher will be adopting the increasingly industry standard $70 USD price point for its &quot;big AAA&quot; titles in the future.


It&#x27;s a price point that&#x27;s already been adopted by many publishers - including the likes of Sony, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox - on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but Ubisoft, for its part, insisted it had &quot;not made any decision yet&quot; when asked about bumping its prices up during an investor call last year.


However, it seemed like the publisher might finally have made its mind up when, back in July, it announced its upcoming pirate adventure Skull and Bones would cost $70/£70 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S - and now CEO Guillemot has indicated this will be the norm going forward.

                              <span>Adventure platformer Little Orpheus was meant to launch on PC back in March but was delayed at the last minute. At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

Well, now it looks like Yakuza&#x27;s detective agency spin-offs are also heading to PC, as 2018&#x27;s Judgment and 2021&#x27;s Lost Judgment have both received an ESRB rating for &quot;Windows PC&quot;.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

The announcement was buried amongst a whole bundle of other JRPG information from today’s Nintendo Direct broadcast. You’ll have to make do with the Switch trailer below for now, I’m afraid, because Squeenix haven’t released a PC one yet.

The show may have hit whatever the 21st century equivalent of airwaves is and become a tangible piece of media to consume now, but CD Projekt have confirmed in an earnings call that they’re still “fully committed” to continuing with the Cyberpunk IP. I can’t believe I just typed the term IP.

The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

                              <span>Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I&#x27;m more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Direct, Nintendo announced a swath of Nintendo 64 games coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.
You already heard GoldenEye 007 is included in the batch, and while it&#x27;s the biggie of the bunch, more games were announced.
Nintendo plans to add  &#x3D;Pilotwings 64, Mario Party, and Mario Party 2 this year.

                              <span>Back on the 3DS, there was a pair of rhythm games that got a wide launch called Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call. They launched in 2012 and 2014, respectively, and anyone you speak to that loves the series – and the 3DS as a platform - will have nothing but good things to say about both games.
After that, an arcade game, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: All-Star Carnival, was released in Japan (and this poor sap even made a point of hunting it down when they were out there for a holiday) but the series ground to a halt. From 2016 onwards, there was nothing. Until now.
Fast forward some six years, and we get a brand new game in the series – and it&#x27;s coming to Nintendo Switch and PS4. Titled Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the game was announced during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct as a Switch title, but marketing materials that arrived after also confirmed that the game will arrive on PS4 (and PS5 via backwards compatibility).

In a war against the Fell Dragon, four kingdoms worked together with heroes from other worlds to seal away this great evil. One thousand years later, this seal has weakened and the Fell Dragon is about to reawaken, and it is your job to stop it.

We&#x27;ve added the bold for emphasis, because it&#x27;s very different to what you see on the Nintendo version.
Over on the official 007 press site (yes, it exists), the Nintendo game is confirmed to have online multiplayer. Exclusive online multiplayer.

In the latest look at the game, the video showed our heroine meeting with journalist Luka and another Umbra Witch, Jeanne, who have &quot;overcome their past histories with her.&quot;
Throughout the Bayonetta series, she’s gone from fighting for herself to fighting for others, and now she is fighting for the world. To help her along the way, the new feisty witch-in-training Viola and her feline demon, Cheshire, join in on the action.

                              <span>I&#x27;m very much a horror fanatic, but I&#x27;m simultaneously a cosy gamer through and through. That said, when the Nintendo Direct revealed that not one, not two, but four main instalments in the Resident Evil series would be coming to Nintendo Switch via the Cloud, I jumped for joy.
Kicking things off is Resident Evil Village. The eighth and most recent instalment in the series will arrive on Switch as of October 28, with the Winter&#x27; Expansion DLC accompanying it on December 2.
In addition to being able to get up close and personal with Lady Dimitrescu from your Switch, you&#x27;ll also be able to spend some time with Jack Baker, Tyrant, and Nemesis from the comfort of your bed, sofa, or wherever you choose to play your Switch games. Resident Evil Biohazard, plus the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes, all currently have Cloud versions in development with releases planned for later this year. Looks like a cosy Christmas with Chris Redfield for me!

Thanks to today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, though, we learned that the game will also come to Nintendo Switch consoles on the same day.
If you&#x27;re a regular on this site, you know how I feel about Tunic by now – I&#x27;ve already popped off about it being an &quot;oblique adventure gem&quot; and &quot;absolutely essential&quot;. I&#x27;m just writing this news piece to put it in fron of you once again, and urge you to play it.
In my Tunic review at the start of the year, I said:

                              <span>I guess you could call it the moment that we&#x27;ve all been waiting for. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel has had a release date announced at long last, as well as an official title revealed. It was the icing on the cake for a Nintendo Direct already packed with announcements, more-than-welcome remakes, and an appearance from Shigeru Miyamoto.
Named The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Link&#x27;s never-ending adventure is set to continue on 12 May 2023 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch.
Given the brief teaser trailer shown during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, as well as what we already know, it’s clear to see that Tears of the Kingdom will oversee Link taking to the skies. Of course, he’s still got unfinished business to tend to across Hyrule, but this latest entry in the Zelda series will see Link soaring up high too.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the Japanese company announced today that Rare is releasing GoldenEye 007 HD on Nintendo Switch and Xbox. The title is a remaster of the cult classic Nintendo 64 title first hit consoles way back in 1997.
There&#x27;s no release date listed just yet, but a tweet from developer Rare confirms that the game will be &#x27;coming soon&#x27;.
It seems from the wording of the Rare tweets that Xbox users will get a version of the game that has been &quot;faithfully recreated for Xbox consoles&quot;. This version – on Xbox, of course – includes achievements, 4K resolution and a smoother framerate and, per the developer, will even let you play in split-screen local multiplayer.

                              <span>For those logging into World of Warcraft Classic right now, there’s a major push for great gear ahead of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion launch. For many, this grind is taking place in PvP, where honor points can be easily farmed and powerful PvP gear can be obtained relatively quick. However, there’s a barrier to this. It’s not bad team mates (although those don’t help), and it’s not a class or a bug. It’s a playstyle - dubbed the “Russian Meta”.
First off, we need to go over how Alterac Valley works for the uninformed. It’s essentially a giant battleground filled with towers, bunkers, and a boss at each faction&#x27;s HQ. Each team has 600 reinforcements (respawns), and the goal is to either wipe out the enemy team’s boss, or whittle down their lives. This might sound like it takes a while, but taking out enemy towers and bunkers reduces enemy reinforcements, and weakens their boss.
As such, a fast and “efficient” method was coined for finishing up games of AV as fast as possible. This “European meta” has both teams essentially pass each other at the centre of the map without fighting at all. Then, both teams quick try to take out a mini-boss, two towers and both bunkers in the enemy HQ before taking down the boss. It’s a rat race, with both teams seeing who can zurg down the PvE elements the fastest.

                              <span>The next major release from EA Originals, the EA label typically responsible for smaller projects from indie teams, is one you may not have seen coming if you don&#x27;t tend to keep up with industry rumours.
EA is partnering with Omega Force, the Koei Tecmo studio responsible for the Warriors series - Samurai Warriors, Dynasty Warriors and others. The developer is working on a new AAA IP that&#x27;s set in a fantasy version of feudal Japan. 
EA called the project, &quot;the next great hunting game,&quot; suggesting it&#x27;s a Monster Hunter-style action RPG, though the publisher didn&#x27;t reveal any details. The good news is that more information will be shared later this month, potentially at TGS, given the studios and publishers involved.

This also means, given that Babylon&#x27;s Fall is an online-only game, that no one will be able to play it once servers are shutdown.
The developer announced February 27, 2023 as the last day anyone will be able to play the online action RPG, meaning Babylon&#x27;s Fall will have lasted less than a year since its release in March this year.
&quot;With the desire of delivering an exhilarating online multiplayer action RPG set in an elaborate high fantasy world, we launched the game’s official service on Thursday, March 3, 2022, and have continued to undertake additional development and operations,&quot; said PlatinumGames in an official statement.

Today, September 13 at 3pm PT, 6pm ET, 11pm BST, we&#x27;ll be treated to roughly 20 minutes of reveals, updates on previously announced games, and new gameplay footage.
The show will feature ten games overall - for PS4, PS5 and the upcoming PS VR2. Though the focus is on Japanese games, Sony said we should expect games from all over the world.

                              <span>Introduction: an immutable OS
The Steam Deck runs SteamOS, a single-user operating system based on Arch Linux. Although derived from a standard, package-based distro, the OS in the Steam Deck is immutable and system updates replace the contents of the root filesystem atomically instead of using the package manager.
An immutable OS makes the system more stable and its updates less error-prone, but users cannot install additional packages to add more software. This is not a problem for most users since they are only going to run Steam and its games (which are stored in the home partition). Nevertheless, the OS also has a desktop mode which provides a standard Linux desktop experience, and here it makes sense to be able to install more software.

                              <span>Now that Ubuntu 22.10 is into its feature freeze and its Linux 5.19 based kernel landed as well as moving to the GCC 12.2 compiler, I&#x27;ve begun testing this forthcoming Ubuntu Linux (non-LTS) release on more systems. For the current-flagship Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 &quot;Ice Lake&quot; processors, Ubuntu 22.10 does deliver some performance advantages over the current Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS release. However, Ubuntu 22.10 still trails in a distance behind Intel&#x27;s own Clear Linux platform for the most aggressive out-of-the-box performance.</span>

                              <span>Bonnie Ross, the founder and head of Halo developer 343 Industries, has announced her departure from the studio and Microsoft.


Ross, who also serves as Microsoft corporate vice president, has been the head of 343 Industries for 15 years, having established the studio - specifically to take over development of the Halo franchise from Bungie - back in 2007.


Announcing her departure from 343 in a statement shared on Twitter, Ross explained, &quot;While I had hoped to stay with Halo until we released the Winter Update, I am letting you know I will be leaving 343 and attending a family medical issue&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox has revealed a big free quality of life update for prison management sim Prison Architect - aptly known as the Free for Life update - which launches today on Xbox and PC.


Free for Life is, according to Paradox, focussed on implementing the Prison Architect community&#x27;s most requested features so &quot;players can spend more time managing their compound rather than navigating menus&quot;.


To that end, it brings a range of enhancements, including an improved scheduler and prison log - the latter enabling players to more easily check inmates&#x27; activities, as well as &quot;uncover misconducts ahead of time and keep track of who gets released, reformed, or reoffended&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced an array of new Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, and Eurogamer has exclusive details on how Ubisoft&#x27;s flagship franchise will be shaken up by the arrival of its ambitious new Infinity platform, which will redefine the scope and ongoing story of future releases.

Outside of the Animus, this past weekend was also a major moment for Ubisoft itself, as it emerged from a period of relative silence following a bruising few years of scandal, takeover rumours, and further discontent surrounding its NFT plans. If you missed it, I spoke with Ubisoft boss Yves Guillmot about all of that.
Ubisoft Forward seemed aptly named, with a look over the horizon to a brighter future for the company. But questions remain - as Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

Geralt himself, Henry Cavill, shared a special message with the cast and crew on the last day.


&quot;What a season this has been! I just wanted to thank you all for your determination and dedication through a tough shoot,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Ubisoft has reassured fans concerned over listings for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage which stated it would include &quot;Real Gambling&quot;, as part of &quot;Adults Only&quot; and &quot;18+&quot; ratings for the title. 


At the time of writing, a US Xbox store listing still warns that Mirage contains &quot;Intense Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Partial Nudity, Real Gambling&quot;, and lists it as having received the rare Adults Only 18+ label from the ESRB, the US&#x27; ratings board.


A UK listing similarly mentions &quot;Real Gambling&quot;, alongside &quot;Extreme Violence&quot;, and lists it with a PEGI 18+ rating.

Season one was called Free For All, and was (obviously) related to the free-to-play soft relaunch Fall Guys had back in June.

Season two is titled Satellite Scramble, and is all about (you guessed it) space!

                              <span>Having skipped a week with our usual, scheduled DF Direct show in favour of The Last of Us and Intel Arc specials, we have plenty of news and discussion to catch up with, starting with the news that a brand new PlayStation 5 revision is en route to our shores now, having already made its debut in Australia. Tech journalist Austin Evans has already imported a unit, dismantled it and got to the bottom of what makes it different - and lighter - than the existing units.
We&#x27;re looking to go hands-on with the unit as soon as it arrives in the UK, but what Evans has discovered is intriguing - a completely redesigned, much smaller, mainboard along with another smaller revision of the heat sink along with other internal changes within the existing PlayStation 5 casing. Annoying from a future-proofing perspective is that the CMOS battery on the board now resides under the cooling assembly, so when this does inevitably run out of juice years down the road, replacing it will be a far from an easy job.
From my perspective, it is the power consumption numbers that are most interesting. Evans talks about a reduced power draw compared to the prior units he&#x27;s tested, but the nature of the observation is inconclusive in that his CFI-1100 power draw number was actually higher than his figure taken from the launch unit, while this one is correspondingly lower. Fundamentally, the silicon did not change between CFI-1000 and CFI-1100, so is this reduced power draw actually down to a chip revision? Or is it simply down to variances in the quality of the silicon - which can change on a per chip basis? Or maybe Sony has moved onto lower power memory modules? Regardless, a power consumption figure in or around 200W is still in the broad ballpark of the launch machine.

This has included small changes within the cinematics to the various interactive props found throughout the game&#x27;s post-apocalyptic setting.


Now, however, one player has shared what seems to be none other than Dunder Mifflin from NBC&#x27;s mockumentary The Office tucked away in Part 1. 


As shown in the clip below, you can see Joel taking shelter from his enemies in a seemingly ordinary office. However, on closer inspection, there is something familiar about its layout.

                              <span>A new 40-minute Nintendo Direct presentation will be broadcast tomorrow, Tuesday 13th September, at 3pm UK time.


We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for an update from Nintendo on the company&#x27;s end of 2022 plans - as well as a sneak peek into 2023. Over the summer, we&#x27;ve heard various updates on new projects in a rather piecemeal fashion. And now the autumn&#x27;s first big launch - Splatoon 3 - has arrived. 


So, what do we expect? Well, the Direct is well-timed to coincide with Tokyo Games Show later this week, where third-party publishers will be in attendance to demo upcoming Switch games. We&#x27;re also hoping to hear more about Nintendo&#x27;s own plans. Rumours abound of an update on Zelda and Metroid.

                              <span>Forgive me, writers, but I could not recite a single lyric from the Metal: Hellsinger soundtrack. I want to say this is nothing personal - I can&#x27;t remember the lyrics to anything, being honest; maybe I&#x27;m just a bad listener - but actually, it is also a bit personal. This is just how metal works, how listening to metal works: a genre, like the classic music it&#x27;s always leant on, where each instrument has as much of a role in its storytelling and expression as a vocalist. To focus on one would be to miss the whole, enveloping gestalt of sound. You have to take it all in at once, to be both furiously dialled-in and totally zoned out, to enter the aural equivalent of a flow state. Or at least, this is what I would say if Mr. Hetfield ever quizzed me on why I can hum all eight-and-a-half minute…</span>

                              <span>Heartfelt, high-concept and the subject of much internet hysteria; there&#x27;s plenty that Forspoken has in common with its predecessor of sorts, with the development team behind Square Enix&#x27;s big-budget action RPG having been assembled from those who&#x27;d worked on Final Fantasy 15 - a game whose tortured development became legendary, but one that emerged hobbled yet highly entertaining. 


I&#x27;ve had a soft spot for Final Fantasy 15 ever since it came out, its abundance of character and sense of adventure atoning for some of its lumpiness, and despite a rough ride in recent weeks following its widely-derided trailer I&#x27;m developing a soft spot for Forspoken too. After spending just over an hour fleet-footing around the fantasy region of Avaolet, there&#x27;s that same free-wheeling sense of adventure that warmed me to Final Fantasy 15, backed up by an abundance of systems that promise some serious depth. 


Those similarities shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising, given that Forspoken is only the second game built upon the Luminous Engine that powered Final Fantasy 15. It shares the same stupendous scale of world to explore, with the same propensity for a beautiful wide-open vista - the area we had to play around with was full of diversions and mobs and sub-bosses to defeat, but perhaps the biggest distraction was the photo mode I kept turning to, capturing our hero Freya dancing across the fantasy landscape with her magic-infused parkour. If your idea of a good RPG is a stunning open space to explore with plenty of distractions along the way - as is mine - then Forspoken looks like it&#x27;ll deliver.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Forspoken has been doing the rounds for a while - the second game built on the Luminous Engine that made its debut with Final Fantasy 15, it was at the forefront of the PlayStation 5&#x27;s reveal when it was known as Project Athia and has had various public showings ahead of its release early next year, but perhaps its most impactful came after a trailer was posted on social media last month and was met with a rough response online, the dialogue becoming the butt of internet jokes.


&quot;It was unexpected to see the reactions to the social media post,&quot; Forspoken&#x27;s creative producer Raio Mitsuo told us after a recent opportunity to go hands-on with the game. &quot;Basically, we used existing footage from previous trailers and put something together as a social media post. And yeah, it went kind of viral in a way - that&#x27;s not the direction that we thought it was going to go! But I have to admit, some of the memes are actually pretty funny, so I got a good laugh out of it. 


&quot;But, you know, for us, it&#x27;s not something that we&#x27;re concerned with. We&#x27;re obviously leaving a lot of information on the table, because we&#x27;re taking dialogue and scenes out of context. Forspoken is a very narrative driven game. It&#x27;s a very story based game. We don&#x27;t want to ruin the experience in our marketing campaign. We&#x27;re being very selective about what to use to generate interest and sometimes without that information about what led up to that moment, or what was the character&#x27;s state of mind, we&#x27;re leaving the audience the full freedom to interpret lines in any way they want. It&#x27;s just one of those challenges that come naturally when trying to find ways to show the game without telling the full story, because we definitely don&#x27;t want to reveal that.&quot;

Well it&#x27;s not actually in a pub so I&#x27;m telling a bit of a fib - it&#x27;s at EGX in the ExCel Centre, on the live stage. All you have to do is turn up and you can use your mobile phone to join in. How fancy is that? No annoying sheets of paper to faff around with, no passing answers to the team next to you who will competitively mark you down. Just you and your friends having a nice sit down and a nice time.
And guess who your quizmaster is going to be? Why, it&#x27;s me! Silly old me.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 has had a hugely successful launch in Japan, with the highest domestic sales for any Switch game in the first three days.


Since launching on Friday, the game has sold 3.45m copies in Japan both physically and digitally.


It proves how popular the game is in Nintendo&#x27;s home market and how important the Splatoon IP is, outselling even Animal Crossing: New Horizons which had the previous best launch in Japan.

                              <span>Halfway through playing Cult of the Lamb I found myself engaged in a neat little dice-battling game. It was a mini-game, I guess, but it was so nicely handled, so rich in strategy and the suggestion of depth, that it felt like it could well have been spun off as a game in its own right. Call it the Gwent Impulse: inside this perfectly good game, here&#x27;s a smaller, also perfectly good game, seemingly included out of sheer generosity.


Since then I have been very lucky with regards to the Gwent Impulse. Is this a trend? I hope so.


When I say very lucky, I mean that I played two games over the weekend and they both turned out to have secondary games tucked within them. The first is Boneraiser Minions, a worryingly compelling auto-battler in the style of Vampire Survivors. You move around an arena summoning mobs who fight a horde of enemies for you. It all gets wilder and wilder as you unlock new mobs, new spells and all that jazz. Eventually the screen is filled with action and you can barely keep track of it. Beautiful!

                              <span>Fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been delayed more times than most games, although it’s finally pencilled in for a January release date. We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

It’s 23°c outside and folks are already thinking about PC gaming deals they might want in the damp, dark, dying days of November. Hey, I’m not knocking it, and I’ll even put together this guide that early Black Friday birds might find useful. I just don’t even think of what I want for dinner later.

                              <span>Japanese publishers Square Enix are taking more steps to implement the controversial blockchain technology in their games. Squenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys&#x27;s plans fits with Squenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

An ESRB 18+ rating that lists &quot;real gambling&quot; appears to be in effect for the upcoming back-to-basics Assassin’s Creed set in 9th century Baghdad. If you missed the first look at Mirage over the weekend then you can watch the cinematic trailer below.

                              <span>Following the reveal of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage over the weekend, fans noticed that the game&#x27;s rating suggests there will be real gambling, but Ubisoft has put out a statement assuring everyone it won&#x27;t.


At the time of writing, the official Xbox page for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage states that the game will be Adults Only 18+, and will include real gambling, which obviously raised some concerned eyebrows. In a statement to Eurogamer, Ubisoft has cleared the air on the situation, and promised there will be &quot;no real gambling or lootboxes,&quot; present in the game. 


&quot;Following the announcement of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage during Ubisoft Forward, some store pages mistakenly displayed the game for preorders with an Adults Only ESRB rating,&quot; a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer. &quot;While Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is still pending rating, Ubisoft wants to reassure players that no real gambling or lootboxes are present in the game.&quot;

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has announced its next game, Marvel World of Heroes, another mobile AR game planned to release in 2023.


There were a number of announcements at D23 this past weekend, which included a tease for Niantic&#x27;s next game, another AR game, this time bringing the Marvel Universe into the player&#x27;s hands. &quot;In Marvel World of Heroes, players can create their own unique Super Hero identity and origin story,&quot; reads the trailer&#x27;s description. Players will need to patrol their neighbourhoods to foil crimes, complete Super Hero missions, and thwart interdimensional threats.&quot;


The description also notes that as players level up, they can unlock equipment and abilities, and will be able to team up with heroes like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America, where they&#x27;ll face off against various villains in order to save the multiverse.

                              <span>Coming off the back of a Gamescom where Xbox mostly focused on well-known titles that’ll be out pretty soon, it looked like we’d be waiting quite a while for a further update on some of Xbox’s bigger and more mystery-shrouded upcoming games. Every now and then we get a little surprise, however – and such was the case with Perfect Dark, where Xbox’s Matt Booty briefly deigned to talk about the hotly-anticipated reboot during a PAX West panel.

Booty, who is the head of the now-sprawling Xbox Game Studios portfolio of development houses and games, talked about how any reboot of the Perfect Dark franchise would have to be handled “very carefully”, noting that properties such as this “don’t always age well.” And, you know, Booty is right. But the next thing he said is curious – and for my money, it’s wrong. 

“What I think is super cool about Perfect Dark, what’s super cool about Joanna Dark, is the super agent fantasy, the spy, the sort of Bourne Identity, James Bond kind of thing there,” Booty explained.

There&#x27;s been a lot of he-said, she-said, they-said this past week, with reports of the supposed Direct airing this week, then getting delayed, then not getting delayed, and now finally it&#x27;s confirmed that it will be streamed on the official Nintendo YouTube channel at 3pm BST/ 4pm CEST/ 10am EST.


The Direct will apparently feature &quot;roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching this winter.&quot; Seeing as winter runs from December to March, don&#x27;t expect everything that is shown off to be coming out in just December.

                              <span>If you’re one of the very online malcontents that’s constantly droning on about difficulty in games, eyes up – this one’s for you. Metal: Hellsinger, when played properly, is a tricky game with a steep learning curve, and it has no qualms about throwing you into the mosh pit and knocking you down until you can barely get back up. Even the first level will embarrass you deeply if you’ve got no sense of timing and rhythm. To succeed in Hell, you need to keep time. 

This is nothing new, of course: BPM: Bullets Per Minute, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Cadence of Hyrule, and Before the Echo have been popularisiing the genre somewhat over the last few years – giving those of us who like to bob our heads and nod in time to indiscriminate video game murder plenty to chew on. But few games do it all as well as Metal: Hellsinger.
Even if you don’t like metal, there’s value here. As a game, there’s a sense of flow you can easily activate listening to the blast beats of 4/4 and pulling off your slick maneuvers, empowering you and making you really feel like an indestructible master of war. Even better, if you keep your multiplier high by doing everything in time with the beat and going off-time, you ‘earn’ the vocal tracks with some high-profile industry names.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is doing incredibly well in Japan, so well in fact it is now the fastest selling game in the country. 


Earlier today (September 12), Nintendo Japan shared that Splatoon 3 has sold more than 3.45 million copies in its first three days of sale, made up of both physical and digital copies. To put things into perspective, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, one of Nintendo&#x27;s best selling games, sold 1.88 million copies in the same time frame. Meaning Splatoon 3 has sold almost double that of New Horizons.


But as industry analyst Daniel Ahmad points out, it isn&#x27;t just the best launch for a Switch game in Japan, it&#x27;s the best launch for any game in Japan. The previous record holder was Pokémon Black and White, which sold more than 2.6 million copies in its first two days on sale, and only selling a touch more than that in its first week. Which still puts Splatoon 3 ahead just by just under a million.

                              <span>Right. We all know Forspoken as the game that’s been perpetually delayed, that’s been laughed at for its dumb trailers, and that’s been sort-of left out to die. That’s a fair comment, right? A cursory look at any of the popular gaming message boards, or at social media, will instantly tell you that Forspoken is no-one’s most anticipated game. It’s a curio, at best. A game people are gleefully watching, expecting it to fail, at worst. 

But what if I told you that, actually, it’s not that bad? That – when you get your hands on it – it actually feels OK to play? Playing as Frey, the young black woman spirited away from New York and dumped in the land of Athia, you are tasked with helping the people of a dying land in order to get back home. It’s Wizard of Oz via all the JRPG tropes you’d expect from the studio that made Final Fantasy 15. 
The core conceit is your use of magic. A sentient cuff has bound itself to you, and acts as your mentor-cum-friend in these strange new worlds. It also chats shit, constantly, but the incessant banter really isn’t as bad as you’ve been led to believe from all the memes and dodgy trailers. In context, it’s actually – whisper it – quite charming. No worse than what you’ve endured in Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands 3, or Tales from the Borderlands, Battleborn, Tiny Tina’s… you get the picture.

                              <span>Forspoken went viral in August. But probably not for the reason the developers and publishers at Square Enix would have wanted. A video was released on the game’s social media account that immediately caught the ire of the internet’s biggest meme-lords. Pastiches riffing on the game’s dialogue ran the gamut – there was God of War, Yakuza, Doom, Devil May Cry, and some people even said it came off like a Joss Whedon joint (ouch).

But, stay with me here, the game isn’t actually that bad in your hands. Really. I had over an hour to preview the title at Square Enix’s offices recently, and whilst the dialogue is a little try-hard, it’s not that bad. It’s one of those things; a trailer cannot accurately convey how a game will play out in your hands – the timing is off, the editing is wrong, there’s no context.

“I&#x27;m so happy you mentioned the word ‘context’ here,” says Forspoken creative producer, Raio Mitsuno, in a follow-up interview after our preview. “That’s been the the key thing for us in terms of how we&#x27;re trying to show fun things about this game without spoiling the story. [The trailers and social media posts] obviously come without the context that&#x27;s necessary to really understand it, and really get a feel for it.”

                              <span>Revealed at The Disney and Marvel Games Showcase, Gargoyles will be privy to a remaster way over 10 years since it first released on the SEGA Genesis.
Gargoyles, which was first released back in 1995, is a video game adaptation of the animated series of the same name. Both the series and the game didn’t reach the same popularity as other Disney classics at the time, like The Lion King and Aladdin, but it’s still a game that awakes a warm feeling of nostalgia for many.
It’s a classic platformer through and through, that honestly looks great as is still, so it’ll be interesting to see just what Empty Clip do with the remaster. As of right now, all we know is to expect updated visuals and controls.

Almost two years after the previous Norwegian Bokmål translation of
the &quot;The Debian Administrator&#x27;s
Handbook&quot; was published, a new edition is finally being prepared.  The
english text is updated, and it is time to start working on the
translations.  Around 37 percent of the strings have been updated, one
way or another, and the translations starting from a complete Debian Buster
edition now need to bring their translation up from 63% to 100%.  The
complete book is licensed using a Creative Commons license, and has
been published in several languages over the years.  The translations
are done by volunteers to bring Linux in their native tongue.  The
last time I checked, it complete text was available in English,
Norwegian Bokmål, German, Indonesian, Brazil Portuguese and Spanish.
In addition, work has been started for Arabic (Morocco), Catalan,
Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish,
Dutch, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Polish,
Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish and Vietnamese.
The translation is conducted on
the
hosted weblate project page.  Prospective translators are
recommeded to subscribe to
the
translators mailing list and should also check out
the instructions for
contributors.
I am one of the Norwegian Bokmål translators of this book, and we
have just started.  Your contribution is most welcome.

That was over a decade ago and then it became largely a virtual event and then faded away in favor of Canonical&#x27;s internal road-map planning and other developer sprints among their employees. Coming up in November in Prague is the return of an in-person official event with the Ubuntu Summit...</span>

                              <span>Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra and scientific computing. It aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use, has a syntax deliberately close to Matlab, and is useful for algorithm development directly in C++, or quick conversion of research code into production environments. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 1016 packages other packages on CRAN, downloaded 26.2 million times (per the partial logs from the cloud mirrors of CRAN), and the CSDA paper (preprint / vignette) by Conrad and myself has been cited 493 times according to Google Scholar.

I have been reading books, both fiction and non-fiction for a long long time. My first book was a comic most probably when I was down with Malaria when I was a kid. I must be around 4-5 years old. Over the years, books have given me great joy and I continue to find nuggets of useful information, both in fiction as well as non-fiction books. So here’s to sharing something and how that can lead you to a rabbit hole. This entry would be a bit NSFW as far as language is concerned. 
NYPD Red 5 by James Patterson – First of all, have no clue as to why James Patterson’s popularity has been falling. He used to be right there with Lee Child and others, but not so much now. While I try to be mysterious about books, I would give a bit of heads-up so people know what to expect. This is probab…</span>

Hogfather is the 20th Discworld novel and not a very good place to
start.  I recommend at least reading Soul
Music first for a proper introduction to Susan, and you may want to
start with Mort.



When we last saw Susan, she was a student at the Quirm College for Young
Ladies.  Now she&#x27;s a governess for two adorable youngsters, a job that
includes telling them stories and dealing quite capably with monsters in
the cellar.  (She uses a poker.)  It also includes answering questions
like whether the Hogfather really exists or whether the presents just come
from your parent…</span>

                              <span>As part of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, Ubisoft has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its upcoming The Division game, The Division Heartland.

A standalone, free-to-play addition to the The Division series, Heartland is a survival-action multiplayer shooter &quot;set in small-town America within the Division universe&quot;. While initially it was expected to release in &quot;2021-22&quot;, we&#x27;re now looking at 2022-2023 on PC, consoles, and cloud.

&quot;This standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C.,&quot; Ubisoft explains, confirming that Red Storm – a &quot;veteran team who has worked on the franchise since the first The Division game&quot; – is developing the shooter.

As just one of the many announcements to have come out of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward, Ubisoft is offering players the chance to &quot;play your favourite franchises, challenge yourself and your friends or create new worlds on PC with Ubisoft+, including new releases on day one and premium editions DLC&quot;.

There are two tiers; you can either limit your access to PC, where you get 30 days to try its library, premium editions, and 100+ games, or you can go for &quot;multi access&quot; which offers the same but also the option to play on Google Stadia via cloud gaming, too.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has refuted claims that its game has been further delayed after Xbox began issuing refunds for pre-orders. 

Earlier this week, those who pre-ordered Stalker 2 began receiving messages informing them that their orders had been cancelled due to the fact that Stalker 2&#x27;s release date has been pushed back to an &quot;unconfirmed date in the future&quot;. At the same time, the pre-order option on the Xbox store was disabled.

Following Putin&#x27;s illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine, the studio&#x27;s home, GSC Game World initially put Stalker 2&#x27;s development on hold, picking it up again once the studio was later relocated to Prague. Though originally slated to release in April this year, it was pushed to the first half of 2023 and the fact there&#x27;s no solid date is reportedly why Xbox is offering refunds.

From launch, the pros available include, in PGA Tour 2K23&#x27;s ordering: Tiger Woods, Justin Thomas, Lexi Thompson, Lydia Ko, Brooke Henderson, Will Zalatoris, Collin Morikawa, Tony Finau, Jon Rahm, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele, and &quot;more&quot;.

&quot;Each pro is decked out in true-to-life attire and gear, and features a unique set of attributes representative of their skill set,&quot; 2K says. &quot;Players can step into the tee box as one of the pros in Exhibition, Multiplayer and Divot Derby play, or go head-to-head with them in a battle to climb the leaderboard and claim the FedExCup in PGA Tour MyCareer mode.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been six months since the release of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s 1.5 update - the milestone patch that finally added native support for current generation consoles. CD Projekt RED has not been idle though, the new 1.6 &#x27;Edgerunners&#x27; update arrived last week, tying in with the new anime. A raft of new content features are added, but the focus of this piece is on a brand-new Xbox Series S performance mode, along with optimisations to the 30fps ray tracing mode on PS5 and Series X, where long-standing complaints about high input lag are finally addressed. Going into this one, we had two separate objectives - to put Series S&#x27;s new 60 frames per second mode through its paces and also to quantify the latency improvements on the more powerful consoles. 
Until the arrival of the new patch, Series S only ran at a capped 30fps at a dynamic 1440p resolution, going down to 2304x1296 lowest via dynamic scaling. There was no mode toggle like on PS5 or Series X - no option to choose between quality and performance. Adding to the disappointment, Series S had no option for ray-traced shadows either. Patch 1.6 doesn&#x27;t add the RT features, but at least the option to switch between fidelity and frame-rate is there.
Quality mode on Series S today works pretty much just as it did before the patch, in its default mode: it runs the gamut from 1440p down to around 1296p, with a reasonably tight 30fps lock with consistent frame-pacing. The new performance mode - inevitably - degrades some settings. In terms of pixel metrics, we&#x27;re looking at a range of 1080p at peak, going down to 800p lowest, most obvious in the areas where the game can&#x27;t stick to its 60fps target. As ever, CDPR&#x27;s engine also uses a form of TAA and reconstruction to produce a final 1080p resolve.

                              <span>Disney has confirmed that the next game to be plucked from the archives and given the remaster treatment will be Gargoyles.

As confirmed at The Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, Empty Clip will be taking on the 27-year-old platformer and updating it to join &quot;revived classics like The Jungle Book, Aladdin, and The Lion King&quot; with &quot;updated visuals and controls&quot; and will be coming to unspecified &quot;modern consoles&quot; and PC.

Described as a &quot;fan-favourite that&#x27;s sure to have you screaming like a Viking yeeted by Goliath&quot;, Disney was keen to stress that we &quot;have to wait to climb back into the world of Gargoyles Remastered&quot;, so we probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it any time soon (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Ubisoft is now inviting players to sign up and try the &quot;early version&quot; beta test of Rainbow Six Mobile.

Whilst keen to stress that the mobile devices in &quot;this test do not represent the final list of devices for launch&quot; and that &quot;content and quality of the game are still a work-in-progress&quot;, the developer/publisher says a closed beta will go live tomorrow, 12th September, in select countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Singapore, and India.

Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t look like any Europeans or players with Apple devices can get involved just yet.

Subtitled The Last Chapter – because, of course, it&#x27;s the last chapter – Valhalla&#x27;s final expansion is expected to launch &quot;in a few months time&quot; and sees Eivor &quot;say goodbye&quot; to their people and set forth for &quot;distant shores and new adventures&quot;. 

The free quest arc will &quot;nicely tie up some of the storylines established throughout the game&quot; and see Eivor reunite with some key characters... &quot;including some influential historical ones&quot;, according to Ubisoft.

You might&#x27;ve seen our takes on the more big-and-obvious fare, from demos of Creative Assembly&#x27;s new thing Hyenas and Glen Schofield&#x27;s Dead Space-alike The Callisto Protocol, to a nice chat with Sonic boss Takashi Iizuka and hands on with Sonic Frontiers, a bit of time with Obsidian&#x27;s darkly brilliant Pentiment, and a look at Warhammer 40K: Darktide&#x27;s meaty gunplay. 


But! There are more games than just these big, obvious ones coming soon, and they very much deserve your attention, so here&#x27;s a rundown of all the other clever, inventive, or just generally interesting curios that impressed us from the show.

First revealed back in June, Aliens: Dark Descent is a new single-player action game set to launch in 2023 from Tindalos Interactive and Focus Entertainment, but no gameplay was shown at the time. Now, although only briefly, we&#x27;ve had our first look at the squad-based shooter in action.


The trailer shows the top-down game in action, where you &quot;take your squad of marines on missions as you infiltrate and investigate the Xenomorph outbreak. Develop your tactics, assemble your colonial marines, and take on the Xenomorph hordes.&quot;

                              <span>Castlevania&#x27;s Simon Belmont and Alucard are coming to platform fighter Brawlhalla this October, &quot;just in time for Halloween.&quot;


The latest guest characters to join the Smash Bros-esque Brawlhalla are vampire hunter and vampire Simon Belmont and Alucard respectively, and are set to arrive October 19 as part of the new Brawhalla-vania event. The guest characters were revealed as part of the Ubisoft Forward digital conference, and is obviously in collaboration with Konami.


The two were revealed as part of a very nicely done 2D animated trailer, interspersed with some gameplay of the two. Both of their designs are pretty faithful looking to their original looks, though with a bobble-head-like quality to them. Simon uses his classic axe, flail, and more to fend off enemies, with a moveset that does look unique compared to his Smash Bros. Ultimate counterpart.

                              <span>That mysterious Nier: Automata church that ended up being a genuinely impressive mod is now available for everyone to download, so get your praying knees ready.


Back in July the internet was abuzz with this strange situation where it looked like an entire, previously undiscovered area of Nier: Automata had been found by just some random person on Reddit. But as it turns out, it was actually a bit of a hoax organised by a group of individuals who had made some highly impressive mod tools that many thought weren&#x27;t possible just yet. And now, you can download it yourself to live out the surreal story yourself.


You can download the mod on popular modding site Nexusmods, with a very tongue-in-cheek description that reads, &quot;Hello, i&#x27;m new to reddit and want to know how to open the church in Nier&#x27;Automata.&quot; It is noted that there are some recommendations for installing the mod, so make sure to check them out if you are interested in trying the mod out.

                              <span>Sega has announced RGG Summit 2022, a livestream entirely focused on Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.


The stream will take place next week, September 14, at 11am BST/ 12pm CEST/ 6am EST, and is set to air on the official Sega Twitch channel. RGG Studio didn&#x27;t mention any specifics about what we can expect during the livestream in the announcement tweet, it&#x27;s probably pretty safe to say that Yakuza 8 will make some kind of appearance during the show. 

Back in July we received our first look at Yakuza 8, which was mostly just a few screenshots. But based on said screenshots, we could see that it will be a direct sequel to Yakuza: Like A Dragon, with that game&#x27;s protagonist Ichiban set to return. We do know that Yakuza should be staying as a turn-based RPG series, as the game&#x27;s creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer Kazuki Hosokawa said as much after the success of Like A Dragon.

                              <span>The EA published The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth has received its first gameplay trailer, showing off the turn-based, mobile game in action.
First announced back in May, Heroes of Middle-earth was revealed as a character-collecting RPG, but no gameplay was shown at the time, just a single piece of concept art. Now, as revealed at GameSpot Swipe, the game has finally been shown in action, with the game&#x27;s art director Chris Salazar going into some detail.
Interestingly there is a new ring that&#x27;s been added to the universe, which according to Salazar, &quot;grants the player the ability to bring the best characters that best suite that battle that&#x27;s going to happen in that location, and somewhat push the bounds of what is the narrative canon.&quot; Salazar also explained that the new ring will make a lot more sense once you dive into the game.

                              <span>The latest patch for MultiVersus is here, bringing along a reworked hitbox and hurtbox, swapping out Velma calling a police car for the Mystery Machine, and adds in Gizmo.
Multiverse patch 1.02 is here, and has some pretty big changes for the game, the biggest being the hitbox/ hurtbox overhaul. Before the update, character&#x27;s hurtboxes were just a single, bean-like shape, more of a one-size-fits-all kind of situation. Now though, hurtboxes wrap around each character individually, which should make the action a bit tighter. 
The latest update also brings in a brand-new character, Gizmo, the kind-hearted Mogwai from the best Christmas movie around, Gremlins. Gizmo is a support character that can help teammates absorb incoming damage. His classic pink car can be used as a projectile to shoot enemies from afar, and can use an umbrella to either float to safety or ram into his opponents.

Obviously, if you don&#x27;t want to know anything about this unconfirmed hero before they&#x27;re officially revealed, stop reading here, but if you&#x27;re not fussed, be our guest!
So far, Overwatch 2 has two new characters confirmed to be coming to the game, who was also accidentally revealed through a leak, and Junker Queen, who managed to avoid the leak treatment. Unfortunately for Kiriko, the name of the the newest spirit-fox-themed hero, her reveal comes through another leak, this time of an animated short, though it&#x27;s not quite finished.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley just launched, but the promise of new content is already on the horizon with the announcement of a Toy Story realm.
It&#x27;s D23 at the moment, the Disney event that announces a big range of upcoming films, TV shows, merch, and games owned by the media conglomerate. Considering Disney Dreamlight Valley literally only launched this week it&#x27;s a bit of a surprise that new content has already been announced, but either way, there&#x27;s a Toy Story realm coming to the game this autumn. 
A trailer was released showing off the realm in action, which unsurprisingly is set in a kids room, though doesn&#x27;t appear to be Andy&#x27;s room specifically, with your player character shrunk down to get a toy&#x27;s perspective. The trailer revealed a couple of new outfits that your character will be able to wear, one an obviously Woody-themed cowperson outfit, the other themed Buzz that sort of looks like something you&#x27;d wear in your downtime at Space Command.

                              <span>Tekken is a massively popular series: the latest game in the series bypassing 9 million sales in its lifetime is proof enough of that. But as popular as the series is today, there’s something about the early games in the fighting game franchise – Tekken 2 and Tekken 3, specifically – that left their mark in the cultural consciousness in an altogether different way.

For lots of people, their first exposure to Bandai Namco’s 3D fighter was in Tekken 2 – but thanks to Demo One discs and the proliferation of Platinum games on the original PlayStation, I’d wager more people eventually got their hands on (and spent more time with) Tekken 3. And rightly so; it was argueably better than Tekken 2 in every way – and there’s something about the style, the music, the story, and the whole aesthetic that just belongs so wholly in the 90s. It’s become more than a game; it’s become a vessel for nostalgia. 
It’s fitting, then, that Netflix’s latest video game adaptation revolves mostly around Tekken 3. Tekken: Bloodline’s story takes us back to just before the third King of Iron Fist Tournament; we see a young Jin Kazama being taught by his mother, Jun, to channel his rage and power – and only use his martial arts prowess for good. Tragedy befalls the family, and Jin is instructed to seek out his paternal grandfather: Heihachi Mishima. One of the richest, and most evil, men in Japan.

During the showcase, the Skull and Bones team also revealed a bit more about smuggling networks. These become available to you once you&#x27;ve earned enough infamy and unlocked your pirate lair, known as The Helm. This will be the base of your smuggling operations.

                              <span>Valve have opened repair centres for the Steam Deck. These are where you&#x27;ll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it&#x27;s still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it&#x27;s not. &quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; say Valve.

                              <span>Before announcing a bazillion Assassin&#x27;s Creed games during tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward stream, the publisher did first show a handful of other games. Among them was a first look at The Division: Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off from the Clancyverse shooter, which was described as an &quot;action survival shooter.&quot; You can watch it below.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

                              <span>A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin&#x27;s Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway!

                              <span>&quot;History can help us better understand the world we live in,&quot; said Ubisoft during its Ubisoft Forward presentation, where we learned an awful lot about the future of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise. &quot;So many elements from the past resonate with our present.&quot; It&#x27;s a pretty big nod to the current state of world affairs, and the developer notes that it doesn&#x27;t want to stop making games about the past to help us better understand our future.
To that end, the publisher shared more details on its mysterious Infinty project. Back in Summer 2021, Ubisoft officially confirmed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity to be in development at its Montreal, and Quebec studios. Since we learned about the project, we&#x27;ve heard precious little about it – until today. 
During the showcase, staff from Ubisoft noted that Project Infinity “is not a game” per se; instead, it’s a single entry point for fans, that will act as something as a springboard into the future. It’s a hub, then, &quot;like a real-life animus&quot; per the developer – a place that unifies stories and experiences in one place. It sounds a little bit like a launcher to me, but we&#x27;ll see.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve probably played something by Clint Hocking: he&#x27;s a massive name in games, and has been attached to some of the largest games in Ubisoft&#x27;s history. The Canadian video game designer and director wrote Spliter Cell, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and Far Cry 2. He was also creative director on Watch Dogs Legion, and is co-creative director alongside Jonathan Dumont on the upcoming Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity..
He also coined the term &#x27;ludonarrative dissonance&#x27; back in 2007, too, so you&#x27;ve got him to thank for that one.
Why the history lesson? Well, at Ubisoft Forward, the French publisher noted that Hocking will be heading up a brand new game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe: Codename Hexe. The teaser basically makes it look like Assassin’s Creed: Blair Witch – there&#x27;s deep dark woods, a spooky wooden Assassin&#x27;s Creed symbol, and the promise of mystery.

                              <span>As well as announcing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, during tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, Ubisoft has also announced a brand-new game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe that will finally take us on a historic tour of Japan: Codename Red.
We&#x27;ve only got a very brief teaser for the game at the time of writing, and the title is still a while off yet (the next game in the series will be the aforementioned Mirage), but hey – at least we know it&#x27;s coming.
Ubisoft refers to this title as &quot;The future of our open world flagship RPG series&quot;, which seems to reference the fact that Mirage will be a more &#x27;classic&#x27; Assassin&#x27;s experience that leans on stealth and parkour more than it does damage numbers and massive worlds.

                              <span>It&#x27;s one of the year&#x27;s worst-kept gaming secrets, but at least now we know that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real. After leaks, a formal tease from Ubisoft, and a report that listed the game alongside a slew of other titles, Ubisoft has finally announced the next step in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe at Ubisoft Forward.
&quot;In Assassin’s Creed Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice,&quot; reads a blurb for the game. &quot;After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.&quot;
The new game will focus on one of the secondary characters we saw in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla – the Middle Eastern member of the order, Basim Ibn Ishaq. The game will take place some 20 years before the events of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and offer a more classic Assassin’s Creed experience. Ergo, it won&#x27;t be so similar to the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins, Odyssey, or Valhalla.

This is according to the Epic Games Store which listed the date on the game&#x27;s store page through the &quot;Pre-Purchase Bonus” section (thanks, Gematsu).
According to the page, which has since removed the information and now has it listed as &quot;coming soon,&quot; the pre-purchase bonus is a Fortnite glider resembling Sully’s seaplane. The glider is to be made available immediately upon pre-purchase, or you can wait until November 17 after it hits the Fortnite shop.

Ubisoft has promised to announce updates on upcoming games like Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Skull and Bones, as well as a special Assassin’s Creed showcase offering a peek at the future of the franchise.

Whatever you decide to do, be sure to take some time and be like us by playing some games. Because, like, you know, we&#x27;re cool and stuff.
This weekend, we&#x27;re going a little cyberpunk, getting scared by T-800s, and traveling to a galaxy far, far away.

Speaking this week in Paris, Assassin&#x27;s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté revealed a presentation slide for Invictus full of artwork showing past Assassin&#x27;s Creed protagonists, as well as enemies such as Odyssey&#x27;s minotaur. 


&quot;Codename Invictus is being designed to be a standalone game on the Infinity hub, alongside Codename Red and Codename Hexe,&quot; Coté announced.

                              <span>Ubisoft has laid down a roadmap for the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, featuring two major new games coming beyond 2023&#x27;s Baghdad-set Mirage.


Set in feudal Japan, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Project Red will arrive at some point after 2023. It&#x27;s described as an open-world RPG, a chance for fans to live out their powerful shinobi fantasy, and is in development by the talented Quebec-based team behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


Sometime after that, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Project Hexe will be next to launch. Details are extremely thin, but it looks to be a mysterious, witchcraft-inspired entry, and is being worked on by the Valhalla team at Ubisoft Montreal.

                              <span>Speaking to Eurogamer this week at Ubisoft&#x27;s headquarters in Paris, Assassin&#x27;s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has exenstively detailed what the franchise&#x27;s mysterious new Infinity platform will look like, and offer fans.
Infinity appears to be the brainchild of Coté, whose new role as head of Ubisoft&#x27;s biggest franchise sees him looking to revamp the series into a series of blockbuster single-player games, a standalone multiplayer portion and smaller free experiences for fans - all of which will be accessible from Infinity. 
The platform will also serve as the new, dedicated home to Assassin&#x27;s Creed&#x27;s modern day story, which will progress separately to upcoming games Codename Red, set in feudal Japan, and Codename Hexe, which looks to be set in 16th century Europe.

Jade will be set in ancient China, and let you parkour all over the country&#x27;s Great Wall as a player-created character. (So, no, you&#x27;re not playing as fan-favourite Shao Jun. But perhaps she&#x27;ll appear?)

Numerous reports of sexual misconduct sparked a round of departures from the company, but Ubisoft has remained under pressure ever since - and even this week - from staff who feel the publisher has not done enough. 


On Thursday, in Paris, at a briefing attended by Eurogamer, Guillemot described the moment as a &quot;stumble&quot; which the company had since acknowledged and learned from.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward event has revealed a first glimpse at Mirage, next year&#x27;s new Assassin&#x27;s Creed adventure - although we&#x27;re still waiting for a look at gameplay, and there&#x27;s still no firmer release date than &quot;2023&quot;. 

Still, we now know much more about Mirage than we did through this year&#x27;s drip-feed of leaks from around the internet - and from Ubisoft itself. And this week, I sat down with several of the game&#x27;s Bordeaux-based development team for a deeper dive into what was shown publicly today. Read on for details of djinn, a popular rumour seemingly being denied, and more details on that Prince of Persia crossover.

Mirage is set in Baghdad and begins in the year 861, when the city enjoyed a golden age where it was a commercial and cultural crossroads. It was home to all manner of faces from all parts of the known world - a perfect cast for an Assassin&#x27;s Creed game - and also, of course, future Master Assassin himself, Basim Ibn Ishaq. When the game begins, we meet Basim several decades before his journey to England and arrival in the story of 2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. Here, on the streets of Baghdad, Basim begins as a petty thief, who catches the eye of the Hidden Ones.

                              <span>Join us tonight to watch Ubisoft Forward, a showcase of announcements from the publisher behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed, The Division, Just Dance and Mario + Rabbids. 


We&#x27;d expect to see all of those franchises represented this evening, when the livestream begins at 8pm UK time. There&#x27;s also a pre-show event for keen beans, beginning at 7.35pm UK time.


Ubisoft has promised this show will reveal the &quot;future&quot; of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, beginning with next year&#x27;s Baghdad-set stealth game Mirage. But we&#x27;re hoping and expecting much more as well - including a look, and hopefully some concrete details, on the company&#x27;s ambitious-sounding Infinity platform for the future of the franchise.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley has revealed an all-new Toy Story realm.

Showcased at the recent Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, the realm looks exactly as you just may expect, including a recreation of Andy&#x27;s bedroom where you&#x27;ll get to hang out with your favourite Toy Story characters.

Admittedly, we didn&#x27;t learn much else - the trailer doesn&#x27;t even last two minutes and the description simply says &quot;discover the brand-new Toy Story adventure coming this fall in Dreamlight Valley&quot; – but we did learned that you&#x27;ll be able to partner up with &quot;Woody and Buzz&quot; for a &quot;brand-new Toy Story adventure&quot; where you&#x27;ll also be able to bring your friends from other Disney valleys, too.

Valve says that should you &quot;encounter an issue&quot; with its new handheld system, you can send your Steam Deck for repair or replacement via one of its repair centres, where the team will &quot;diagnose the device, repair if needed, then ship the fixed unit back to you&quot;.

Whilst in-warranty repairs will be carried out free of charge, Valve does remind players that &quot;if your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty&quot;, although repair centres will repair accidental damage &quot;for a fee&quot;. Otherwise, Steam Deck owners are invited to &quot;fix things yourself&quot; with repair kits, replacement parts, and guides all available at iFixit.

The new 2D adventure has been built upon a cancelled 2016 project by Dlala Studios and will feature Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, and Goofy, inspired by the Mickey Mouse cartoon shorts. You can check it out in the trailer below:

&quot;Join Mickey &amp; Friends on a quest to save a mysterious world from disaster!&quot; teases the game&#x27;s description on YouTube. &quot;In this brand-new 1-4 player cooperative adventure platformer, you’ll navigate as Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy through a beautifully hand-crafted world as you run, swim, swing, and jump to recover three magical books to save the world.&quot;

Though the store page was almost instantly pulled down and amended, it wasn&#x27;t quick enough to fool the internet, which managed to catch a proposed release date of 19th October, 2022.

Looks like there&#x27;ll be a Fortnite-flavoured pre-order bonus, too; a &quot;snazzy new Fortnite glider in the shape of Sully&#x27;s seaplane&quot;.

&quot;Players will also enjoy a more immersive and realistic NBA gameplay experience with commentary from NBA play-by-play announcers and colour analysts, such as Kevin Harlan, Brian Anderson, Greg Anthony, Grant Hill, and Doris Burke for the first time,&quot; the developer says.

With an all-new rocket pass – this one headlined by the Honda Civic Type R, the first &quot;IRL car in Rocket Pass&quot; – and the new grassy Sovereign Heights Arena, you&#x27;ll be able to &quot;take it outside&quot; given its &quot;blanketed in artisanal turf crafted by the neighborhood co-op&quot;. 

&quot;Inspired by the famously hot hatchback, this in-game Honda Civic Type R is the first-ever IRL car to come included in Rocket Pass Premium! The JDM masterpiece hits the streets with a beloved spec: Octane Hitbox,&quot; developer Psyonix explains.

                              <span>It feels real good to shoot stuff in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. This might not sound like the biggest deal - it&#x27;s always important for this type of horde-based, zombie-mowing game - but for Darktide good shooting is significant. Developer Fatshark, who previously made spiritual, franchise-adjacent predecessors Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, hadn&#x27;t used actual FPS mechanics before, with Vermintide almost entirely based on melee. And doing it right in Darktide, it turns out, has been a challenge.


&quot;It&#x27;s been tricky,&quot; says Mats Andersson, lead combat designer at Fatshark, who was speaking to us at Gamescom. He explains it&#x27;s something they had to build up to step-by-step, in part because of the game&#x27;s hybrid approach that mixes both melee and first-person shooting. &quot;We knew that we wanted to do a hybrid kind of thing,&quot; he said, &quot;as we wanted to keep the melee part, because we wanted to extend it, rather than have a completely separate game mode with ranged combat.&quot;


Originally Darktide had what Andersson called &quot;simple ADS,&quot; where holding aim will simply bring a ranged weapon up to the middle of the screen to give you that &quot;aim down sights&quot; perspective, like it would in most FPS games. But Andersson described the result, &quot;if you just have a static animation with some spread on it,&quot; as &quot;less than stellar.&quot; The big push, therefore, has been to &quot;up the quality of that, and doing some more finicky and sophisticated things with recoil and spread, the swaying animation blend sets, lining everything up so it&#x27;s so controlled that the gun lines up and shoots where it needs to shoot.&quot;

                              <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is getting a new Galactic Edition on 1st November that&#x27;ll include the base game and a total of 13 Character Packs.


To date, developer TT Games has graced The Skywalker Saga with seven DLC Character Packs - Solo, Rogue One, The Bad Batch, Trooper, The Mandalorian&#x27;s first and second seasons, plus a Classic Character Pack - pushing the game&#x27;s playable character roster well over the 400 mark.


Come the release of November&#x27;s Galactic Edition, however, that line-up will be expanded further with characters including Cassian Andor, Captain Rex, and Reva. These will arrive as part of six new Character Packs, named as The Clone Wars, The Book of Boba Fett, Rebels, Summer Vacation, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Andor.

                              <span>In June I caved and bought a Prusa
Mini
3D printer for home. I bought it just before an announced price hike. I went
for a Prusa because of their reputation for &quot;just working&quot;, and the Mini mostly
as its the cheapest, although, the print area (7&quot;³) is large enough for most of
the things I am likely to print.






To get started, at the same time I bought some Prusament recycled
PLA to print
with which, unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed with.
I was attracted to the idea of buying a recycled material and Prusa make a lot
about the quality of their filaments.
The description was pretty clear that the colour would be somewhat random and
vary throughout the spool, but I didn&#x27;t mind that, and I planned to use it for
mainly functional prints where the precise colour didn&#x27;t matter. The colour
examples from the product page were mostly off-white grey with some tint,
typically green. There are not a lot of reviews of the recycled PLA that
comment on the colour of their spools, but in a couple of youtube videos
(1,
2) the spools have looked a
grey-ish silver, sometimes with a greenish tint, pretty similar to the product
page.
The colour I got is quite unlike those: it&#x27;s a dull brown, with little flecks

Black.
That&#x27;s totally within &quot;spec&quot;, of course, but it&#x27;s a bit boring.

                              <span>And I&#x27;m over here with the Debian images/media release team in Cambridge.
First time together in Cambridge for a long time: several of the usual suspects - RattusRattus, Sledge, Isy and myself. Also in the room are Kartik and egw - I think this is their first time.
Chat is now physically in Sledge&#x27;s sitting room as well as on IRC. The first couple of images are trickling in and tests are starting for Bullseye.

This is going to be a very long day - we&#x27;ve got full tests for Bullseye (Debian 11) and Buster (Debian 10) so double duty. This should be the last release for Buster since this has now passed to LTS.</span>

So I&#x27;m in Berlin currently to attend the fourth Qubes OS Summit, also to discuss the future of the reproducible-builds.org mirror of snapshot.debian.org and in the evening I&#x27;ve met an old Debian friend who told a lovely story about his 5 year old daughter, who since recently is a Debian user using an old laptop with LUKS encryption, knowing her data will be lost when she forgets her passphrase... 😀
The Qubes OS Summit is also very cool, great people and exciting developments!</span>

                              <span>A week ago I wrote about the rec-def Haskell library, which allows you to write more recursive definitions, such as in this small example:
let s1 &#x3D; rInsert 23 s2
    s2 &#x3D; rInsert 42 s1
in getR s1
This will not loop (as it would if you’d just used Data.Set), but rather correctly return the set S.fromList [23,42]. See the previous blog post for more examples and discussion of the user-facing side of this.
For quick reference, these are the types of the functions involved here:
rInsert :: a -&gt; R (Set a) -&gt; R (Set a)
getR :: R (Set a) -&gt; Set a

The type of s1 and s2 above is not Set Int, but rather R (Set Int), and in this post I’ll explain how R works internally.

Who make games like they&#x27;re films
Always should be something you really love
You couldn&#x27;t go anywhere in 1994 without Blur&#x27;s classic, Games and Films, wriggling through the airwaves and into your ears. No other song captured the mood of the era better. Video games were rising, but wanted to get the credibility of films, while films were looking at the growing success of games and wondering if they should be keeping an eye on them. Games with bits of movies in them were the result. A lot of them were naff, but we still enjoyed them.
The school playgrounds at the time became battlegrounds. The &quot;filmers&quot; of the time insisted that films are art and shouldn&#x27;t be disrespected by these new &quot;computer games,&quot; which to be fair was a common view of children up and down the country, likely the world, who had deep admiration for classic movies like Baby&#x27;s Day Out and Problem Child. A fringe group, though, calling themselves &quot;gamers,&quot; stood up for their exciting new hobby. Games didn&#x27;t have to be art. They could be anything they wanted to be.

                              <span>Evil West is a game you&#x27;re going to be hearing about a lot in the coming months, some might even say it could be your favourite action game of 2022. The Flying Wild Hog third-person shooter-meets-action-game dropped a lengthy new gameplay trailer.
This is the the second one of those we got to see this summer, and it looks even better. Though the focus remains squarely on the action, this new footage does offer a deeper dive into the narrative and a look at some of the characters.
Evil West takes place in an alternate history version of the Wild West. The trailer shows that the events of the game align with Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, which is a nice touch. We get to see the cowboy protagonist visit the HQ of the secret vampire-hunting corps he works for.

                              <span>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is no stranger to downloadable expansions, with the Trials of the King DLC launching back in July to a mixed audience. For a start, it was locked behind the hardest difficulty in the game, Bahamut.
That said, publisher Square Enix and developer Team Ninja have announced that an all-new DLC will be introduced to the game, named Wanderer of the Rift. The brand-new expansion will become available on PC via Epic, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5, on October 26, 2022.
Much like the expansion before it, this DLC will be available as a part of the Stranger of Paradise season pass. Provided you buy the season pass, which is currently £19.99 or $24.99, you’ll gain access to all three of the content packs for the game.

                              <span>Control of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex IPs has now officially transferred to Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics following their surprisingly cheap sale from Square Enix to Embracer Group. Alex and Jim wonder what this means for the future in the video below.
We know that a new Tomb Raider game is in active development. It’s being developed in Unreal Engine 5, and is set to “unify the timelines” of the classic games and the reboot trilogy. Quite how that will pan out is anyone’s guess: three games in, the reboot trilogy is still at a stage where Lara hasn’t *quite* become the Tomb Raider yet. Not quite risen. Not quite unveiled, still in shadow. See what they did there?
And so, though it introduced supernatural elements early on, the reboot has a lot of as-yet-unspun connective tissue to make up before any convincing bridge between Lara’s traumatic origins having to wade through the gritty realism of shooting Russian mercenaries and feeling quite bad about it, and her zenith (or nadir, depending on who you ask) as a wisecracking aristo thief who gleefully guns to death the last actual living T-Rex.

As was leaked, it&#x27;s about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

                              <span>You start out aiming to restore a princess to a throne, which naturally tempted me on her every turn to lunge onto the nearest spear for a punchline, but I will forgive Tyrant&#x27;s Blessing for circumstances beyond its control.
Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

That&#x27;s Betrayal At Club Low, the latest game from Cosmo D, set in the same strange city as Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City. This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

Remember all the furore over Nier: Automata’s supposed secret church? Well, now you too can play the greatest trick the Internet ever pulled on people who enjoy Yoko Taro games a bit too much. SadFutago’s The Nier: Automata Church mod is finally ready to download from NexusMods.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 won’t be locking new heroes behind a paid battle pass, it’s emerged. Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass. Spector’s comments were an attempt to put an end to speculation over what he described as “incomplete info” circulating online about Overwatch 2’s battle pass.

                              <span>Some details from Skydance New Media’s in-development Marvel game appear to have leaked, ahead of the game’s debut at Disney D23&#x27;s games showcase later today. The game is alleged to star national superheroes Captain America and Wakanda’s Black Panther, and take place during World War 2. Skydance’s project is being headed up by former Uncharted director Amy Hennig, helmer of such unfortunately cancelled projects as Visceral&#x27;s Star Wars action-adventure.

Announced last October, few official details have so-far been shared about the project - currently in development at Skydance New Media, the studio Hennig set up in 2019 - beyond the fact it&#x27;ll be a &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.


And while solid details are still hard to come by, today&#x27;s teaser trailer does appear to confirm rumours circling yesterday - understood to be true by Eurogamer - that Hennig&#x27;s game would be set in WW2, and see Captain America and Black Panther battling the forces of Hydra.

                              <span>Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed tactical RPG Midnight Suns will, following a number of earlier delays, finally launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - but the previously announced Xbox One, PS4, and Switch versions are still missing in action.


Announced last August, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns - which draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s - is superhero strategy game that follows a roster of familiar faces on an adventure blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.


Midnight Suns was originally due to launch in March this year but was delayed last November in order to add &quot;more story, cinematics and overall polish&quot;. Unfortunately, as its revised 7th October approached, publisher 2K and Firaxis made the decision to delay it once more to deliver the best possible experience for everyone.&quot;

                              <span>Little Nightmares - the original instalment in Tarsier Studio&#x27;s gleefully sinister horror platform series - is getting a mobile release, and will launch for iOS and Android sometime this &quot;winter&quot;.


The original Little Nightmares debuted for PC and consoles back in 2017, telling the deliciously unsettling tale of yellow-raincoated moppet Six, as she attempted to escape The Maw - a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.


The adventure was warmly received on release, with Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a &quot;masterpiece of meat and malice&quot; in his Recommended review.

                              <span>Former Call of Duty director and Treyarch co-head Jason Blundell has departed Deviation Games, the studio he co-founded with fellow Call of Duty alumni Dave Anthony - and which is currently working on its first, PlayStation-exclusive project.


Deviation Games&#x27; partnership with Sony was made public in June 2021, with the announcement only going as far as to say the 100-person studio was currently working on a &quot;brand-new original IP&quot;, said to have already been in development for a year at the time.


Blundell&#x27;s departure from Deviation - which comes even before the studio&#x27;s first title has been officially revealed - was announced in a statement shared on Twitter. It did not elaborate further on Blundell&#x27;s leaving, only saying,&quot; We appreciate the contributions Jason has made and we wish him the best in his future endeavours&quot;.

                              <span>There are lots of very good things about From Software&#x27;s majestic Elden Ring, but one of the very best good things - as is the case with much of the developer&#x27;s games - is its sublime soundtrack. And now publisher Bandai Namco has made the entire thing officially available to listen to across a wide range of music streaming services.


The newly released digital soundtrack runs a total of 34 tracks, variously composed by Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Tai Tomisawa - many of whom are long-time From Software collaborators, having worked on the likes of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Bloodborne.


Their cumulative expertise on Elden Ring, though, has created a belter of a soundtrack, and now users of Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, YouTube Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and Deezer can relive their adventures in the Lands Between through the power of sonic reminiscence.

                              <span>Today, Splatoon 3 was released for the Nintendo Switch.
As such, many dedicated fans have taken to Splatoon 2 to say their farewells to the beloved game, leaving Inkopolis Square awash with truly heartwarming messages.
Martin recently awarded Splatoon 3 a Recommended badge, remarking that while there are &quot;few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3&#x27;s multiplayer or campaign&quot; it is still the &quot;best Nintendo&#x27;s spectacular series has been to date&quot;.

Both songs have teaser videos featuring footage from the game.

You can also grab a free skin bundle for Realm Royale, but Hundred Days is certainly the bigger pull of the two.

Bertie and Donlan called Hundred Days charming and bright in their preview piece last year, and it&#x27;s a game I would personally recommend too.

Sony previously shared a taster of the various offerings that will be available in its Norse epic, but Ragnarök&#x27;s lead UX designer Mila Pavlin has now highlighted even more of them, including things such as puzzle modifications and auto-sprinting down muddy roads.


Speaking to Game Informer, Pavlin said that the team focused on four main components when it came to accessibility: Vision, hearing, motor skills, and cognitive understanding.

                              <span>After feigning a mental health crisis, streamer Tyler &quot;Ninja&quot; Blevins has returned after time off to announce he&#x27;ll now be streaming everywhere.

Last week, Ninja tweeted &quot;I just need a break... I don&#x27;t know when I will be back, or where&quot;, removed his profile pictures across all platforms, and changed his display names to &quot;User Not Found&quot;.


Many assumed his actions were signs of burnout and a mental health crisis, but in fact it was just a disgusting ruse before his big return.

                              <span>Blizzard vice president Jon Spector has shed more light on the upcoming release of Overwatch 2 and its Battle Pass heroes.


Following on from rumours claiming Overwatch 2 heroes would need to be unlocked in the Battle Pass via a paid style similar to Fortnite (which sees characters put into the paid battle pass, while the free track simply offers a few rewards), Spector had the following to say:


&quot;Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass - we&#x27;ll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.&quot;

Anderson and Débora, a couple of artists who regularly create tributes to their favourite video games, posted pictures of the skins placed onto a console earlier this week on Instagram.

The designs will be sold worldwide via their storefront called Gom.Gom.Figures.

A report from XGP (via VGC), reveals that those who had pre-ordered the game have been receiving messages informing them that their orders have now been cancelled. 


The message goes on to state this is due to the fact that Stalker 2&#x27;s release date has been pushed back to an &quot;unconfirmed date in the future&quot;. Meanwhile, the pre-order option on the Xbox store appears to have been disabled.

                              <span>EGX is just around the corner, and as a small bonus to all supporters of Eurogamer we&#x27;re offering free upgrades to an early access ticket for the show. You can find a code to claim on your ReedPop ID page, and if you&#x27;ve already bought a ticket and want to take advantage of the free early access upgrade get in touch and we&#x27;ll sort you with a refund for your original purchase. 


There&#x27;s some decent games to check out, though if I&#x27;m honest I&#x27;ll mostly be hanging around the Street Fighter 6 booths - plus some fun live shows, with Bertie putting on a pub quiz on the Friday and Saturday evenings while Ian and Zoe have just put their schedule together. I&#x27;ll even be there myself, so if you want to come and say hello I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find me at The Fox just over the road from the show itself on the Friday and Saturday.


It&#x27;d be lovely to see a few of you to thank you in person for supporting us, as it means a lot to us! It&#x27;s coming up to a year since we launched the supporter programme, which has seen the return of regular podcasts, the off-topic features and the weekly newsletter from myself.

                              <span>Take a break with a quick recap of the things you missed on Eurogamer this week, plus a little more discussion of them. It&#x27;s the Weekly podcast show.


Joining me today are returning-from-holiday editor-in-chief Martin Robinson, who tells us all about Splatoon 3, which he just reviewed. Why didn&#x27;t he give it an Essential like all the other Nintendo games he reviews, hmm? With the help of news reporter Victoria Kennedy, we put him on the spot.


Elsewhere, I talk about A Plague Tale: Requiem, which I played a healthy chunk of this week and have reservations about, though I&#x27;m still looking forward to it coming out next month. And we think about going back to Cyberpunk 2077 for new story expansion Phantom Liberty, which, if The Witcher 3 expansion Blood and Wine is anything to go by, ought to be good.

                              <span>Hello! Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we&#x27;ve found ourselves playing over the last few days. This time: morgues, graphic novels, and a bit of editing.
If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
I had a proper creep-out playing The Mortuary Assistant the other day. All my hair stood on end and I was sweating and my heart was thudding. And it wasn&#x27;t the middle of the night or anything - it was late afternoon and RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race Down Under was blaring in the background - but it didn&#x27;t matter: I shuddered.

                              <span>In my twenties, a night out at the club was the highlight of my week, especially if there was a DJ playing whom I especially loved. I don’t mean one of those gargantuan Ministry of Sound superclubs where you needed a map to find the bathroom. I’m talking about a small, humble neighborhood club with appropriately watery drinks, cool dark alcoves, and a tiny dancefloor where you could work your way into a higher state of consciousness amid a throbbing constellation of moving bodies. I haven’t done that in decades, but tonight I’m bringing it all back for a night out in Off-Peak City – a surreal metropolis filled with anthropomorphic brownstones, hallucinogenic puddles, and some urgent business at the inimitable Club Low.

                              <span>Sure, EGX is mainly all about going hands-on with a whole host of new and unreleased video games, but did you know  you can also watch other people play video games, too?
And by &#x27;people&#x27; I obviously mean Zoe and I, aka the Eurogamer video team (but not Aoife as she&#x27;s on maternity leave). At select times during the four days of the expo, you&#x27;ll find us hanging out over on the EGX live stage where we&#x27;ve got seven (count &#x27;em, seven) catastrophically chaotic live shows planned for your in-person entertainment.
As you can see via the handy image above, among our offering is a return to the classic days of PUBG first thing on Thursday, and a special live episode of Happy Hour Tavern Time on the Friday, during which we&#x27;ll play Cult of the Lamb while answering questions from the audience (bring your best BMKs).

                              <span>Welcome to the August 2022 report from the Reproducible Builds project! In these reports we outline the most important things that we have been up to over the past month. As a quick recap, whilst anyone may inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users as pre-compiled binaries. The motivation behind the reproducible builds effort is to ensure no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

                              <span>Since I&#x27;m writing about my NAS, a month ago I happened to
notice an odd kernel message:
Aug 8 04:04] list_del corruption. prev-&gt;next should be ffff90c96e9c2090,
but was ffff90c94e9c2090

A kernel dev friend said &quot;I&#x27;m familiar with that code ... you should run memtest86&quot;.
This seemed like advice it would be foolish to ignore!
I installed the memtest86 package, which on Debian stable, is actually the
formerly open-source &quot;memtest86&quot; software, last updated in 2014, rather than
the currently open-source &quot;memtest86+&quot;. However the package (incorrectly, I
think) Recommends: memtest86+ so I ended up with both. The package scripts
integrate with GRUB, so both were added as boot options.
Neither however, would boot on my NAS, which is a UEFI system: after selection
from the GRUB prompt, I just had a blank screen. I focussed for a short while
on display issues: I wondered if trying to run a 4k monitor over HDMI was too
much to expect from a memory tester OS, but my mainboard has a VGA out as well.
It has some quirky behaviour for the VGA out: the firmware doesn&#x27;t use it at
all, so output only begins appearing after something boots (GRUB for example).
I fiddled about with the HDMI output, VGA output, and trying different RGB
cables, to no avail.
The issue was (likely) nothing to do with the video out, but rather that the
packaged versions of memtest/memtest86+ don&#x27;t work properly on UEFI
systems. What did work, was Passmark Software&#x27;s non-FOSS
memtest86. It drew on HDMI, albeit in a postage
stamp sized window. After some time (much less than I expected, some kind of
magic modern memory matrix stuff going on I think), I got a clean bill of
health:






It&#x27;s quite possible the FOSS versions of memtest (pcmemtest is another)
have better support for UEFI in more recent versions than I installed (I
just went with what&#x27;s in Debian stable), and if not, then this is a worthy
feature to work on.</span>

In that case it makes sense to check:
if pulseaudio is running
systemctl status --user pulseaudio

if pulseaudio is running, that you have a list from input (sources) and output (sinks) audio devices in the Gnome Desktop Settings. You can also check from the command line with
pactl list sources

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

In order to save the cosy town of Sainte-et-Claire, a charming mouse called Lila and a soft spirit called Lumion join forces to restore the town and its people. They&#x27;ll be teaming up on Steam later this month on September 26th. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

That&#x27;s a reasonable price for even one of these games, let alone the 18 games included in this bundle.

                              <span>Ahead of its official unveiling at tomorrow&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, new rumours have emerged surrounding Skydance Media and Amy Hennig&#x27;s upcoming Marvel title.


Announced last October, few official details have so-far been shared on the project beyond the fact it&#x27;ll be a &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.


However, Marvel rumour collator MCU Status is now reporting that Hennig&#x27;s game takes place during World War 2, and will see Captain America and Black Panther taking on the forces of Hydra. Eurogamer understands this to be correct.

To that end, Microsoft is this week launching what it calls a &quot;multi-month series of experiments to learn how to create a more personalised home screen experience and address some of the top trends and fan requests.&quot;

                              <span>Lars Gustavsson, creative director on the Battlefield series, is leaving its developer DICE after more than 20 years at the studio.


News of Gustavsson&#x27;s departure from Battlefield, DICE, and indeed EA as a whole, was announced by Battlefield general manager Byron Beede in a blog post detailing the future of the long-running first-person shooter series.


&quot;Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since the beginning and is affectionately known as Mr Battlefield, has decided he is ready for a new adventure,&quot; Beede wrote. &quot;Lars has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to Battlefield and is proud to have helped shape the franchise into what it is today. He is excited to pass the baton to the next generation of Battlefield creators at DICE, Ripple Effect, Industrial Toys, and Ridgeline Games.&quot;

A couple of weeks ago it emerged that the case had been filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, alleging that Sony abuses its position in the market to unfairly charge customers.

Leading the lawsuit is Alex Neill, who took to reddit to field questions about the case. It went about as well as you would expect - not at all.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly 10 years since my guest today started working at Eurogamer. And when they began, their mission was simple: make YouTube happen. We had barely an audience there at the time. Oh, we&#x27;d tried video - you might remember Johnny Minkley and Eurogamer TV - but we missed the YouTube wave. So along came Ian Higton, my guest today, to make it right.


He didn&#x27;t solve YouTube alone or overnight of course - to do that he would need a team and time. But it was his tireless work, largely alone for two years, that laid the foundation for what was to come. And his continued work has helped shape Eurogamer on YouTube into the channel it is today: a popular and welcoming place Ian is super proud of. Listen to him talk about it in the podcast - it&#x27;s lovely.


I didn&#x27;t realise how long he&#x27;d worked in TV beforehand, though. I knew Ian had worked for a shopping channel, which is brilliant, but I didn&#x27;t realise he was there for 10 years! He even rose quite high up. And he once dressed as Skeletor to covertly appear on camera for a Halloween special, and it was recorded so you can watch it too. That&#x27;s the cheeky Ian we know!

                              <span>The creator of adorable fox-themed action-adventure game Tunic says the offerings of Xbox Game Pass are the closest thing we have to the old school rental shops of days gone by.


Speaking to TrueTrophies (via TrueAchievements), Andrew Shouldice praised Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service, on which Tunic released, calling it an &quot;incredible deal&quot; for developers.


&quot;I think the thing that I liked most about it, that I didn&#x27;t think about at the time, is the experience of going to - in Canada - to rent a game,&quot; Shouldice elaborated.

                              <span>What&#x27;s the longest you&#x27;ve ever waited for a video game sequel? Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers was released all the way back in 1997 on the Sega Saturn, a first-person dungeon crawler JRPG made by developer Atlus. Four console generations later we finally have a sequel - Soul Hackers 2 - though it&#x27;s really a standalone game with mostly thematic connections to the original. 25 years is a long time in computer graphics, and Soul Hackers 2 has a wide variety of tech it could potentially use - but early footage didn&#x27;t exactly impress. There&#x27;s little here to suggest that the current wave of consoles are being taxed by this Persona-lite release - and the knock-on effect of that seems to be that the last-gen machines get some shocking ports, especially the vanilla Xbox One. 


Soul Hackers 2 borrows its gameplay elements from other recent Atlus titles, so at a basic level, it&#x27;s a turn-based RPG oriented around exploiting weaknesses, which is an enjoyable enough system but nothing out-of-the ordinary for RPG veterans. There are some twists, like an overkill-style mechanic that rewards strategic play, and plenty of customization. But this isn&#x27;t especially novel. Elsewhere, however, this game really shines. Soul Hackers 2 is a party-oriented title that weaves multiple characters through a winding, serialised story. Interpersonal conflicts and interactions take center stage here, and a social system gamifies out-of-combat interactions, giving simple conversations actual consequences. It&#x27;s more like a TV show than a movie, with a &#x27;villain of the week&#x27;-style narrative that features multiple short story arcs that build over time. 


This formula is fairly novel by industry standards but if you&#x27;ve played other recent Atlus RPGs - particularly Persona 5 or Tokyo Mirage Sessions - you&#x27;ll know what to expect. That fortunately extends to the rest of the package as well, with a keen sense of visual style. But you can&#x27;t make a video game out of artistic flourishes alone - so how does the 3D rendering hold up?

                              <span>Every time my daughter tells me about Minecraft&#x27;s 1.19 update, she describes it in completely different terms. Thrilled: &quot;One thing 1.19 introduced is these little animals, Allays, and if you give them an item they&#x27;ll go and find more of them!&quot; Frantic: &quot;There&#x27;s a new new boss called the Warden and it&#x27;s the very first blind Minecraft mob.  It can&#x27;t see you. It only does stuff by hearing so that&#x27;s why you always want to bring a sack of wool when you&#x27;re trying to find one.&quot; Strangely frank: &quot;I think a lot of people think Minecraft swamps are boring. 1.19 tries to change that.&quot;


My Minecraft expert is nine years old, and she&#x27;s an expert in Minecraft in the way that only a nine-year-old can be an expert in a game. Minecraft is a ready metaphor for everything in her life, but she&#x27;s also deeply engaged in the minutiae of it. She has no fear of its depths and complexities. I went through a period of thinking it was sort of sad that she didn&#x27;t draw in the evenings as much any more or play with her doll&#x27;s house, but now I realise: she still does this stuff. She just sometimes does it in Minecraft, and it&#x27;s all evolved and started to flow together: drawing, playing, landscape and imagination.


Let&#x27;s go back a bit. Like a lot of kids, ours has three or four games that come in and out of favour as the weeks pass. Minecraft, though, is the game that all the others orbit - it&#x27;s always in the number one spot. In many ways it&#x27;s the game she measures all other games by.

However, in April 2021, the project was cancelled, with reports claiming a dispute with mega-games company Tencent was the catalyst for this decision.


Now, speaking to GameSpot, Amazon Games president Christoph Hartmann confirmed this was indeed the case.


&quot;We had a deal with a Hong Kong-based company, Leyou; I think it would have been great to work with them. But they later got sold to Tencent and it just got very complicated,&quot; Hartmann explained.

                              <span>I&#x27;d forgotten how stressful A Plague Tale can be. These kids really don&#x27;t get a break do they? It&#x27;s probably not right to even call them kids any more either - I&#x27;m not sure how old Amicia is now, in Requiem, the sequel, but she&#x27;s a young woman in attitude alone. She&#x27;s been through some stuff, they both have - Amicia and her younger brother Hugo - and they&#x27;ve been shaped by it. And whereas they largely ran from trouble in Innocence, and all of their abilities were based around escaping, more or less, now they&#x27;ve got some fight in them. They&#x27;re killers, and that changes things a bit, but I&#x27;ll come to that.
The stress: it&#x27;s a good and bad thing. Part of it is absolutely intended, I believe. Developer Asobo wants us to feel the relentlessness of the challenge Amicia and Hugo face in staying alive. They&#x27;re still mercilessly hunted by a shady organisation with a never ending supply of soldiers, and they&#x27;re still very much at danger from the plague ravaging the land: The Black Death and the hordes of rats that carry it.
Their existence is one escape from death after another. My goodness, by the end of the few chapters of Requiem I play, Amicia is a walking wreck, carrying a concussion that&#x27;s made her collapse more than once. But she slogs on because she has to - I really like Amicia (both the character and the way she&#x27;s acted and brought to life); I&#x27;m less keen on Hugo. The point is, they don&#x27;t get a moment to relax so nor should you. And that&#x27;s fine, but when the game is frustrating to play, problems arise.

                              <span>Just days after releasing an updated early access roadmap for Phasmophobia, developer Kinetic Games has announced the ghost hunting sim&#x27;s next big patch - known as the Apocalypse Update - will be arriving on 27th September.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Phasmophobia&#x27;s Apocalypse Update, starting with the arrival of the new Sunny Meadows Mental Institution map - an entirely reworked, more visually interesting, and, crucially, more compact version of the game&#x27;s previously released Asylum map.


A recent poll suggested smaller maps were high on the list of players&#x27; wants, and - intentionally or otherwise - the Apocalypse Update seems to be delivering on that front. Not only is a smaller Sunny Meadows variant known as &#x27;Restricted&#x27; included - offering &quot;5 small maps in 1&quot; - it also adds Camp Woodwind, a miniature variant of the Maple Lodge Campsite map.

This includes PlayStation 5 and Apple Arcade for the first time. On PS5, it will be &quot;tailored&quot; to the Dualsense controller, and after a year’s absence, the Touch series returns to Apple devices through the Apple Arcade platform.
“FM23 marks another significant step forward for the Football Manager series as we debut on two new platforms,&quot; said Miles Jacobson, Sports Interactive’s studio director. &quot;Fans have been calling for us to produce a PlayStation title for a number of years, so I’m excited for those players to now get the chance to experience the closest thing to being a real football manager.&quot;

                              <span>It’s been over 20 years since we first set off from The Shire with Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the Ring of Power, and despite a series of lacklustre Hobbit films doing their best to extinguish it, the passion still burns hot as the fires of Mount Doom for that quintessential trilogy of fantasy epics. In the times before and since those releases, with the exception of Tolkien’s other literary works, fans have relied heavily on video game interpretations to continue their direct relationship with the characters, settings, and stories of Middle-earth and the One Ring.
But, after a series of spin-offs and non-canon additions slowly boiling the purity of the IP down to directionless mediocrity, it’s critical that future iterations endeavour to recapture the familiarity and emotion that comes with being part of something that you believe in before it’s even begun. That’s right — I’m talking about movie tie-ins. Look, you might scoff, and I wouldn’t blame you for doing so considering tie-in history, but Electronic Arts mastered this in the early noughties with their direct film-to-game releases of The Two Towers and The Return of the King, and it’s about time that we reached for the same dizzying heights of success.

A lot of the complication revolves around licensing, and we don’t want to get too bogged down in that. But to summarise, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the rest of Tolkien’s works fall under an extremely complex network of rights that gives even Goldeneye a run for its money. But the fundamentals can be worked out when it comes to game development. The Tolkien Estate, at one time, held all the rights to all of Tolkien’s works. Over time, these rights have changed hands and have been split into different sections, ultimately resulting in Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit falling under one banner, whilst the rest of his works (such as The Silmarillion and The Unfinished Tales) fall under another.

Starting this week, a random subset of Xbox Insiders in the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring will see some of these changes as the Xbox team experiments with different approaches.
In addition, the team is exploring options for new game channels and collections when you scroll down. This will include content curated for you based on the games you’ve played or how to make the most out of your Game Pass subscription.

                              <span>Sega may have long since left console manufacturing behind, but the Dreamcast remains one of the longest-lived games consoles going, with fans ever so occasionally putting out new Dreamcast releases. The system has a cult following - the Dreamcast never dies.


The latest new development in Dreamcast technology is now available to be backed on crowd-funding site Indiegogo - and it’s a curious upgrade to one of the system’s most unique features - its VMU memory cards.


For those of you who aren’t rapidly hurtling towards their forties or indeed already there, the VMU (Visual Memory Unit) was a fascinating take on the memory cards of the time, making them interactive and fun rather than simply a slab of plastic that held your save data. Original VMUs contained a little LCD screen that could display information from the game you’re currently playing - providing a very rudimentary two-screen experience years before the Nintendo DS would do the same with far more utility.

Developed by Sweden-based Stray Fawn Studio, the game takes place in a world where mysterious, toxic plants are spreading. You will need to lead a small group of survivors as they seek shelter on the back of a giant beast they call Onbu.
You will need to help the villagers build a functioning settlement and form a relationship with Onbu to survive the hostile world. As you expand the village over Onbu’s back, you will need to utilize the limited space as efficiently as possible.

                              <span>The next game in The Division series may have had its details released early, thanks to the Ubisoft store page for the game being set live prematurely. While the website has since been hastily taken down, a handful of eagle-eyed people on the internet managed to catch if before it vanished, and published the info online.
One such person, Unknown1Z1 on Twitter, recorded the page in full prior to its removal. In it, we can see several features we can expect to come to the game, as well as a basic description of what it’ll actually be.
The Division: Heartland will be a “free-to-play survival-action multiplayer shooter” according to the store listing. Set in middle America, the game will have a PvEvP mission type called Storm Operations, which has 45 players take part in a battle against “A group of dangerous rogue agents, an aggressive faction known as The Vultures, all while surviving a lethal virus”.

                              <span>In a photoshoot fit for Vogue, Hideo Kojima has shared some snaps to Twitter of him posing with some new Cryptobiosis plushies that’ll be available at Tokyo Game Show later this month.
Details have not yet been revealed regarding the price of the plushies, or whether they’ll be available online during and after Tokyo Game Show. What we do know, however, is that they’re quite charming, even if they are strange, small life forms used for replenishing blood.
Going off the photos that Kojima shared, it appears the plushies will be available in two sizes. One of them being small enough to prop up on a shelf or cuddle to sleep, while the other is large enough to make the perfect cushion, as Kojima exhibits. The plushies are also shown off beside a Danboard figurine for size reference!

                              <span>Despite Microsoft&#x27;s intent to continue making Call of Duty available on PlayStation platforms beyond the current deal with Activision, Sony says the offer is &quot;inadequate on many levels.&quot;
The offer was made privately between the two companies, but PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan made his feelings on the matter known after Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed it publically. This is the latest in a cascade of events following Microsoft&#x27;s decision to acquire Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, which is currently pending regulator approvals.
In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Ryan explained that Microsoft&#x27;s offer does not consider the impact on PlayStation players. Microsoft&#x27;s assurances, which Spencer made public in a comment to The Verge earlier this month, reference a written commitment in January that promised Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation &quot;for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract.&quot;

                              <span>I have just filed a complaint with the CRTC about my phone
provider&#x27;s outrageous fees. This is a copy of the complaint.


I am traveling to Europe, specifically to Ireland, for a 6 days for a
work meeting.
I thought I could use my phone there. So I looked at my phone provider&#x27;s
services in Europe, and found the &quot;Fido roaming&quot; services:
https://www.fido.ca/mobility/roaming
The fees, at the time of writing, at fifteen (15!) dollars PER DAY
to get access to my regular phone service (not unlimited!!).
If I do not use that &quot;roaming&quot; service, the fees are:
2$/min
0.75$/text
10$/20MB
That is absolutely outrageous. Any random phone plan in Europe will be
cheaper than this, by at least one order of magnitude. Just to take
any example:

This month I accepted 375 and rejected 25 packages. The overall number of packages that got accepted was 386.
I also had a closer look at the RM-bugs. All in all I addressed about 90 of them and either simply removed the package or added a moreinfo tag. In total I spent 13 hours for this task.
Anyway, if you want to have your RM-bug processed in a timely manner, please have a look at the removal page and check whether the created dak command is really what you wanted. It would also help if you check the reverse dependencies and write a comment whether they are important or can be ignored or also file a new bug for them. Each removal must have one bug!

                              <span>PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has spoken out against Microsoft&#x27;s offer to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Sony&#x27;s existing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard, calling the deal &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot; - despite Microsoft&#x27;s insistence it went &quot;well beyond typical gaming industry agreements&quot;.


It&#x27;s the latest shot fired in an increasingly public back and forth between the two companies as governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard grows, particularly in relation to its impact on other gaming platforms. The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, for instance, recently said the deal would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


It&#x27;s in this climate that Xbox boss Phil Spencer last week attempted to placate concerns it might be looking to make the hugely popular Call of Duty series - which the CMA called &quot;important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals&#x27; gaming platforms&quot; - an Xbox exclusive if the acquisition gained approval, insisting that it had &quot;provided a signed agreement to Sony [in January] to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably not much of a surprise given CD Projekt&#x27;s previous assertion that its currently in-development new Witcher game would mark the start of a &quot;new saga for the franchise&quot;, but the studio has now explicitly confirmed it&#x27;s already &quot;thinking about&quot; new instalments beyond that.


Asked to elaborate on the company&#x27;s use of the word &quot;saga&quot; during CD Projekt&#x27;s latest earnings call, president and joint CEO Adam Kiciński clarified that &quot;like the first saga was three games...we are in pre-production of the first game from the second Witcher saga.&quot; As such, the studio is  already &quot;thinking about more than one game&quot;.


Hardly a shocking revelation, admittedly, but additional clarity is always welcome.

                              <span>Whether a game console is a smash hit or an abject failure, I find myself drawn to all of them - and typically there&#x27;s at least one killer game you have to play. Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U arguably fits into the latter category, despite the fact that the system actually has a bunch of exceptional releases - and one of those titles is the original Splatoon, effectively Nintendo&#x27;s take on the third-person shooter genre with its own unique twist, the paint system. It&#x27;s a game that oozes style, kind of like Nintendo&#x27;s take on a classic Dreamcast game - and it&#x27;s brilliant. 


Like many Wii U titles, Splatoon hit Switch via a sequel: familiar in many ways, but fleshed out with a more comprehensive single-player offering and the excellent Octo expansion. Five years on, the third instalment is here - and there are plenty of changes and improvements to consider. I liked Splatoon 2, but this new release feels like a proper sequel, improving on the series&#x27; strengths and moving in new directions. The presentation instantly feels more elaborate, the single-player mode is vast and the visuals have improved. It feels like the game Nintendo has been working towards since the very beginning. 


That starts with your first contact with the game - a basic menu on the Wii U original with more polish on the sequel with a title sequence leading into the training sequence. Splatoon 3 makes far more of an impact, with a mysterious desert scene instantly setting the stage for what&#x27;s to come. The camera then cuts to your character with a more fully fleshed-out, animation rich character customisation sequence. It then seamlessly pans over to the starting point before kicking into the training mission.

                              <span>Developer Amplitude Studios has unveiled Together We Rule, the first major expansion for its historical 4X strategy game Humankind - one that&#x27;ll bring new diplomacy and espionage focused additions when it launches some time this autumn.


&quot;In Humankind,&quot; Amplitude explains in its announcement,&quot; we’ve always wanted there to be more ways to win than simple military domination. And while the game’s unified victory condition, Fame, was a first step towards that, we’re now ready to take things much further&quot;.


To that end, Together We Rule (which follows several smaller culture-focused DLC packs) will introduce new features - including the Congress of Humankind, Embassies, and Agents - that are intended to &quot;help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently&quot;.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 1 released last week for the PlayStation 5. 


Being a from-the-ground remake for the current generation of consoles - and given Naughty Dog&#x27;s reputation for attention to detail - everyone assumed that this release would be full of new improvements and fun inclusions along with the core gameplay.      


Now, these assumptions have been proven true, with The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s community sharing some of their recent discoveries online. Please note there will be spoilers for The Last of Us Part 1 in the article below.

The news arrived alongside the latest trailer for Scarlet and Violet, which dropped earlier today. 

On Twitter, Nintendo posted a video of the model, complete with some shiny visual effects, to show off the Scarlet and Violet inspired designs.

The Wii U era was a commercial nadir for Nintendo, enlightened by the spark of something new; the lurid splash of colour that was Splatoon, a long-awaited all-new IP from the house that built Mario, and an impeccably enjoyable subversion of the modern-day shooter. For a company that can be too quick to fall back on the familiar, it offered the shock of the genuinely new.

                              <span>It looks like Phantom Liberty could be the only planned expansion for Cyberpunk 2077.


Yesterday, CD Projekt Red confirmed the name of the forthcoming expansion due in 2023 and the return of Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand during its Edgerunners livestream.



However, a comment on a YouTube video teasing the expansion suggests it could be the only one.

                              <span>Corecell has hit back at publisher PQube, disputing its defence over withheld funds.


Last week, PQube was under fire once again from a developer (Corecell) releasing a damning statement against the publisher. It followed earlier accusations from Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions that left the team &quot;feeling manipulated and exploited&quot;.




With regards to its game AeternoBlade 2, Corecell claimed that PQube &quot;only paid a small part of the minimum guarantee of the signing milestone by the time we sent them the game and they never paid the remaining milestones&quot;, among other issues over publishing control.

                              <span>Gloomwood came alive for me when I got outside. This is immersive-sim-ish territory, everything tilted towards horror and stealth. Navigating the lovingly rendered PS1 era visuals, which do help a great deal to make ordinary objects singular and creepy, I awake at the bottom of a pit with nothing but a mysterious ally, taunting me through a nearby grate before offering me a magic ring. The ring allows me to tell when I&#x27;m hidden in shadow, and once it&#x27;s on my hand and the grate has been opened, I start to realise how useful it&#x27;s going to be.


My ally is nowhere to be seen. Instead I&#x27;m in small squirrely rooms, keeping out of the path of patrolling guards, lurking in the dark, moving from one safe spot to the next. I need to get out, which might mean finding the objects needed to call a kind of grain elevator, and may mean busting my swordstick out of a nearby lockup. Gloomwood&#x27;s linear but roomy: like I say, immersive-sim territory. I always know where I want to go, but my path there has a bit of leeway to it.


Combat I quickly discover, even with the swordstick, is a bad idea. Take guards on and they&#x27;ll slice your health away and slow you down. So much better to crouch, go slowly, considering the surfaces you&#x27;re moving across, using the leaning buttons to check around blind corners, using patience, sweet patience, to learn the patrol routes and then go for the one-hit backstab.

In anticipation of his arrival, the team has shared more about Gizmo&#x27;s moveset and confirmed that he will be a support character, much like the likes of Scooby-Doo&#x27;s Velma.


The small card shared on the MultiVersus Twitter feed states that Gizmo will have a move called &quot;Gizmo-A-Go-Go&quot;. This will see Gizmo attaching himself onto the back of his allies. He will also be able to &quot;sing and spawn musical note projectiles&quot; that will damage nearby enemies thanks to a move called Song of the Mogwai.

This bundle, known as the Hazel Bundle, will allow players to &quot;suit up&quot; as Umbrella Acadamy&#x27;s other time travelling assassin Hazel (the clue was in the name there), thanks to the new legendary operative skin. It comes with the pink dog head and all, and is available now.


&quot;Everything happens like it&#x27;s supposed to... including your enemies getting eliminated,&quot; reads the teaser for this latest Call of Duty collaboration, which you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t entirely convinced by MultiVersus when it leaked. We&#x27;ve seen countless platform fighters challenge Super Smash Bros across the decades, usually falling flat. Even Sony&#x27;s own attempt with PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale was middling, so I didn&#x27;t particularly rate a Warner Bros crossover&#x27;s chances. I&#x27;ll gladly admit those initial impressions were wrong. Even as a free-to-play game, that carries the usual monetisation pitfalls, MultiVersus sets itself apart where it matters. 

You can attribute some of that to the unusual MultiVersus character roster, which isn&#x27;t especially cohesive. Packing 18 fighters with more planned, they all fall under Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s licensing, but mixing Game of Thrones characters with Bugs Bunny just feels strange, no matter how you slice it. That said, I never questioned it once I started playing - everyone&#x27;s been well adapted. That&#x27;s helped by voice actors reprising their roles, with Kevin Conroy and Matthew Lillard returning for Batman and Shaggy respectively as major highlights. It&#x27;s a shame MultiVersus doesn&#x27;t give each franchise a specific arena to complement its cast, though you&#x27;ll spot familiar sights like the Bat Cave. 

It&#x27;s worth studying each character beforehand, since MultiVersus groups them between five classes. We&#x27;ve got the heavy-hitting bruisers, agile assassins, defensively-minded tank class, ranged mages, and support classes who&#x27;re better at buffs than damage. I appreciate this variety and the game prioritises 2v2 team fights as its main way to play, those support classes in particular helping MultiVersus to lean into this co-op emphasis well. (There&#x27;s also 1v1 fights and 4-player free for all&#x27;s but, annoyingly, no local co-op, which is a shame.)

                              <span>Stray Fawn&#x27;s The Wandering Village - a city building sim set on the back of a giant, roaming creature - will be launching into Steam early access next Wednesday, 14th September.


Announced last August, The Wandering Village tasks players with constructing a safe haven for a group of survivors in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world. Its city building aspects might be familiar, but those are combined with resource management, rogue-like elements, and survival, all connected to the ever-moving creature, known as Onbu, the survivors now call home.


&quot;Forging a relationship between the villagers and Onbu might be challenging at times, as their interests often don’t align,&quot; Stray Fawn explains. &quot;As a living creature, its unique body poses its own challenges for your village design. There&#x27;s every chance a spike may have grown where villagers intended to place their kitchen, while a failed harvest may cause desperation and tempt villagers to draw blood from the creature for food.&quot;

                              <span>PowerWash Simulator - developer FuturLab&#x27;s wildly compelling dirt-busting squirt &#x27;em up - is currently celebrating 3m million players having hoisted nozzles since the game&#x27;s launch on Xbox and PC back in May. And that milestone coincides with the opening of nominations for the next filth-encrusted edifice to be added to the game.


There&#x27;s not much more to say on the 3m players front, which Futurlab announced on Twitter earlier today, other than to say its success is thoroughly well-deserved. Eurgamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese - who wrote about the serene pleasures of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s sedate busywork in July - is far from the only member of the editorial team to have fallen in love with its daffy charms and compulsive rhythms.


And if, like me, you&#x27;ve reached the end of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s gloriously ludicrous campaign and urgently require more things to blast back into the realms of cleanliness, the good news is FuturLab is currently working on new additions - with the developer currently taking suggestions for what should come next.

                              <span>Tekken 8 was teased at EVO 2022 back at the start of August with a little cinematic that took viewers back to Kazuya’s ending cutscene from the original Tekken. You know the one, it was where we learned about his favourite hobby… throwing people he’s related to into an active volcano. This new teaser has made the series’ longterm fans excited to get ready for the next battle once again, and it’s also made me think about what I would like to see from the franchise as it moves forward onto the current generation of consoles.

Before we go ahead, I should preface the rest of this article by letting you know that I am a Tekken fan, and I’ve been playing the series since I first got my hands on Tekken 2 back on the original PlayStation. Everything I’m about to say comes from a place of love for the Tekken series, and well, a little bit of envy for what the bloodier competition has been delivering to its audience. I once got the wind knocked out of me by a partner because I was juggling her as Lei Wulong, and she didn’t find it very funny. I still play Tekken. I love Tekken as much as you do. I just think it needs to evolve in its presentation – and that the developers at Bandai Namco could learn a thing or two from NetherRealm. 
As a fighting game, Tekken 7 has by this point proven it has everything it needs to be one of the big multiplayer powerhouses. New mechanics like Rage Arts and screw hits are welcome additions to the fighter’s formula, and after several DLC releases the roster now has just about every Tekken character a dedicated player is likely to want to see, even including some weirdo guests. Fighting game fans know at this point that Tekken 7 is a solid, good time, and that’s why it’s the best selling entry in the series. But if Bandai Namco wants to sell even more copies next time – even quicker – then how does it recruit new competitors for us to fight online?

In the Game Informer video, you can see Kratos and Atreus travling through Svartalfheim in a canoe, but according to GI, there may be other ways to travel through the realm.
The video not only shows off the large industrialized area but a bit of gameplay too. As you can see, Kratos can freeze geysers with his Leviathan Axe and smash hindrances like pots with his Chaos Blades. In the realm, the duo will come across mine pits, artificial water channels, and large cities that will no doubt harbor some &quot;complex&quot; environmental puzzles.

                              <span>It’s a massive day for Warframe fans out there, in fact, it’s kind of like Warframe Christmas right now. The Veilbreaker update is launching with new Kahl missions, Protea Deluxe has landed in-game, and perhaps most excitingly, Styanax is here.
 A free gift to players (for a limited time) to celebrate the 50th frame added to the sci-fi MMORPG, Styanax marks a major milestone in the ongoing journey Digital Extremes has ventured through over the last few years. Going from hail mary release of Warframe back in the day all the way to recent months as it expands its tendrils into a multi-game developer and publisher. 
To find out more about the design of this new frame, its conception, and how it reflects a newer and more contemporary Digital Extremes, I sat down with lead game designer Pablo Alonso, as well as newly-pink-shorted creative director Rebecca Ford (which apparently don’t even fit. Mrs Ford later informed me that a pair of sparkly pink boots will make an appearance on the next Dev Stream).

                              <span>Yesterday afternoon CDPR gave us all a huge update on the future of Cyberpunk 2077, which has gone from strength to strength since its troubled launch and has emerged as an essential next-gen experience.  Fans can look forward to a decent looking anime series that&#x27;s confirmed to be 100% canon with the games, continued updates that fix issues and add little bits of content here and there, and finally: a full-fat expansion which will add tonnes of new areas, characters, and story missions to the game. 
Sadly, however, for those still on PS4 and Xbox One, today&#x27;s 1.6 patch is the last update you will receive until you upgrade to next-gen or PC.
It was always a compromise on the old consoles, and CDPR look like they&#x27;re ready to let go of what is still an enormous share of the market, as pandemics, cost of living squeezes, and semiconductor shortages have made the Xbox Series and PS5 consoles a bit tricky to get a hold of.

It&#x27;s a more basic version of the current Series 2, comes in white, and features adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair trigger locks, and a wrap-around rubberized grip. It will run you $129.99.
However, you can change components on the controller by opting to purchase the Complete Component Pack that comes with interchangeable thumbsticks, paddle shapes, and D-pad. The pack includes a carrying case, charging dock, and USB-C cable. It will run you $59.99 and is compatible with all Series 2 models, not just Core.

                              <span>Finally, it has happened. CD Projekt RED has got out in front of the greatest problem with Cyberpunk 2077, and done the right thing. It’s years too late, of course – but the studio has finally done what it should’ve done before the game even released: it’s jettisoned the previous-generation versions.
Yesterday’s Night City Wire broadcast wasn’t exactly groundbreaking in its content, but it did contain exciting news for those who actually enjoyed the base Cyberpunk 2077. The live stream was mostly focused around promoting the imminent release of a Cyberpunk universe anime on Netflix – and in a cool twist, that animated show is entirely canon to the games, with designs and even some of the world layout ripped right from the digital version of Night City. 
Bookending a whole lot of anime talk was a little bit of video game stuff, however – confirmation of a new patch which includes some new content based around the anime, and the reveal of Phantom Liberty, the hotly anticipated expansion for the game. We got to learn a little about this expansion, including the fact that it’ll be a sort of spy-thriller that sees V working for the US government, and confirmation that Keanu Reeves has returned to the recording booth to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand for this new story.

In the games, you are enrolled in a school that hosts an independent study project called A Treasure Hunt. Three stories will be woven into your adventures while traversing the Paldea region.
One is called Victory Road, and it finds you going to Gyms in different locations to achieve Champion Rank. The second is Path of Legends. Here, Upperclassmen Arven will join you in search of rare ingredients called Herba Mystica. The third story is called Starfall Street and finds you challenging Team Star, a &quot;group of delinquents&quot; causing trouble for the school.

                              <span>Zombies have started taking over and causing havoc across Classic WoW, thanks to the legendary plague event added to the game early this morning. Across World of Warcraft, suspicious boxes can be found in hubs such as Booty Bay, which allows players to self-infect and go off and be mischievous.
To find out more about the Classic WoW zombie experience, I jumped in (before the massive queue times started) and met up with several players looking to make a mess in Classic WoW, through a truly limited, special event that may never return again.
My gateway to a zombie adventure was Millehouse, a level 48 Rogue in my guild who was going to great lengths to make the lives of horde players significantly spookier. They told me via in-game whispers: “I got to the crossroads and infected like 30 people. I don’t kill them, I just infect them so it can spread.”

                              <span>A couple of weeks ago, I described Splatoon 3 as a ‘difficult game to preview’, largely because of its iterative nature. It’s like reviewing a Call of Duty game, I suppose – bits and pieces change from one game to another, but the development machine for such an established franchise has gotten so sophisticated and so well-defined that any review inevitably isn’t going to be talking about big-ticket changes. It’s a little nip here, a little tuck there, and a modest extension to an under-developed feature. 

To put it another way, jumping from Splatoon 2 to this latest sequel is more like renovating a beloved old house rather than outright moving. That leads to a natural early conclusion of this review, and it’s a time-honored cliche: if you liked old Splatoon, you’ll love this! It’s like that, but better! Well, duh. Obviously. 
This also means that the sentiment expressed in the preview carries over here; it’s a difficult game to review. I could get into the minutiae of things like new weapons, new fashion looks, a barnstorming new mode in the form of the three-way turf war, or the improved Salmon Run mode, for instance. But then I’m waxing lyrical for thousands of words getting into tight specifics that, honestly, the hardcore probably already know, having voraciously consumed pre-release content, and the casual probably don’t particularly care to know.

                              <span>A new PlayStation 5 firmware update rolled out this morning to all owners. This is the official release of the latest major update, which entered beta late in July. All the features announced then have carried over, available to be experienced by everyone.
The chief new addition is support for 1440p resolution, which is very useful for players using their PS5 with a PC monitor, or any display that can only go up to 1440p. This resolution is a midway point between the ageing 1080p, and the demanding 4K. Previously, the PS5 was only able to detect either.
1440p support can be tested using a button in the settings menu, to make sure your display supports it. Unfortunately, and quite inexplicably, running the console in 1440p turns off VRR. PS5 currently only supports VRR for 1080p and 4K. VRR allows the screen to sync its refresh rate to the framerate of the game, eliminating screen tearing and making for an overall smoother experience, even when framerate is inconsistent.

                              <span>The latest from Subnautica developer, Unknown Worlds, is turn-based tabletop game Moonbreaker. Set in a sci-fi universe, players will be able to collect and digitally paint their own figurines before showing them off during play; something my inner painter is excited for!
While Moonbreaker is set to launch in Steam&#x27;s Early Access later this month on September 29, playtests are currently being arranged for those who want to try out the game even earlier.
Playtests will be via Steam, and the first ones will be happening on September 9 and 11 respectively. If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have time on those days, do not fret, as even more playtests will be happening on September 16 and 18, too.

                              <span>The veil around Steelrising has lifted, meaning early review impressions of the third-person action game, alongside all its shiny bits and blemishes, are out in the wild for the world to see. Comparisons to the rest of the genre, especially the From Software games that have set the bar, are impossible to avoid.
To go alongside our in-depth review of Steelrising, Connor and Jim have sat down to talk briefly about some of the games best and dodgiest parts. You can check out that video below, which you should absolutely do if you want a quick fix of informal discussion, or the occasional botched French word here and there.
Not to spoil it or anything, but Connor talks about the revolutionary France setting of the game, something they found particularly interesting throughout the process of their review. This pro comes with a chaser, the way your character’s background as a dancing, prancing automat is weaved into combat, represented as quite remarkable move sets. It’s pretty cool to look at at!

                              <span>It takes a lot of guts to throw SteelRising into the Souls-like ring. It’s a popular arena, ever-growing over the last few years as more and more people dive into a genre known for intense action, a healthy challenge, and gruesome, fantastical worlds. If a game can set itself apart, like The Surge 2 or the Nioh series, history has shown the move to be worthwhile. But for every success story there are twice as many bombs, who couldn’t stand up to obvious and unavoidable comparisons to some of the best games released over the past decade. SteelRising, in my mind after a full playthrough and some change, doesn’t quite make the mark. 

Let’s start with what you likely already know. SteelRising is a third-person action game, where you adventure across several levels taking on an environment packed full of difficult enemies before encountering a gigantic boss posing a significant challenge. You have rechargeable healing items that are restored at set resting points, as well as a variety of consumables that aide in combat. Killing enemies provides currency which can, in turn, be used to upgrade your character and weaponry. It’s a Souls-like. Chances are if you’re reading this review, you know exactly what foundation Steel Rising is built upon. 
For what it’s worth, this foundation is fairly solid! Your movement as a French murder doll in the midst of combat has you weaving in-between attacks and string together powerful combos with a mix of regular, heavy, and special attacks. Put on enough pressure and you can break an enemy&#x27;s posture, allowing you to land a single devastating attack. Backstabs aren’t here, but are instead replaced with a universal sneak attack you can land on any and all unaware automata. If you’re fiending for some of that Dark Souls-esque action, feats like these do indeed cause your brain to shoot off those sweet signals.

I&#x27;m wholly impartial, of course, but I am glad you haven&#x27;t forced me to come up with some contrived reason to jam a really big unreal place back into the running. We can continue. This week, it&#x27;s a question of jarring vs. juicy. What&#x27;s better: physics freakouts or beautiful food?

                              <span>The musical mastermind behind Rivals and Family is back with a new game. Riley &amp; Rochelle follows the two titular talented musicians, former lovers and eventual superstars, while you as the player are tasked with uncovering the secrets of their lives to find the reveal them. With Tim Sheinman joining forces with writer Natalia Yanchak, Riley &amp; Rochelle continues the playstyle of Sheinman&#x27;s previous interactive puzzle games, where you traverse through muscical memories both good and bad. Take a look at the new reveal trailer below.


This time you&#x27;re cast as someone making a movie about Riley and Rochelle. You must extract truths from diary entries, voicemails and other characters to correctly put together the timeline. Use your knowledge, deductive skills and appreciation for “naughty” 90s culture to succeed. Prepare to correctly answer different quizzes (the screenshots show an Audio Quiz and a Fan Fiction quiz) to test your Riley and Rochelle knowledge in the game. You&#x27;ll even have to research real-life events to get to the bottom of things.
As with Sheinman&#x27;s other games, though, music is the real star. A big part of the game is listening to audio recordings and songs sung by Rochelle and Riley, original tracks written for the game, to ascertain where, if, and how their relationship will end.

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>3rd person skater/shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

                              <span>Chinese media giants Tencent have invested €300 million (£260 million) in the company operated by Ubisoft’s founding family, the Guillemots. The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Corecell came forward last week with the second accusation made by an indie team against PQube in less than a month, following A Space For The Unbound devs Mojiken Studio’s claims in late August. Both studios claim PQube withheld money from them.

                              <span>What sounds like the entire Assassin’s Creed line-up for Saturday’s Ubisoft Forward presentation may have been leaked online. Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

                              <span>Back in July I called attention to the issue how Linux 5.19 was set to break Alder Lake P graphics support unless moving to new graphics micro-controller &quot;GuC&quot; firmware in tandem. That user-space breakage is frowned upon and following that article the upstream DRM kernel maintainers outlined explicit requirements around firmware not breaking driver support. Intel engineers ended up submitting a quick fix for Linux 5.19 to still support the existing firmware while now a more adequate solution has been devised...</span>

                              <span>I have just deleted two forks I had of the GitLab project in my
gitlab.com account. I did this after receiving a warning that quotas
would now start to be enforced. It didn&#x27;t say that I was going over
quota, so I actually had to go look in the usage quotas page,
which stated I was using 5.6GB of storage.
I found that puzzling: maybe wallabako? I build images there in
CI... Or the ISOs in stressant?
Nope. The biggest disk users were... my forks of gitlab-ce and
gitlab-ee (now respectively called gitlab-foss and gitlab-ee,
but whatever). CE was taking up roughly 1GB and EE was taking up the
rest.
So I deleted both repos, which means that the next time I want to
contribute a fix to their documentation — which is as far as I managed
to contribute to GitLab — I will need to re-fork those humongous
repositories.
Maybe I&#x27;m reading this wrong. Maybe there&#x27;s a bug in the quotas
system. Or, if I&#x27;m reading this right, GitLab is actually
double-billing people: once for the source repository, and once for
the fork. Because surely repos are not duplicating all those blobs
on disk... right? RIGHT?
Either case, that&#x27;s rather a bad move on their part, I feel like. With
GitHub charging 4$/user/month, it feels like GitLab is going to
have to trouble to compete by charging 20$/user/month as a
challenger...
But maybe it&#x27;s just me: I&#x27;m not an economist, surely there&#x27;s some
brilliant plan here I&#x27;m missing...
In the meantime, free-ish alternatives include Quay.io (currently
free for public repos) and sr.ht (2$/mth, but at least not
open-core, unfortunately no plan for a container registry). And
of course, you can painfully self-host GitLab, sr.ht, gitea,
pagure, or whatever it is the current fancy gitweb.</span>

                              <span>During the first wave of RTX 3080 reviews, when we had no idea of the graphics card supply shortage to come, I remember being really impressed by the Asus Tuf Gaming model. It didn&#x27;t look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work. Now though, you can get the upgraded version of that high-performer at a more reasonable price: £650 for the Tuf Gaming OC V2, an overclocked model offering excellent performance for £400 below this model&#x27;s UK RRP.

America&#x27;s bad-ass actor dad played semi-imaginary rock anarchist (I know I&#x27;m being reductive, don&#x27;t leave comments) Johnny Silverhand in the main game, and he popped up to confirm he&#x27;s back for 2023&#x27;s expansion - which we now know is officially called Phantom Liberty.
There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th. See the great lumbering beast for yourself by watching the trailer below.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell. Let&#x27;s admire its gleaming reveal trailer below.

I&#x27;m planning road and neighbourhood layouts to optimise movement and happiness. I&#x27;m planning defences to fend off bandits. But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

                              <span>As PC setups are carefully packed away and booths are dismantled, the curtain closes on another PAX West and it&#x27;s time to say goodbye to Seattle (for now anyway). After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event. We list off our favourite panel moments, the best game demos we played, and our general opinion on how the overall convention went. Click play below to see one of our last videos from the event:

                              <span>Ahead of this weekend&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward digital showcase, a new report has claimed the event will offer a look at three previously unannounced Assassin&#x27;s Creed titles - one set in Japan, another in 16th century Europe, and a third in China.


Earlier this week, Ubisoft confirmed it would be &#x27;unveiling the future&#x27; of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise during this Saturday&#x27;s digital showcase, but stopped short of providing specifics. A look at the recently recently confirmed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage seemed a certainty, but a new report has suggested the publisher might in fact have a lot more its ready to share.


According to relentlessly leaky (and usually reliable) journalist Tom Henderson, writing for Try Hard Guides, Ubisoft Forward&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed portion will indeed begin with a &quot;deep dive&quot; into Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage.

                              <span>With God of War Ragnarök inching ever closer to its 9th November release on PlayStation, the pre-launch pre-amble keeps on coming, this time with a closer look at the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim in a new video.


Svartalfheim is, of course, one of the Nine Realms at the heart of God of War&#x27;s current Norse-themed saga, and one of three - alongside Vanaheim and Asgard - that were unreachable in the first game. Players will finally be able to complete the set in Ragnarök, though, as well as getting a chance to return to previously visited realms to explore new locations.


Svartalfheim, like other realms, can be accessed via the gateway located at the centre of the Lake of Nine (frozen over in Ragnarök thanks to the onset of Fimbulwinter) and - as detailed in a new GameInformer video - will present players with plenty of dwarven ingenuity to explore, including mine pits, artificial water channels, and sprawling cities.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol showed some gameplay to the public for the first time at Gamescom this year, with about three minutes of footage highlighting a bit of combat, a bit of stealth, and a slip-n-slide finish that ends with a bit of a crunch. Behind closed doors at the show, however, we saw a much longer version - albeit with the same stomach-churning finale - and had time to speak with the game&#x27;s director and studio head Glen Schofield.


Things begin with a jump - a scare as you open a door that then leads into a bit of one-on-one combat with one of The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s more standard enemies. The twist here is that enemies in The Callisto Protocol can mutate. After you engage them in combat some tentacles will start spurting out of their torso. Shooting or otherwise battering them in the tentacles will put them down faster, the mutation acting as a kind of weak spot, but miss your fairly short window and those enemies will evolve, gruesomely, into much more resilient, aggressive opposition. Dodging becomes important - there was a lot of ducking, diving, dipping and dodging in this demo - while you club away at them with a kind of riot baton in melee, although if more than one mutated enemy starts coming at you, you&#x27;ll struggle.


&quot;I think our combat is much more complex than we&#x27;ve made before,&quot; Schofield says, as opposed to how things were with the likes of Dead Space, this game&#x27;s spiritual predecessor and the series Schofield created. &quot;Especially with a sort of survival horror game - you&#x27;ve got a bunch of different weapons. I&#x27;ve always believed that survival horror doesn&#x27;t mean you would just have one bullet, right? Survival horror, I [think] means: I&#x27;ve got a clip, but I still can&#x27;t take them all out.&quot;

These images show a planned storyline similar to one seen in Angelina Jolie&#x27;s debut turn as Lara Croft, with Croft Manor being attacked by masked assailants.


Shared by artist Jake Lunt Davies, the images show Lara&#x27;s home on an atmospherically dark and stormy night. Meanwhile, in the grounds, several shady looking characters are depicted planning their infiltration of the manor.

                              <span>Mario Kart Tour has made Nintendo an estimated $293m globally to become the company&#x27;s second highest grossing mobile game.


That&#x27;s according to data from reliable app store analytics company Sensor Tower, from across both the App Store and Google Play store.


The estimates follow the recent news that Nintendo will remove gacha elements from Mario Kart Tour, which allow players to spend money on randomised rewards. This will be replaced by a rotating item shop.

But in one of the all time great Fahey pieces, he offered an even better description: &quot;I am a 6&#x27;6&quot; man with a vivid imagination and strange thought processes.&quot;


This is the Fahey that his readers truly knew - a gentle, sweet-natured giant with a brilliant mind and an eye for the angle that nobody else had thought of - a willingness to monitor a situation and just see where it went.


Fahey died last week at 49 after a long illness. He was a generous, ingenious, and kind writer whose posts always left you feeling happier - and more curious about things - than you had felt when you started reading them. He did indeed love snacks and toys and keyboards, of which he reviewed plenty. He loved video games, which he covered with perceptiveness, originality, and great care.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima struggled to get live-action clips in Metal Gear Solid, not for technical reasons but because of a lack of contacts.


In a series of tweets on his Japanese account, he shared some background information on the game celebrating the 35th anniversary of the series (thanks SiliconEra).


Kojima wanted to push the realism of his fictional story using real war footage and, of course, the PlayStation console was able to play compressed film so this wasn&#x27;t a technical limitation.

                              <span>The Sims has been around for 22 years now, with even the fourth, and most recent, numbered entry being a venerable eight years old. My first time playing the original was a communal experience in the sixth form common room, crowded around a friend&#x27;s laptop. We created a replica of said common room, populated it with facsimiles of friends and mostly left them to their own devices. One of them forgot where the toilet was and peed himself, then cried about it.


The Sims 2? Not sure if I even played it. I was 21 when it was released in 2004 and, like much of my life back then, the memories are a bit fuzzy.
Number three meanwhile was inspirational. Not so much the game itself, although many would say it&#x27;s the high point of the series, but the writing about it. Robin Burkinshaw&#x27;s &quot;Alice and Kev&quot;, a blog chronicling the adventures of a homeless Sim and his daughter, really struck a chord and inspired me to try my hand at something similar. (It was rubbish.)

                              <span>Last week I watched Il Buco, or The Hole, the latest film from the Italian director Michelangelo Frammartino. It&#x27;s mesmerising. With very little in the way of dialogue, Frammartino tells the story of a 1960s spelunking expedition that explored one of the deepest cave systems in the world.


At first glance Il Buco seems filled with slightly trite opposites. The expedition comes from the urban north of Italy to the bucolic south, and one scene shows a cluster of kids gathered around a TV set that&#x27;s broadcasting a news piece about the tallest building in the country, which is being constructed while the spelunkers are heading off in the opposite direction.


But all of this is a distraction, I think. Or rather, it felt like Frammartino was throwing things in to the movie to allow you to ruminate and begin the process of looking for meanings. The bulk of the film is concerned with a more engaging case of opposites: an elderly shepherd spending his last days with his flock, while that hole slowly reveals its depths.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is getting in the spirit of Talk Like a Pirate Day with a week of celebrations that&#x27;ll include the swashbuckling multiplayer adventure&#x27;s latest XP-boosting community event.


The general festivities begin on Thursday, 15th September (running until Tuesday, 20th September),  bringing a free Arrrgh! emote for anyone that logs in during the event, plus special Merchant Alliance fireworks, and discounts in the premium Pirate Emporium store. Additionally, players will be able to pick up a second free emote - Ranting Rogue - from the Pirate Emporium.


The main event, though, is Season Seven&#x27;s Community Day, running for 24 hours from 10am UTC on Sunday, 17th September. A &quot;generous&quot; Renown XP boost will be applied to all in-game activities for the duration, helping players work through this season&#x27;s progression track more easily, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a set of additional player-driven boosts via Twitter.

                              <span>Our local Debian user group gathered on Sunday August 28th1 at the very
hackish Foulab for the August 2022 edition of our &quot;Debian &amp; Stuff&quot;
meetings.
As always, the event was a success and we had lots of fun. Nine people showed
up, including some new faces and people I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while:
On my side, although I was badly sleep-deprived 2, I still managed to be
somewhat productive!
One of the WiFi Access Points we use in our 4-apartment LAN had been
boot-looping for a few weeks, after a failed sysupgrade to the latest version
of OpenWRT. lavamind and I suspect the flash got corrupted in a way or another
during the upgrade process...
Lucky for us, this model has a serial port and runs U-Boot. After a
bit of tinkering, some electrical tape and two different serial
adapters3, we managed to identify the pin layout and got a shell on the
machine. The device has a reset button, but since the kernel panic was
happening too soon in the boot process, we weren&#x27;t able to get into OpenWRT&#x27;s
failsafe mode this way.

Once we had serial access, wiping the flash and re-installing OpenWRT fixed our
problem. A quick ansible-playbook run later, the device was back to being
usable and configured :)
I was too tired to keep track of what others did, but I took some nice pictures
of the pizza we got, and of this nice blow-up Tux wearing a Foulab t-shirt. Enjoy!


As always, thanks to the Debian project for granting us a budget to rent the
venue and to buy some food.
Please excuse the late blog post, it&#x27;s Harvest Season here and I&#x27;ve been
  quite busy. ↩
A bad case of wry neck kept me from sleeping properly for a while in
  August. ↩
As it turns out, serial connections work better when you use the
  right pins for TX and RX! ↩</span>

Before I start, the game I was talking about is called Cell To Singularity. Now I haven’t gone much in the game as I have shared but think that the Singularity it refers to is the Technological Singularity that people think will happen. Whether that will happen or not is open to debate to one and all. This is going to be a bit long one. 
Confession Time :- When I was sharing in the blog post, I had no clue that we actually had sessions on it in this year’s Debconf. I just saw the schedule yesterday and then came to know. Then I saw Guido’s two talks, one at Debconf as well as one as Froscon. In fact, saw the Froscon talk first, and then the one at Debconf. Both the talks are nearly the same except for a thing here or a thing there.   
Now because I was not there so my understanding…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Borg backup for a couple of years and it has
seemingly worked very well for me. One difference I really appreciate from my
previous arrangement (rdiff-backup) is the freedom to move large
files or file hierarchies around (including between different filesystems)
without provoking large backup incrementals.
About a week ago I had my first real problem with Borg: backups started to
fail with the following complaints:
Creating archive at &quot;/backup/borg::{hostname}-home-jon-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}&quot;
segment 61916 not found, but listed in compaction data

                              <span>Ubisoft will host its Ubisoft Forward showcase this weekend, and it seems the company plans to announce multiple Assassin&#x27;s Creed projects.
The company has already promised to discuss Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage during the showcase, and it&#x27;s possible it will touch upon Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity as well. Ubisoft promised previously that additional information regarding &quot;the future&quot; of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise would be shared during Ubisoft Forward, and rumor has it the company will announce three more projects for the series.
According to Tom Henderson, the Assassin&#x27;s Creed games we will hear about have settings in Japan, 16th-century Europe during the witch hunts, and China.

                              <span>As we keep waiting for The Elder Scrolls 6 and – way before that – Starfield, us veteran Elder Scrolls fans keep wondering about where Bethesda might take the long-awaited sixth mainline entry of their big fantasy series. 
Of course, we are almost sure at this point about where it’s literally going: either High Rock or Hammerfell, maybe even both. But what about everything else? More importantly, what about the unavoidable rework of its moment-to-moment gameplay and RPG systems? And beyond those elements, how big can it reasonably be?
As I discussed in my previous The Elder Scrolls 6 speculation piece, most folks are looking at Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls Online to fantasize about the next game. And that’s not a mistake, especially if we consider the ridiculous amount of Skyrim re-releases we’ve had in little more than a decade; that game is hugely important for Bethesda Game Studios. Even though Oblivion made the franchise mainstream thanks to its key role as one of Xbox 360’s early must-plays, Skyrim’s shadow is nearly impossible to escape and has shaped the entire open-world genre, RPG or not.

                              <span>CD Projekt RED has released a teaser trailer for the first expansion to Cyberpunk 2077.
Titled Phantom Liberty, it&#x27;s described as a spy-thriller expansion that will be set in an all-new district of Night City.
Not much is shown in the teaser trailer, but the country looks like it&#x27;s in trouble. As far as the storyline is concerned, well, the teaser doesn&#x27;t give us much in the way of that either.

                              <span>Mario Kart Tour is a rather popular mobile game for Nintendo, so much so that it has generated around $293 million for the company.
This is according to Sensor Tower (thanks GI.biz), which reports the figure was generated within three years of launch.
It is a rather popular game, and during its first week of availability, Mario Kart Tour topped 20 million downloads across Android and iOS worldwide.

                              <span>Have you ever sat and listened to the bass riff in MGMT’s Electric Feel? I don’t think I ever realised, really, how integral to the song that little refrain is; the entire track is based around it! Ignore those hateful lyrics (hey, they’re a joke band, it’s fine), drink in those festival vibes, and let that bass sink into you… you feel it? Electric Feel is all about bass, I think. Why have I never learned to play that riff before? Well, I guess I’d never had someone show me how. 

Not until I was browsing the catalogues available at launch on Rocksmith+ and saw it there, nestled amongst things like Snarky Puppy’s excellent jam-rock meanderer, ‘Shofukan’, and The Eurhythmics’ seminal ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)’. I was alive in the 00s, I’ve definitely been in some shit Midlands club singing along to Electric Feel – why not plug in my bass, and give it a go.
Turns out, that riff is one of the most fun-to-play things I’ve committed to since picking up my bass guitar at the start of the year. I’ve only been playing the bass for nine months now, and whilst there are some transferable skills from my 17 years of guitar playing, there’s also a lot of new stuff to digest. Rocksmith+ not only gives me a fun new song to play – all mapped out, delicious, and easy-to-read with a genuinely intuitive UI – but it also identifies areas I might be struggling with and ushes me towards improving.

                              <span>There’s a new ad for God of War Ragnarok, featuring both Rick and Morty in a crossover I can safely say I wasn’t ready to see today. The game, launching on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on November 9 takes place in a mystical norse world filled with gods and monsters, one which the duo visited briefly all for the sake of a shiny new axe and a few gags.
The ad itself does, admittedly, have a few jokes that made me giggle. Rick drunkenly summarising the base plot of many AAA narrative action adventures like God of War as journeys to make choices and face the consequences, as well as opening a massive golden chest to find the leviathan axe and “other unannounced upgrades” was just meta enough to get me on board.
This isn’t the first crossover ad Rick and Morty have been a part of. Back in 2020, American fast food restaurant Wendy’s partnered with Rick and Morty to promote some of their breakfast menu, with humanoid breakfast baconator, honey chicken biscuits and an frosty-ccino rushing down and attacking the pair with pipes and bats. Fun stuff.

                              <span>Deltarune, the episodic pixel-art RPG from beloved creator Toby Fox, won’t have a new chapter release this year. This information comes straight from the creator himself, who posted an update on Twitter conveying the news to his 1.3 million followers.
While this is of course sad news for those eager to experience more Deltarune as soon as possible, there’s some chaser good news that you can swallow. With the one-year anniversary of Deltarune chapter 2 coming up soon, Toby Fox has teased something special next week.
As far as we know, development on Deltarune continues to go smoothly, with Toby Fox posting as much back in May and stating: “I&#x27;m getting more and more people to help recently, I have good feelings about it”, something that’s obviously great to see for fans of Fox’s continued output.

                              <span>Developer of Phasmophobia, Kinetic Games, is no stranger to updates and keeping players in the loop regarding them. The ghost-hunting game has been in Early Access for almost two years now, and it continues to get better each month as Kinetic liaises with its community.
That said, Kinetic has listened once more to the thoughts and feedback of players and will soon be introducing a Custom Difficulty update to Phasmophobia.
The previous roadmap shared for Phasmophobia didn&#x27;t go so swimmingly, but not so much so that players were in turmoil over it. Kinetic says in their latest development preview via Steam, &quot;Things didn&#x27;t exactly go to plan! Originally the VR overhaul was planned to release earlier than April, allowing us to get knee-deep into Custom Difficulty&#x27;s development. As it took longer, we pushed Custom back a couple of months and gave the community three smaller patches of content to fill the gap in content.&quot;

                              <span>It’s that time again - another video game world is under consideration by the design team at Lego, with a chance to become an official Lego product in stores the world over. This time, it’s a strong fit for brick-built worlds - with Terraria getting the Lego treatment.


The Terraria set comes through Lego Ideas, a project ran by the Lego Group that allows fans to submit set designs and ideas to the company. Any set that garners 10,000 supporters in the Lego Ideas community gets sent up to a board of Lego designers and employees, who then assess the set’s suitability for a final release. If they decide to pick it up, it’ll later appear as a real-life set, in real-life shops, no longer just a fan creation, but made official.


Making it to a final product from Lego Ideas is a particularly long shot, but the Terraria set has cleared the first major hurdle. In the realm of video games, both Lego Minecraft and Lego Sonic the Hedgehog began life as Lego Ideas submissions. In the case of Minecraft, a one-off Ideas set ultimately led to an entire series of Minecraft sets which are still going strong with new releases to this day.

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>The first gameplay footage of Katana Zero&#x27;s free DLC expansion has finally sliced its way onto the internet. Developer Askiisoft released a near-ten minute slice of the DLC&#x27;s first level over the weekend, showing off some of the ultraviolent delights we can expect to see when it eventually comes out. Have a watch of the level in full below (and apologies in advance to Jim, whose birthday wish of escaping any surprise intruders on his special day goes very much unheard).

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software&#x27;s upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won&#x27;t have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

                              <span>A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games&#x27; Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

They’re appropriately blurry, considering the series&#x27; penchant for mistiness, but still recognisably Silent Hill. Once again, it’s claimed that the game is being developed by Layers Of Fear studio Bloober Team.

Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes. Watch below for the entire interview.

                              <span>Kinetic Games has released an updated development roadmap for its deliciously spooky ghost hunting sim Phasmophobia, with the game&#x27;s custom difficulty feature now set to release this month with plenty more on the way.


As Kinetic explains in a new Steam post, the team has now revised its early access roadmap for 2022 and beyond to &quot;more accurately represents what we achieved this year, and what we plan to do moving forwards&quot; following a longer-than-expected development period for Phasmophobia&#x27;s VR rework, which eventually arrived in April.


Kinetic has released some smaller updates since then to keep players appropriately terrified but it&#x27;s all go in September with the advent of Phasmophobia&#x27;s Custom Difficulty update, which the developers says is &quot;a big one&quot;.

                              <span>The Torchlight series is returning - although this time as a free-to-play game for PC, iPhone and Android devices.


An early Steam version of the game is available to download now, as part of a closed beta test before a full launch next month, some time in October. (You can request access via its Steam page.)


There&#x27;s a whiff of Diablo Immortal to Torchlight Infinite, which has numerous ways to spend money within the game. Monetisation will include a season pass, monthly pass, auction house and premium currency bundles. Spending and progress will be reset at the end of the current beta, though the amount you spend will then be granted back when the game fully arrives.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s DF Direct is somewhat different than the usual show - a while back, Intel approached us, asking to be featured on a future episode to talk about its Arc graphics line. At the same time, Intel Fellow Tom Petersen, having seen our extensive image quality comparisons in our FSR 2.0 God of War video, was also keen to see the firm&#x27;s own XeSS machine learning-based upscaling technology put through its paces in a similarly rigorous fashion. That work is still ongoing and due later this week, but today I&#x27;m pleased to share the DF Direct Intel special, filmed in Berlin last week - not least because it sees Petersen addressing all of the concerns we&#x27;ve had about Arc over the last few months. 


I&#x27;d recommend watching the video through because we&#x27;ve got a lot of ground to cover, kicking…</span>

The console will release on 27th October and the included 60 titles from both the Mega Drive and Mega CD consoles have now been fully revealed, including two that were previously unreleased.

As reported last month, the console will have a tenth of the supply compared to the previous retro console in North America, so stocks are expected to be limited.

Created by SpaceDasher, the mod lets you choose between Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello or Michelangelo to swing around as. Or maybe that should be swim around as?

One such discussion taking place focuses on a potential new IP from Naughty Dog, that many believe will have a fantasy theme. This all started after several posters with fantasy-like elements were spotted adorning the game&#x27;s walls.


The posters in question, which can be seen below, show images of a Pegasus-like horse, a dragon, and a female warrior:

The mod comes from MaxTheMiracle, and reskins the player with Sauron&#x27;s black armour and  humanoid figure seen in the likes of Peter Jackson&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings film adaptations (but without that imposing height).


This mod is still in its early days, but has been released to coincide with Amazon&#x27;s Rings of Power series. As such, the current weapon moveset used within this mod is borrowed from another mod, as work on it continues behind the scenes.

Speaking at PAX West last week, Booty discussed the increased prevalence of multiple developers working together on new games.


&quot;How we make games is evolving,&quot; said Booty. &quot;The idea of a single team under one roof really doesn&#x27;t happen that often anymore.&quot;

Crash&#x27;N&#x27;Dance is being developed by indie dev Fierce the Bandit, who posted a short video of their current progress.

The fan-made project is a rhythm game where players must hit button prompts in time to the music. Fake Crash will pop up on the screen sporadically in an attempt to distract you, but if you&#x27;re successful, Crash will perform his signature boogie and get a shiny crystal.

This update went live over the weekend, and also added an in-game account linking option.
However, despite being labelled as a &quot;quality of life&quot; update, this move by publisher 2K has left some fans unhappy, with several stating the game is now broken.

The store page also hosts various screenshots of the under-wraps shooter, and describes it as a &quot;free-to-play survival-action multiplayer shooter set in small-town Middle America&quot;.

                              <span>Ghostwire: Toyko is one of the exceedingly small number of video games that I&#x27;ve been bothered to grab all the trophies for. It wasn&#x27;t a fun Platinum either as, after about 10 hours in, the game gets rather repetitive and the trophy hunt becomes an absolute mind-numbing grind for collectibles. 
So why did I do I bother then? You might be thinking. Well, simply put, I absolutely loved the look and the feel of Tango Gameworks&#x27; version of Shibuya. The way the rain soaked streets reflect the neon signs is mesmerising to me. The gloriously detailed environments makes it feel like you really are in a real, living city in the moments after its inhabitants were spooky-raptured. It&#x27;s such a beautiful space to inhabit and as a bit of a Japanophile who recently spent his honeymoon wandering around parts of Shibuya that feature in the game, playing Ghostwire: Tokyo is also a great way to soak up the vibe of the city and indulge in some memories of my trip.
But now, thanks to an upcoming mod from master VR modder Luke Ross, I&#x27;m able to experience the world of Ghostwire: Tokyo like I was actually there and it&#x27;s by far my most preferred way to play the game. Want to see what all the fuss is about? You can watch me lose my mind over petting Shiba Inu&#x27;s in VR in this week&#x27;s VR Corner (below).

Retro Studios - the developer behind the Metroid Prime series - was long-rumoured to have worked on a canned Zelda game and in 2020 concept art of the project was discovered.



Now, YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming has uncovered more information about the project.

                              <span>In anticipation of God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s release, a new promo starring Rick and Morty has been revealed.
American adult-oriented nighttime cable television channel Adult Swim shared the new ad on its Rick and Morty social feeds. The clip shows eccentric scientist Rick shaving his head and branding himself with Kratos&#x27; iconic red facial tattoo. He then proceeds to hand his grandson Morty a toy bow and arrow, before shoving him through a portal to the Nine Realms.
Here, Rick gets his hands on Kratos&#x27; Leviathan Axe and &quot;other unannounced upgrades&quot; as Morty tries to fend for himself (rather unsuccessfully) in the hostile world he suddenly finds himself in. It ends with Rick finding a boat, informing the overpowered Morty that he will have to row as Rick doesn&#x27;t want to get his new axe wet. You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>A new Elden Ring manga reimagines the game as a comedy.


Or maybe your playthrough was a comedy all along? There&#x27;s certainly a farcical element to all the constant dying.


The manga comes courtesy of Kadokawa - FromSoftware&#x27;s parent company and a huge publisher of manga.

                              <span>Jack Move. Jack Move. Here is a phrase that tickles somewhere, deep in the back of the brain, buried under boxes and old coats. Wasn&#x27;t someone...down for a Jack Move? I want to say William Gibson. One of the early ones - or maybe one of the present-day ones?


Googling will have to wait, because here is Jack Move, with a demo out on Steam now and a release planned for the 8th of September. Turns out we&#x27;re all down for a Jack Move.


And I reckon I was right about Gibson, because Jack Move is a cyberpunk JRPG, albeit one with modern sensibilities, which means the pixel-art is smooth and Treasure-textured and the action is implausibly brisk. Straight up: this is a lovely thing. Lovely from the way that you PATCH items rather than use them, to the way that you have stats for Sass and Guts and Grok.

                              <span>You aren&#x27;t alone in wanting a new Fable trailer, as Microsoft Studios head Matt Booty wants to show it off, but Playground Games is understandably not quite ready yet. 
The new Fable was revealed back in 2020, but as with many games these days, it was a cinematic trailer, so no gameplay to speak of. Who knows where it might be in development, but based on what Booty has said recently on a panel at PAX West, it still needs some more time in the metaphorical oven.
&quot;Part of my job is giving air cover to the team,&quot; Booty explained. &quot;They don&#x27;t want to show stuff early before it&#x27;s ready to go, but if there&#x27;s one game where that&#x27;s kind of flipped around, where every time I see something I say, &#x27;We should show this&#x27;, it&#x27;s Fable. Because there&#x27;s a lot of cool stuff.&quot;

                              <span>Rare’s legendary N64 first-person shooter, Goldeneye, marked its 25th anniversary last month. However, at the risk of raising blood pressure worldwide, I’ll dare to say that it’s not the jewel in the British developer’s FPS crown. That accolade goes to its spiritual successor: Perfect Dark.

With the announcement of a series reboot at The Game Awards in 2020, Microsoft’s newest studio, The Initiative, has been given the momentous task of bringing the franchise to modern audiences, with a little help from Tomb Raider industry veterans Crystal Dynamics. Ignoring for a moment that The Initiative sounds concernedly like one of the shady organisations that Joanna Dark would be taking down, the new triple-A studio has its work cut out in creating a debut title that manages to deliver the nostalgia that long-time series fans will want, as well as enough modernity to satisfy new players — something that Rare failed to do with Perfect Dark Zero back in 2005. If they want to be in with a shot of satisfying both audiences, they’ll need to learn from Rare’s mistakes.

Firstly, we need a cool-as-heck story. Very little has been shared about the reboot so far, but the cinematic trailer confirms the theme of ecological disaster. We see Earth from space, rife with storms, fires, and floods. We’re told of corporations offering “solutions”, but series fans will know that corporations have long played complex roles in Perfect Dark’s lore. We also know by the end of the trailer that dataDyne is still a featured antagonist, as the camera pans across dead soldiers to show Joanna standing atop a dataDyne super-structure, looking out over a storm ravaging the Great Pyramids. Setting itself deeply within the fictional side of sci-fi, Perfect Dark has always played with the idea of an alternative future.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 1 is out and firmly in the hands of players across the world. A great overhaul of an already brilliant game (as per our review), many are jumping in and scouring the world in Joel’s shoes once again. However, a secret recently found in this new version of the Naughty Dog 3rd person classic has some curious about the next big IP from the studio.
In the new game, players can track down and take a look at pin boards inside a pitch-black building. With the help of a flashlight, you can see several pieces of fantastical art featuring dragons, a variety of fantasy characters, and other mystical creatures and settings.
Now, there’s been no word on what the team at Naughty Dog are working on next, aside from the Last of Us multiplayer title they teased earlier this year. However, the studio has a history if littering their games with hints towards future titles. Uncharted 3 famously featured an easter egg pointing towards The Last of Us before its official reveal, so the likelihood that this is a similar situation isn’t nil.

                              <span>Even though split-screen co-op has been cancelled for Halo Infinite, players have worked out a way that lets them do it anyway.
Last week, 343 Industries provided a roadmap for Halo Infinite that promised players the Forge and Campaign co-op would be coming in November. Only downside is that split-screen co-op had been cancelled in the process, obviously leaving some players that were hoping to live out their youth once more disappointed. But it seems that some players have found a bit of a workaround thanks to a menu glitch.
As spotted by Eurogamer, French Halo community Halo Creation shared a video that shows a menu glitch that allows you to play the game in split-screen co-op. The Twitter account for the community has shared a helpful video of the glitch in action, which was discovered by Halo player Alexis B., and all the steps you need to follow.

                              <span>The game might not be out until the end of the week, but plenty of Splatoon 3 gameplay is already appearing online.
Street dates of games can often be broken by a day or so, whether it comes to a delivery service just getting a package somewhere early, or a store being a bit cheeky and letting a friend buy a copy a day early. Unfortunately for Nintendo, a tonne of gameplay has already leaked online just under a week before the game is out week, September 9.
As spotted by Kotaku, gameplay has been appearing all over the Splatoon subreddit, though the subreddit is removing any posts that shows anything that hasn&#x27;t been previously revealed in an official capacity, considering that it would technically be a spoiler. This is the subreddit&#x27;s general rule for spoilers anyway, so if you&#x27;re worried about visiting the subreddit post-release, there shouldn&#x27;t be any spoilers to be found.

                              <span>Some new details have emerged on Retro Studios&#x27; cancelled Zelda game that would have starred Sheik as the main character.
Retro Studios is best known for the Metroid Prime series these days, but did you know that at one point in time it was working on a Zelda game that would have put Sheik in the leading role? Did You Know Gaming knows, and it has recently put out a video spoke with one of the programmers that worked on the project.
Concept art for the game was released back in 2020, with the game supposedly intending to have more of a darker tone that would tell an origin story of the Master Sword, set in a timeline where Link fails to beat Ganon in Ocarina of Time. As a result of that artwork being released, programmer Paul Tozour was willing to talk about it, as well as an anonymous source, though it didn&#x27;t sound like a great game.

Supermassive Games first became renowned for Until Dawn, even winning a BAFTA award for the narrative-driven slasher game. Then came The Dark Pictures Anthology, a series of smaller, episodic narrative horror tales for players to embark on. 
Most recently, however, was The Quarry; another full-blown teen slasher in the form of a cinematic game, well worth the 4/5 we gave it in our review.

                              <span>The lead up to World of Warcraft’s Wrath of the Lich King Classic launch is well underway, with pre-patch servers up and running for close to a week now. This, in theory, lets players jump in and gear up a new character in preparation for our adventure to the frozen north, but humongous queue times across several servers have made this difficult for some players to get their adventure started in earnest.
This issue is affecting two types of servers present in Classic WoW. The first are the long-standing servers that have maintained a large population since Classic first launched back in 2019, like Grobbulus in the EU region. However, newly-created Fresh servers are also suffering. These new servers allow everyone to start playing totally empty-handed with others, without inflated economies or pre-existing fortunes muddying things.
Frustration and a healthy amount of joking around the topic can be found in heaps. Looking at the Classic WoW Reddit, numerous posts from players expressing their doomer outlook on the situation are present, listing out exorbitant queue times for their chosen servers, as well as some taking the plunge into less popular servers in order to kick their levelling journey into gear.

                              <span>Elden Ring is full of hidden areas, obscure bosses, and entire communities you may not get to see if you don&#x27;t venture too far off the beaten path. One of the more unique are the Ancestral Followers, who can be found deep underground in the Siofra River Bank.
The Followers worship the Ancestor Spirits, and can be seen gathering around its remains performing their rites. By following a simple mini-game, you can travel to the realm of the Ancestor Spirit and take it on in a boss fight.
All that is well and good, but the fight itself plays quite differently from all the other fights in Elden Ring. Most players who fought the Ancestor Spirit bosses in the game felt that they got a slightly different experience from the rest.

The images are reportedly shots - albeit very poor-quality ones - of an upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake from Bloober Team.
Now, we’re aware that Bloober Team are working with Konami given that the pair entered a partnership during summer last year. Just a month following that announcement, rumours began to emerge that Bloober Team was working on a new Silent Hill title.
Bloober’s CMO, Tomasz Galikowski, took part in an interview with IGN to clear the rumours up. Although, he ultimately left fans with more questions. The CMO told IGN that Bloober had applied for two projects with Konami, respectively codenamed Dum Spiro and Black.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the dawn of day three here at  PAX West, and what better way to wake us up than play the incredibly chaotic demo build of
 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang&#x27;s blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we&#x27;ve seen here at PAX so far.
If you&#x27;ve not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game&#x27;s trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game&#x27;s development.

It&#x27;s now the weekend so the show floor was significantly busier, but not enough to keep us from getting our mitts on some games. That&#x27;s right, we actually played some games today!
Have a click on the video below were we break down the day&#x27;s activities and also to see us get booted out from the show floor when it closed at 7. Here&#x27;s today&#x27;s daily round-up:

                              <span>Today&#x27;s PAX West interview is with the one and only Ron Gilbert, series creator of the iconic point-and-click adventure series, Monkey Island. We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island&#x27;s world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game&#x27;s story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won&#x27;t wanna miss that.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz&#x27;s Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn&#x27;t anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game&#x27;s angry robot lads that roamed the city&#x27;s blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware&#x27;s horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

                              <span>Konami&#x27;s much-talked about &quot;unannounced game&quot; could be a new Suikoden title.

A renewed trademark for the game – filed back in July, but only recently spotted – has popped up in Mexico, leading some to speculate that if Konami&#x27;s upcoming TGS spot doesn&#x27;t involve Castlevania, Metal Geat Solid, or Silent Hill, then it just may be about a new installment of the classic RPG series.

The filing – spotted by posters on Reddit and shared at ResetEra – tells us that the filing was made at the end of July and… well, not much else, actually. But it&#x27;s certainly coincidental timing, isn&#x27;t it, particularly as the last main Suikoden title released way back in 2006.

                              <span>Earlier this week, 343 Industries confirmed that split-screen local co-op in Halo Infinite has been cancelled outright - so players are now doing it themselves. 

&quot;In order to improve and accelerate ongoing live service development - and to better address player feedback and quality of life updates - we have reallocated studio resources and are no longer working on local campaign split-screen co-op,&quot; 343 said at the time, dashing the hopes of players who&#x27;d been patiently waiting to couch co-op the campaign with pals.

Now, however, it seems that players have found a menu glitch that permits them to add up to three additional local co-op players to their system; all you need is an Xbox Series S or X and a pal online, and this helpful walkthrough.

                              <span>Fan-favourite League of Legends animated spin-off Arcane has won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.

The show beat The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, What If…?, and Bob&#x27;s Burgers to secure the award. It is the first streaming series to win in that category.

&quot;Honoured doesn’t even begin to describe how we feel about winning the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program,&quot; the show&#x27;s official Twitter account posted earlier today.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent the last week playing Saints Row on last-gen PS4 and Xbox One systems - and honestly? It&#x27;s really not that bad. The fundamental technological issues remain: the glaring shadow pop-in is back - and actually a bit worse here. The buggy NPC animations and physics return too. Of course, the 60fps target of the PS5 and Series X versions gives way to something worse - a sub-40fps frame-rate or even sub-30 in stress-test scenarios. Performance is still unlocked too, when a 30fps cap really would have made a positive difference, but I went into this one with low expectations, which the last-gen versions comfortably exceed. 


Similar to Xbox Series S, the wealth of performance mode variations seen in the Series X and PS5 releases are gone. There are no graphics toggles of any kind. On top of that, ray tracing features are absent, of course, but that&#x27;s fine. There seem to be fixed pixel counts on all systems with no obvious dynamic resolution scaling, but what is interesting is how the HUD overlay actually does seem to change res. It&#x27;s very, very odd. In-game DRS can&#x27;t be entirely ruled out, but the game looks consistent in terms of image quality, with only the flickering HUD giving any sense of a resolution change.


Looking at the qualities of the last-gen versions, you&#x27;d expect Xbox One X to deliver the best rendition of the game - but that&#x27;s only partly true here. At least in image quality, you&#x27;re getting a very decent turn-out here at a native 2560x1440, up from the less than stellar 1080p on PlayStation 4 Pro. The One X&#x27;s 1440p also trumps Series S&#x27;s full HD output - but quality settings are dialled back (particularly in terms of foliage density) and the unlocked performance level is actually worse than the PS4 Pro experience. With that being the case, there&#x27;s no real &#x27;winner&#x27; here in terms of the last-gen machines as while the One X looks significantly cleaner, frame-rates can hit a 24fps nadir - Pro is smoother overall, if far from the smooth and consistent in its delivery.

                              <span>The Mortuary Assistant is the latest video game to be getting the silver screen treatment. 

The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched at the beginning of August - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month. 

Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a &quot;companion piece&quot; to the game, and Kipp hopes to &quot;retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay&quot;.

                              <span>Another day, another alleged Silent Hill leak. This one purports to be of Bloober Team&#x27;s alleged Silent Hill 2 remake.  

They&#x27;re incredibly small and incredibly bad quality, which means they&#x27;re impossible to confirm either way with any credible veracity, but the poster shared the images with the legend: &quot;First leaked image of Silent Hill 2 Remake supposedly developed by Bloober Team&quot;.

As for what they show? We seem to be looking at a third-person POV with the camera behind the left shoulder rather than a fixed angle. The third is the most compelling - it appears to be a bubble head nurse and reminds me of Brookhaven Hospital, when the nurse jumps out from near the elevator - whereas the top is reminiscent of the leaked concept art images we saw a few months back.

While currently only available to pre-order in Japan – sorry; we&#x27;ll let you know if and when it becomes available in Europe and beyond – the collection is currently up for sale on Amazon.co.jp, with each book priced at ¥4400 - that&#x27;s approximately £27 or £55 for the pair.

According to Famitsu (thanks, PC Gamer), a collector&#x27;s edition which includes both books and a framed Godfrey print is also available for ¥17,600, which is £108. It all comes in a &quot;special three-sided box&quot;.

                              <span>If you have a spare cool mill laying around somewhere, and fancy upping your console collection, there&#x27;s an eBay listing you might want to check out.
With the world of video games offering a fair number of rare collectibles due to limited prints of cartridges, or certain consoles and peripherals not doing well enough to warrant much production of them, there&#x27;s a lot of collectors in turn who like to build personal libraries. And recently, an eBay listing (spotted by Consolevariations.com) shows a pretty impressive collection of roughly 2400 different consoles. And all the seller wants for it is €984,000, which is about a million US dollars, or £850,000.
The auction looks legitimately impressive. Images show a Japanese and (presumably) European version of the Pokemon themed N64, a deliciously burnt orange GameCube, a PSP Go, and so much more. Seriuosly, it is a ridiculuosly large collection that honestly could be worth the asking price. The user in question, kariaure, has even shared videos of their collection on their YouTube channel, with an extensive range of Sega consoles,  Game Boys, and more shown off.

                              <span>It looks like the next music act to possibly have a collaboration with Fortnite is none other than Lady Gaga.
According Fortnite Twitter account and leaker FNLeaksAndInfo, &quot;a new collaborative emote&quot; was added with a recent update called &quot;Jug Band,&quot; and when four players come together to perform it, a song plays that sounds very similar to Lady Gaga&#x27;s song Poker Face, as reported by GameSpot.
FNLeaksAndInfo then posted a follow-up tweet sharing the audio in question, and yeah, it sure does sound like Poker Face, although more of a southern American, country bumpkin take on the pop song rather than the original.

                              <span>Elden Ring has received an official manga adaptation, only it&#x27;s more of a comedy manga than you might expect.
If you didn&#x27;t know, Elden Ring is a very funny game. How could it not be, with the endless number of ridiculous ways you could die. But the tone of everything else is generally pretty serious. That&#x27;s what makes the announcement of an official comedy Elden Ring manga a little bit of a surprise, even if it is a welcome one.
The manga is being hosted on ComicWalker where you can already read the first two chapters for free, and has art from Nikiichi Tobita, with the story obviously adapted from Elden Ring itself. It starts much the same as the game&#x27;s opening slideshow does, with lovingly rendered drawings based on the original art. But from the first proper page, you&#x27;ll be met with a surprise: ass.

                              <span>According to Prey director Raphaël Colantonio, Arkane Studios was forced by Bethesda to use the name, even though him not wanting to.
If you haven&#x27;t heard of Prey, first released in 2017, that&#x27;s not particularly surprising, as it didn&#x27;t do very well (though it is one of Arkane&#x27;s best games). There was also a game released in 2006 also called Prey, made by Human Head Studios, which Bethesda owns the IP rights to. And so despite the more recent title having nothing to do with the original, it uses the name, and according to a recent interview with Prey 2017&#x27;s director, it wasn&#x27;t anyone at Arkane&#x27;s decision to use the name.
&quot;Calling Prey Prey, that was very very hurtful to me. I did not want to call this game Prey, and I had to say I wanted to anyway in front of journalists,&quot; Colantonio said on the AIAS Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook podcast (thanks, Kotaku). &quot;There is a bit of the artistic, the creative side that is insulted when you tell this artist: &#x27;You know your game? It&#x27;s going to be called Prey.&#x27; And you go like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think it should. I think it&#x27;s a mistake.&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>Diablo Immortal players are finding themselves with big in-game debts after purchasing orbs from third-party sites.
As spotted by PCGamesN, players are reporting that they are being left with massive in-game debts after purchasing Eternal Orbs, one of the primary currencies in Diablo Immortal, through third-party websites. These orbs are being supposedly revoked by Blizzard, likely due to the fact that orbs cost real-world money.
A number of different posts on Diablo Immortal&#x27;s subreddit are making the claim, saying that they own massive amounts of orbs in the game to make up for what they haven&#x27;t paid for in game. It can cost £0.89 for 60 orbs, going up to as much as £89.99 for 7200 orbs. Whereas one post notes that third-party sites are selling 7200 orbs for as little as roughly £8.69 ($10).

                              <span>According to a recent report, Microsoft plans to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;several more years&quot; past the marketing deal the latter currently has with Activision.
This comes from The Verge, which recently received a statement from head of Xbox Phil Spencer. &quot;In January, we provided a signed agreement to Sony to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract, an offer that goes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements,&quot; wrote Spencer in the statement.
It had already been noted that the next three Call of Duty games would launch on PlayStation, which obviously includes the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Presuming that Activision keeps up the yearly releases of the series, that means there will be Call of Duty games on PlayStation until at least 2024, and now, further beyond that.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company is suing multiple Chinese mobile game operators over a game that allegedly looks a bit too much like Pokémon, Pocket Monster Reissue.
As reported by South China Morning Post (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), The Pokémon Company is taking legal action against six Chinese companies over copyright infringement and unfair competition behaviour, due to some striking similarities between Pokémon and Pocket Monster Reissue, also known as Koudaiyaoguai Fuke.
Apparently the six companies in question have been running the game since 2015, based on a stock exchange filing from Jiangyin Zhongnan Heavy Industries Co, one of the defendants. In turn, The Pokémon Company has put in a request at the Shenzhen Intermediate People&#x27;s Court looking to have an order placed against the six companies to prevent them from working on Pocket Monster Reissue.

The breakout hit that mixed Halo and Portal will no longer have any feature updates, but while this marks the end of one game, it also marks the start of another. In a statement provided on Twitter, 1047 Games explained its decision to stop development on Splitgate, while also reassuring fans that its next game will also be a shooter with portals.
&quot;After careful consideration and much deliberation the 1047 Games team has determined that in order to build the game fans deserve - and to build it in a way that isn&#x27;t trying to retrofit and live operate an existing product - we are ending feature development of Splitgate,&quot; reads the announcement.

A tweet posted by the official Gearbox account links to a week-long auction which currently features 47 lots. At the time of writing, all have active bids on them, although it&#x27;s impossible how much for, as every one is a &quot;blind bid&quot;.

&quot;Gearbox fans may have noticed the loud shirts worn by our head honcho over the years,&quot; Gearbox tweeted. &quot;Now these shirts can be yours!

                              <span>Apex Legends has set another record, setting a new minimum daily peak count of 329,041 players on Steam last month.

As that only reflects the number of players on Steam and doesn&#x27;t account for the thousands of players hot-dropping on console, too, it&#x27;s a significant milestone for Respawn&#x27;s fan-favourite battle royale, and is further bolstered by the shooter&#x27;s recently revised concurrent player peak, which was also broken earlier this month.

As evidenced on SteamDB and spotted by PCGN, in July, the minimum daily peak was 311,275, but in August jumped to 329,041 players.
