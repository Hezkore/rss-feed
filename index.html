                              <span>PGA Tour 2K23 has unveiled what golf pros will be playable when the sports sim releases next month.

From launch, the pros available include, in PGA Tour 2K23&#x27;s ordering: Tiger Woods, Justin Thomas, Lexi Thompson, Lydia Ko, Brooke Henderson, Will Zalatoris, Collin Morikawa, Tony Finau, Jon Rahm, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele, and &quot;more&quot;.

&quot;Each pro is decked out in true-to-life attire and gear, and features a unique set of attributes representative of their skill set,&quot; 2K says. &quot;Players can step into the tee box as one of the pros in Exhibition, Multiplayer and Divot Derby play, or go head-to-head with them in a battle to climb the leaderboard and claim the FedExCup in PGA Tour MyCareer mode.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been six months since the release of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s 1.5 update - the milestone patch that finally added native support for current generation consoles. CD Projekt RED has not been idle though, the new 1.6 &#x27;Edgerunners&#x27; update arrived last week, tying in with the new anime. A raft of new content features are added, but the focus of this piece is on a brand-new Xbox Series S performance mode, along with optimisations to the 30fps ray tracing mode on PS5 and Series X, where long-standing complaints about high input lag are finally addressed. Going into this one, we had two separate objectives - to put Series S&#x27;s new 60 frames per second mode through its paces and also to quantify the latency improvements on the more powerful consoles. 
Until the arrival of the new patch, Series S only ran at a capped 30fps at a dynamic 1440p resolution, going down to 2304x1296 lowest via dynamic scaling. There was no mode toggle like on PS5 or Series X - no option to choose between quality and performance. Adding to the disappointment, Series S had no option for ray-traced shadows either. Patch 1.6 doesn&#x27;t add the RT features, but at least the option to switch between fidelity and frame-rate is there.
Quality mode on Series S today works pretty much just as it did before the patch, in its default mode: it runs the gamut from 1440p down to around 1296p, with a reasonably tight 30fps lock with consistent frame-pacing. The new performance mode - inevitably - degrades some settings. In terms of pixel metrics, we&#x27;re looking at a range of 1080p at peak, going down to 800p lowest, most obvious in the areas where the game can&#x27;t stick to its 60fps target. As ever, CDPR&#x27;s engine also uses a form of TAA and reconstruction to produce a final 1080p resolve.

                              <span>Disney has confirmed that the next game to be plucked from the archives and given the remaster treatment will be Gargoyles.

As confirmed at The Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, Empty Clip will be taking on the 27-year-old platformer and updating it to join &quot;revived classics like The Jungle Book, Aladdin, and The Lion King&quot; with &quot;updated visuals and controls&quot; and will be coming to unspecified &quot;modern consoles&quot; and PC.

Described as a &quot;fan-favourite that&#x27;s sure to have you screaming like a Viking yeeted by Goliath&quot;, Disney was keen to stress that we &quot;have to wait to climb back into the world of Gargoyles Remastered&quot;, so we probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it any time soon (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Ubisoft is now inviting players to sign up and try the &quot;early version&quot; beta test of Rainbow Six Mobile.

Whilst keen to stress that the mobile devices in &quot;this test do not represent the final list of devices for launch&quot; and that &quot;content and quality of the game are still a work-in-progress&quot;, the developer/publisher says a closed beta will go live tomorrow, 12th September, in select countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Singapore, and India.

Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t look like any Europeans or players with Apple devices can get involved just yet.

Subtitled The Last Chapter – because, of course, it&#x27;s the last chapter – Valhalla&#x27;s final expansion is expected to launch &quot;in a few months time&quot; and sees Eivor &quot;say goodbye&quot; to their people and set forth for &quot;distant shores and new adventures&quot;. 

The free quest arc will &quot;nicely tie up some of the storylines established throughout the game&quot; and see Eivor reunite with some key characters... &quot;including some influential historical ones&quot;, according to Ubisoft.

                              <span>Gamescom might&#x27;ve been subdued in terms of announcements - at least compared to previous years - but it&#x27;s been quietly brilliant for unearthing interesting games. You might&#x27;ve seen our takes on the more big-and-obvious fare, from demos of Creative Assembly&#x27;s new thing Hyenas and Glen Schofield&#x27;s Dead Space-alike The Callisto Protocol, to a nice chat with Sonic boss Takashi Iizuka and hands on with Sonic Frontiers, a bit of time with Obsidian&#x27;s darkly brilliant Pentiment, and a look at Warhammer 40K: Darktide&#x27;s meaty gunplay. 


But! There are more games than just these big, obvious ones coming soon, and they very much deserve your attention, so here&#x27;s a rundown of all the other clever, inventive, or just generally interesting curios that impressed us from the show.

                              <span>The EA published The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth has received its first gameplay trailer, showing off the turn-based, mobile game in action.
First announced back in May, Heroes of Middle-earth was revealed as a character-collecting RPG, but no gameplay was shown at the time, just a single piece of concept art. Now, as revealed at GameSpot Swipe, the game has finally been shown in action, with the game&#x27;s art director Chris Salazar going into some detail.
Interestingly there is a new ring that&#x27;s been added to the universe, which according to Salazar, &quot;grants the player the ability to bring the best characters that best suite that battle that&#x27;s going to happen in that location, and somewhat push the bounds of what is the narrative canon.&quot; Salazar also explained that the new ring will make a lot more sense once you dive into the game.

                              <span>The latest patch for MultiVersus is here, bringing along a reworked hitbox and hurtbox, swapping out Velma calling a police car for the Mystery Machine, and adds in Gizmo.
Multiverse patch 1.02 is here, and has some pretty big changes for the game, the biggest being the hitbox/ hurtbox overhaul. Before the update, character&#x27;s hurtboxes were just a single, bean-like shape, more of a one-size-fits-all kind of situation. Now though, hurtboxes wrap around each character individually, which should make the action a bit tighter. 
The latest update also brings in a brand-new character, Gizmo, the kind-hearted Mogwai from the best Christmas movie around, Gremlins. Gizmo is a support character that can help teammates absorb incoming damage. His classic pink car can be used as a projectile to shoot enemies from afar, and can use an umbrella to either float to safety or ram into his opponents.

                              <span>What is presumably the next hero that was set to be announced for Overwatch 2 has been leaked via an unfinished animated short.
Obviously, if you don&#x27;t want to know anything about this unconfirmed hero before they&#x27;re officially revealed, stop reading here, but if you&#x27;re not fussed, be our guest!
So far, Overwatch 2 has two new characters confirmed to be coming to the game, who was also accidentally revealed through a leak, and Junker Queen, who managed to avoid the leak treatment. Unfortunately for Kiriko, the name of the the newest spirit-fox-themed hero, her reveal comes through another leak, this time of an animated short, though it&#x27;s not quite finished.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley just launched, but the promise of new content is already on the horizon with the announcement of a Toy Story realm.
It&#x27;s D23 at the moment, the Disney event that announces a big range of upcoming films, TV shows, merch, and games owned by the media conglomerate. Considering Disney Dreamlight Valley literally only launched this week it&#x27;s a bit of a surprise that new content has already been announced, but either way, there&#x27;s a Toy Story realm coming to the game this autumn. 
A trailer was released showing off the realm in action, which unsurprisingly is set in a kids room, though doesn&#x27;t appear to be Andy&#x27;s room specifically, with your player character shrunk down to get a toy&#x27;s perspective. The trailer revealed a couple of new outfits that your character will be able to wear, one an obviously Woody-themed cowperson outfit, the other themed Buzz that sort of looks like something you&#x27;d wear in your downtime at Space Command.

                              <span>Tekken is a massively popular series: the latest game in the series bypassing 9 million sales in its lifetime is proof enough of that. But as popular as the series is today, there’s something about the early games in the fighting game franchise – Tekken 2 and Tekken 3, specifically – that left their mark in the cultural consciousness in an altogether different way.

For lots of people, their first exposure to Bandai Namco’s 3D fighter was in Tekken 2 – but thanks to Demo One discs and the proliferation of Platinum games on the original PlayStation, I’d wager more people eventually got their hands on (and spent more time with) Tekken 3. And rightly so; it was argueably better than Tekken 2 in every way – and there’s something about the style, the music, the story, and the whole aesthetic that just belongs so wholly in the 90s. It’s become more than a game; it’s become a vessel for nostalgia. 
It’s fitting, then, that Netflix’s latest video game adaptation revolves mostly around Tekken 3. Tekken: Bloodline’s story takes us back to just before the third King of Iron Fist Tournament; we see a young Jin Kazama being taught by his mother, Jun, to channel his rage and power – and only use his martial arts prowess for good. Tragedy befalls the family, and Jin is instructed to seek out his paternal grandfather: Heihachi Mishima. One of the richest, and most evil, men in Japan.

Hogfather is the 20th Discworld novel and not a very good place to
start.  I recommend at least reading Soul
Music first for a proper introduction to Susan, and you may want to
start with Mort.



When we last saw Susan, she was a student at the Quirm College for Young
Ladies.  Now she&#x27;s a governess for two adorable youngsters, a job that
includes telling them stories and dealing quite capably with monsters in

                              <span>Working a bit more slowly - coming to the end of the process. I&#x27;ve been wrestling with a couple of annoying old laptops and creating mayhem. The others are almost through the process - it&#x27;s been a very long day, almost 12 hours now.
As ever, it&#x27;s good to be with people who appreciate this work - I&#x27;m also being menaced by a dog that wants fuss all the time. It certainly makes a difference to have fast connectivity and even faster remarks backwards and forwards.</span>

                              <span>Sony have been regularly releasing games on PC for a while now, with an often quick turnaround between &#x27;announcement&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27;s out now&#x27;. The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn&#x27;t arrived.

It seems like that will change soon. A recent, hastily-removed update to the collection&#x27;s Epic Games Store page declared that it would release on October 19th.

These are where you&#x27;ll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it&#x27;s still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it&#x27;s not. &quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; say Valve.

Among them was a first look at The Division: Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off from the Clancyverse shooter, which was described as an &quot;action survival shooter.&quot; You can watch it below.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

                              <span>A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin&#x27;s Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

This cooler normally costs £109, but today you can pick it up for £82 after a 25% discount.

                              <span>Summer is ebbing away, and I hate how it goes. I already miss long evenings, with sunset now before 8pm but sunrise still pointlessly at like 6:30? No thanks. I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on.

                              <span>&quot;History can help us better understand the world we live in,&quot; said Ubisoft during its Ubisoft Forward presentation, where we learned an awful lot about the future of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise. &quot;So many elements from the past resonate with our present.&quot; It&#x27;s a pretty big nod to the current state of world affairs, and the developer notes that it doesn&#x27;t want to stop making games about the past to help us better understand our future.
To that end, the publisher shared more details on its mysterious Infinty project. Back in Summer 2021, Ubisoft officially confirmed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity to be in development at its Montreal, and Quebec studios. Since we learned about the project, we&#x27;ve heard precious little about it – until today. 
During the showcase, staff from Ubisoft noted that Project Infinity “is not a game” per se; instead, it’s a single entry point for fans, that will act as something as a springboard into the future. It’s a hub, then, &quot;like a real-life animus&quot; per the developer – a place that unifies stories and experiences in one place. It sounds a little bit like a launcher to me, but we&#x27;ll see.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve probably played something by Clint Hocking: he&#x27;s a massive name in games, and has been attached to some of the largest games in Ubisoft&#x27;s history. The Canadian video game designer and director wrote Spliter Cell, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and Far Cry 2. He was also creative director on Watch Dogs Legion, and is co-creative director alongside Jonathan Dumont on the upcoming Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity..
He also coined the term &#x27;ludonarrative dissonance&#x27; back in 2007, too, so you&#x27;ve got him to thank for that one.
Why the history lesson? Well, at Ubisoft Forward, the French publisher noted that Hocking will be heading up a brand new game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe: Codename Hexe. The teaser basically makes it look like Assassin’s Creed: Blair Witch – there&#x27;s deep dark woods, a spooky wooden Assassin&#x27;s Creed symbol, and the promise of mystery.

                              <span>As well as announcing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, during tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, Ubisoft has also announced a brand-new game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe that will finally take us on a historic tour of Japan: Codename Red.
We&#x27;ve only got a very brief teaser for the game at the time of writing, and the title is still a while off yet (the next game in the series will be the aforementioned Mirage), but hey – at least we know it&#x27;s coming.
Ubisoft refers to this title as &quot;The future of our open world flagship RPG series&quot;, which seems to reference the fact that Mirage will be a more &#x27;classic&#x27; Assassin&#x27;s experience that leans on stealth and parkour more than it does damage numbers and massive worlds.

                              <span>It&#x27;s one of the year&#x27;s worst-kept gaming secrets, but at least now we know that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real. After leaks, a formal tease from Ubisoft, and a report that listed the game alongside a slew of other titles, Ubisoft has finally announced the next step in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed universe at Ubisoft Forward.
&quot;In Assassin’s Creed Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice,&quot; reads a blurb for the game. &quot;After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.&quot;
The new game will focus on one of the secondary characters we saw in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla – the Middle Eastern member of the order, Basim Ibn Ishaq. The game will take place some 20 years before the events of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and offer a more classic Assassin’s Creed experience. Ergo, it won&#x27;t be so similar to the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins, Odyssey, or Valhalla.

This is according to the Epic Games Store which listed the date on the game&#x27;s store page through the &quot;Pre-Purchase Bonus” section (thanks, Gematsu).
According to the page, which has since removed the information and now has it listed as &quot;coming soon,&quot; the pre-purchase bonus is a Fortnite glider resembling Sully’s seaplane. The glider is to be made available immediately upon pre-purchase, or you can wait until November 17 after it hits the Fortnite shop.

It all kicks off at 12pm PT, 3pm ET, 8pm UK, and you can watch it here with us. Alternatively, you can hit up YouTube, Twitch, or the official Ubisoft Forward website.
Ubisoft has promised to announce updates on upcoming games like Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Skull and Bones, as well as a special Assassin’s Creed showcase offering a peek at the future of the franchise. The firm may even discuss The Division Heartland, especially since information recently leaked due to the game&#x27;s store page being put live a bit too early.

                              <span>During the D23 Expo yesterday, Disney announced the upcoming platformer Disney Illusion Island, and it is a lovely-looking game that resembles a Mickey cartoon.
Starring Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Donald Duck, the foursome have arrived on the islands of Monoth on a quest to recover three mystical books. Doing so will save the world from disaster.
Developed by Disney and Dlala Studios, this 1-4 player cooperative adventure platformer allows you to choose your favorite character and unlock special abilities as you perform platforming feats, solve puzzles, and participate in boss battles.

Speaking this week in Paris, Assassin&#x27;s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté revealed a presentation slide for Invictus full of artwork showing past Assassin&#x27;s Creed protagonists, as well as enemies such as Odyssey&#x27;s minotaur. 


&quot;Codename Invictus is being designed to be a standalone game on the Infinity hub, alongside Codename Red and Codename Hexe,&quot; Coté announced.

                              <span>Ubisoft has laid down a roadmap for the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, featuring two major new games coming beyond 2023&#x27;s Baghdad-set Mirage.


Set in feudal Japan, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Project Red will arrive at some point after 2023. It&#x27;s described as an open-world RPG, a chance for fans to live out their powerful shinobi fantasy, and is in development by the talented Quebec-based team behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


Sometime after that, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Project Hexe will be next to launch. Details are extremely thin, but it looks to be a mysterious, witchcraft-inspired entry, and is being worked on by the Valhalla team at Ubisoft Montreal.

Infinity appears to be the brainchild of Coté, whose new role as head of Ubisoft&#x27;s biggest franchise sees him looking to revamp the series into a series of blockbuster single-player games, a standalone multiplayer portion and smaller free experiences for fans - all of which will be accessible from Infinity. 
The platform will also serve as the new, dedicated home to Assassin&#x27;s Creed&#x27;s modern day story, which will progress separately to upcoming games Codename Red, set in feudal Japan, and Codename Hexe, which looks to be set in 16th century Europe.

Jade will be set in ancient China, and let you parkour all over the country&#x27;s Great Wall as a player-created character. (So, no, you&#x27;re not playing as fan-favourite Shao Jun. But perhaps she&#x27;ll appear?)

                              <span>At a press event designed to set out the future of Ubisoft, its boss Yves Guillemot briefly touched upon its workplace crisis, which began in 2020. 


Numerous reports of sexual misconduct sparked a round of departures from the company, but Ubisoft has remained under pressure ever since - and even this week - from staff who feel the publisher has not done enough. 


On Thursday, in Paris, at a briefing attended by Eurogamer, Guillemot described the moment as a &quot;stumble&quot; which the company had since acknowledged and learned from.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward event has revealed a first glimpse at Mirage, next year&#x27;s new Assassin&#x27;s Creed adventure - although we&#x27;re still waiting for a look at gameplay, and there&#x27;s still no firmer release date than &quot;2023&quot;. 

Still, we now know much more about Mirage than we did through this year&#x27;s drip-feed of leaks from around the internet - and from Ubisoft itself. And this week, I sat down with several of the game&#x27;s Bordeaux-based development team for a deeper dive into what was shown publicly today. Read on for details of djinn, a popular rumour seemingly being denied, and more details on that Prince of Persia crossover.

Mirage is set in Baghdad and begins in the year 861, when the city enjoyed a golden age where it was a commercial and cultural crossroads. It was home to all manner of faces from all parts of the known world - a perfect cast for an Assassin&#x27;s Creed game - and also, of course, future Master Assassin himself, Basim Ibn Ishaq. When the game begins, we meet Basim several decades before his journey to England and arrival in the story of 2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. Here, on the streets of Baghdad, Basim begins as a petty thief, who catches the eye of the Hidden Ones.

                              <span>Join us tonight to watch Ubisoft Forward, a showcase of announcements from the publisher behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed, The Division, Just Dance and Mario + Rabbids. 


We&#x27;d expect to see all of those franchises represented this evening, when the livestream begins at 8pm UK time. There&#x27;s also a pre-show event for keen beans, beginning at 7.35pm UK time.


Ubisoft has promised this show will reveal the &quot;future&quot; of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, beginning with next year&#x27;s Baghdad-set stealth game Mirage. But we&#x27;re hoping and expecting much more as well - including a look, and hopefully some concrete details, on the company&#x27;s ambitious-sounding Infinity platform for the future of the franchise.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley has revealed an all-new Toy Story realm.

Showcased at the recent Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, the realm looks exactly as you just may expect, including a recreation of Andy&#x27;s bedroom where you&#x27;ll get to hang out with your favourite Toy Story characters.

Admittedly, we didn&#x27;t learn much else - the trailer doesn&#x27;t even last two minutes and the description simply says &quot;discover the brand-new Toy Story adventure coming this fall in Dreamlight Valley&quot; – but we did learned that you&#x27;ll be able to partner up with &quot;Woody and Buzz&quot; for a &quot;brand-new Toy Story adventure&quot; where you&#x27;ll also be able to bring your friends from other Disney valleys, too.

Valve says that should you &quot;encounter an issue&quot; with its new handheld system, you can send your Steam Deck for repair or replacement via one of its repair centres, where the team will &quot;diagnose the device, repair if needed, then ship the fixed unit back to you&quot;.

Whilst in-warranty repairs will be carried out free of charge, Valve does remind players that &quot;if your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty&quot;, although repair centres will repair accidental damage &quot;for a fee&quot;. Otherwise, Steam Deck owners are invited to &quot;fix things yourself&quot; with repair kits, replacement parts, and guides all available at iFixit.

Though the store page was almost instantly pulled down and amended, it wasn&#x27;t quick enough to fool the internet, which managed to catch a proposed release date of 19th October, 2022.

Looks like there&#x27;ll be a Fortnite-flavoured pre-order bonus, too; a &quot;snazzy new Fortnite glider in the shape of Sully&#x27;s seaplane&quot;.

2K confirmed the news earlier this week, saying it will be an &quot;authentic mobile experience for the NBA 2K basketball game&quot; that includes the &quot;all-new exclusive mode&quot;, The Greatest, which features 20 of the Greatest of All-Time NBA players from the current NBA season at launch, including cover athlete Devin Booker, and NBA legends like Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

                              <span>It feels real good to shoot stuff in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. This might not sound like the biggest deal - it&#x27;s always important for this type of horde-based, zombie-mowing game - but for Darktide good shooting is significant. Developer Fatshark, who previously made spiritual, franchise-adjacent predecessors Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, hadn&#x27;t used actual FPS mechanics before, with Vermintide almost entirely based on melee. And doing it right in Darktide, it turns out, has been a challenge.


&quot;It&#x27;s been tricky,&quot; says Mats Andersson, lead combat designer at Fatshark, who was speaking to us at Gamescom. He explains it&#x27;s something they had to build up to step-by-step, in part because of the game&#x27;s hybrid approach that mixes both melee and first-person shooting. &quot;We knew that we wanted to do a hybrid kind of thing,&quot; he said, &quot;as we wanted to keep the melee part, because we wanted to extend it, rather than have a completely separate game mode with ranged combat.&quot;


Originally Darktide had what Andersson called &quot;simple ADS,&quot; where holding aim will simply bring a ranged weapon up to the middle of the screen to give you that &quot;aim down sights&quot; perspective, like it would in most FPS games. But Andersson described the result, &quot;if you just have a static animation with some spread on it,&quot; as &quot;less than stellar.&quot; The big push, therefore, has been to &quot;up the quality of that, and doing some more finicky and sophisticated things with recoil and spread, the swaying animation blend sets, lining everything up so it&#x27;s so controlled that the gun lines up and shoots where it needs to shoot.&quot;

                              <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is getting a new Galactic Edition on 1st November that&#x27;ll include the base game and a total of 13 Character Packs.


To date, developer TT Games has graced The Skywalker Saga with seven DLC Character Packs - Solo, Rogue One, The Bad Batch, Trooper, The Mandalorian&#x27;s first and second seasons, plus a Classic Character Pack - pushing the game&#x27;s playable character roster well over the 400 mark.


Come the release of November&#x27;s Galactic Edition, however, that line-up will be expanded further with characters including Cassian Andor, Captain Rex, and Reva. These will arrive as part of six new Character Packs, named as The Clone Wars, The Book of Boba Fett, Rebels, Summer Vacation, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Andor.

                              <span>In June I caved and bought a Prusa
Mini
3D printer for home. I bought it just before an announced price hike. I went
for a Prusa because of their reputation for &quot;just working&quot;, and the Mini mostly
as its the cheapest, although, the print area (7&quot;³) is large enough for most of
the things I am likely to print.






To get started, at the same time I bought some Prusament recycled
PLA to print
with which, unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed with.
I was attracted to the idea of buying a recycled material and Prusa make a lot
about the quality of their filaments.
The description was pretty clear that the colour would be somewhat random and
vary throughout the spool, but I didn&#x27;t mind that, and I planned to use it for
mainly functional prints where the precise colour didn&#x27;t matter. The colour
examples from the product page were mostly off-white grey with some tint,
typically green. There are not a lot of reviews of the recycled PLA that
comment on the colour of their spools, but in a couple of youtube videos
(1,
2) the spools have looked a
grey-ish silver, sometimes with a greenish tint, pretty similar to the product
page.
The colour I got is quite unlike those: it&#x27;s a dull brown, with little flecks
of glitter, presumably originally from recycling something like Galaxy
Black.
That&#x27;s totally within &quot;spec&quot;, of course, but it&#x27;s a bit boring.


Brown recycled Prusament PLA on the right
In terms of quality, sadly I&#x27;ve ended up with had at least one tangle in the
spool wind so far. There&#x27;s at least two reviews on their own product page from
people who have had similar difficulties.</span>

First time together in Cambridge for a long time: several of the usual suspects - RattusRattus, Sledge, Isy and myself. Also in the room are Kartik and egw - I think this is their first time.
Chat is now physically in Sledge&#x27;s sitting room as well as on IRC. The first couple of images are trickling in and tests are starting for Bullseye.

This is going to be a very long day - we&#x27;ve got full tests for Bullseye (Debian 11) and Buster (Debian 10) so double duty. This should be the last release for Buster since this has now passed to LTS.</span>

The Qubes OS Summit is also very cool, great people and exciting developments!</span>

                              <span>A week ago I wrote about the rec-def Haskell library, which allows you to write more recursive definitions, such as in this small example:
let s1 &#x3D; rInsert 23 s2
    s2 &#x3D; rInsert 42 s1
in getR s1
This will not loop (as it would if you’d just used Data.Set), but rather correctly return the set S.fromList [23,42]. See the previous blog post for more examples and discussion of the user-facing side of this.
For quick reference, these are the types of the functions involved here:
rInsert :: a -&gt; R (Set a) -&gt; R (Set a)
getR :: R (Set a) -&gt; Set a

The type of s1 and s2 above is not Set Int, but rather R (Set Int), and in this post I’ll explain how R works internally.

Who make games like they&#x27;re films
Always should be something you really love
You couldn&#x27;t go anywhere in 1994 without Blur&#x27;s classic, Games and Films, wriggling through the airwaves and into your ears. No other song captured the mood of the era better. Video games were rising, but wanted to get the credibility of films, while films were looking at the growing success of games and wondering if they should be keeping an eye on them. Games with bits of movies in them were the result. A lot of them were naff, but we still enjoyed them.
The school playgrounds at the time became battlegrounds. The &quot;filmers&quot; of the time insisted that films are art and shouldn&#x27;t be disrespected by these new &quot;computer games,&quot; which to be fair was a common view of children up and down the country, likely the world, who had deep admiration for classic movies like Baby&#x27;s Day Out and Problem Child. A fringe group, though, calling themselves &quot;gamers,&quot; stood up for their exciting new hobby. Games didn&#x27;t have to be art. They could be anything they wanted to be.

                              <span>Evil West is a game you&#x27;re going to be hearing about a lot in the coming months, some might even say it could be your favourite action game of 2022. The Flying Wild Hog third-person shooter-meets-action-game dropped a lengthy new gameplay trailer.
This is the the second one of those we got to see this summer, and it looks even better. Though the focus remains squarely on the action, this new footage does offer a deeper dive into the narrative and a look at some of the characters.
Evil West takes place in an alternate history version of the Wild West. The trailer shows that the events of the game align with Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, which is a nice touch. We get to see the cowboy protagonist visit the HQ of the secret vampire-hunting corps he works for.

                              <span>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is no stranger to downloadable expansions, with the Trials of the King DLC launching back in July to a mixed audience. For a start, it was locked behind the hardest difficulty in the game, Bahamut.
That said, publisher Square Enix and developer Team Ninja have announced that an all-new DLC will be introduced to the game, named Wanderer of the Rift. The brand-new expansion will become available on PC via Epic, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5, on October 26, 2022.
Much like the expansion before it, this DLC will be available as a part of the Stranger of Paradise season pass. Provided you buy the season pass, which is currently £19.99 or $24.99, you’ll gain access to all three of the content packs for the game.

                              <span>Control of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex IPs has now officially transferred to Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics following their surprisingly cheap sale from Square Enix to Embracer Group. Alex and Jim wonder what this means for the future in the video below.
We know that a new Tomb Raider game is in active development. It’s being developed in Unreal Engine 5, and is set to “unify the timelines” of the classic games and the reboot trilogy. Quite how that will pan out is anyone’s guess: three games in, the reboot trilogy is still at a stage where Lara hasn’t *quite* become the Tomb Raider yet. Not quite risen. Not quite unveiled, still in shadow. See what they did there?
And so, though it introduced supernatural elements early on, the reboot has a lot of as-yet-unspun connective tissue to make up before any convincing bridge between Lara’s traumatic origins having to wade through the gritty realism of shooting Russian mercenaries and feeling quite bad about it, and her zenith (or nadir, depending on who you ask) as a wisecracking aristo thief who gleefully guns to death the last actual living T-Rex.

As was leaked, it&#x27;s about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

A new visual novel set in the neon universe called Tron: Identity was announced during this evening&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel games showcase, and it&#x27;s being developed by Bithell Games. There&#x27;s a very brief teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Foxhole hits 1.0 later this month after years in Steam Early Access, and the update will bring the most exciting possible addition to the massively multiplayer war game: trains. Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

                              <span>You start out aiming to restore a princess to a throne, which naturally tempted me on her every turn to lunge onto the nearest spear for a punchline, but I will forgive Tyrant&#x27;s Blessing for circumstances beyond its control.
Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

SadFutago’s The Nier: Automata Church mod is finally ready to download from NexusMods.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass. Spector’s comments were an attempt to put an end to speculation over what he described as “incomplete info” circulating online about Overwatch 2’s battle pass.

                              <span>Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed tactical RPG Midnight Suns will, following a number of earlier delays, finally launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - but the previously announced Xbox One, PS4, and Switch versions are still missing in action.


Announced last August, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns - which draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s - is superhero strategy game that follows a roster of familiar faces on an adventure blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.


Midnight Suns was originally due to launch in March this year but was delayed last November in order to add &quot;more story, cinematics and overall polish&quot;. Unfortunately, as its revised 7th October approached, publisher 2K and Firaxis made the decision to delay it once more to deliver the best possible experience for everyone.&quot;

                              <span>Little Nightmares - the original instalment in Tarsier Studio&#x27;s gleefully sinister horror platform series - is getting a mobile release, and will launch for iOS and Android sometime this &quot;winter&quot;.


The original Little Nightmares debuted for PC and consoles back in 2017, telling the deliciously unsettling tale of yellow-raincoated moppet Six, as she attempted to escape The Maw - a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.


The adventure was warmly received on release, with Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a &quot;masterpiece of meat and malice&quot; in his Recommended review.

                              <span>Former Call of Duty director and Treyarch co-head Jason Blundell has departed Deviation Games, the studio he co-founded with fellow Call of Duty alumni Dave Anthony - and which is currently working on its first, PlayStation-exclusive project.


Deviation Games&#x27; partnership with Sony was made public in June 2021, with the announcement only going as far as to say the 100-person studio was currently working on a &quot;brand-new original IP&quot;, said to have already been in development for a year at the time.


Blundell&#x27;s departure from Deviation - which comes even before the studio&#x27;s first title has been officially revealed - was announced in a statement shared on Twitter. It did not elaborate further on Blundell&#x27;s leaving, only saying,&quot; We appreciate the contributions Jason has made and we wish him the best in his future endeavours&quot;.

                              <span>There are lots of very good things about From Software&#x27;s majestic Elden Ring, but one of the very best good things - as is the case with much of the developer&#x27;s games - is its sublime soundtrack. And now publisher Bandai Namco has made the entire thing officially available to listen to across a wide range of music streaming services.


The newly released digital soundtrack runs a total of 34 tracks, variously composed by Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Tai Tomisawa - many of whom are long-time From Software collaborators, having worked on the likes of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Bloodborne.


Their cumulative expertise on Elden Ring, though, has created a belter of a soundtrack, and now users of Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, YouTube Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and Deezer can relive their adventures in the Lands Between through the power of sonic reminiscence.

As such, many dedicated fans have taken to Splatoon 2 to say their farewells to the beloved game, leaving Inkopolis Square awash with truly heartwarming messages.
Martin recently awarded Splatoon 3 a Recommended badge, remarking that while there are &quot;few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3&#x27;s multiplayer or campaign&quot; it is still the &quot;best Nintendo&#x27;s spectacular series has been to date&quot;.

Both songs have teaser videos featuring footage from the game.

You can also grab a free skin bundle for Realm Royale, but Hundred Days is certainly the bigger pull of the two.

Bertie and Donlan called Hundred Days charming and bright in their preview piece last year, and it&#x27;s a game I would personally recommend too.

The interviews were conducted by the ACSisterhood group, a movement that began in response to those misconduct and abuse allegations.

Sony previously shared a taster of the various offerings that will be available in its Norse epic, but Ragnarök&#x27;s lead UX designer Mila Pavlin has now highlighted even more of them, including things such as puzzle modifications and auto-sprinting down muddy roads.


Speaking to Game Informer, Pavlin said that the team focused on four main components when it came to accessibility: Vision, hearing, motor skills, and cognitive understanding.

Last week, Ninja tweeted &quot;I just need a break... I don&#x27;t know when I will be back, or where&quot;, removed his profile pictures across all platforms, and changed his display names to &quot;User Not Found&quot;.

&quot;Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass - we&#x27;ll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.&quot;

A report from XGP (via VGC), reveals that those who had pre-ordered the game have been receiving messages informing them that their orders have now been cancelled. 


The message goes on to state this is due to the fact that Stalker 2&#x27;s release date has been pushed back to an &quot;unconfirmed date in the future&quot;. Meanwhile, the pre-order option on the Xbox store appears to have been disabled.

You can find a code to claim on your ReedPop ID page, and if you&#x27;ve already bought a ticket and want to take advantage of the free early access upgrade get in touch and we&#x27;ll sort you with a refund for your original purchase. 


There&#x27;s some decent games to check out, though if I&#x27;m honest I&#x27;ll mostly be hanging around the Street Fighter 6 booths - plus some fun live shows, with Bertie putting on a pub quiz on the Friday and Saturday evenings while Ian and Zoe have just put their schedule together. I&#x27;ll even be there myself, so if you want to come and say hello I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find me at The Fox just over the road from the show itself on the Friday and Saturday.


It&#x27;d be lovely to see a few of you to thank you in person for supporting us, as it means a lot to us! It&#x27;s coming up to a year since we launched the supporter programme, which has seen the return of regular podcasts, the off-topic features and the weekly newsletter from myself.

                              <span>Take a break with a quick recap of the things you missed on Eurogamer this week, plus a little more discussion of them. It&#x27;s the Weekly podcast show.


Joining me today are returning-from-holiday editor-in-chief Martin Robinson, who tells us all about Splatoon 3, which he just reviewed. Why didn&#x27;t he give it an Essential like all the other Nintendo games he reviews, hmm? With the help of news reporter Victoria Kennedy, we put him on the spot.


Elsewhere, I talk about A Plague Tale: Requiem, which I played a healthy chunk of this week and have reservations about, though I&#x27;m still looking forward to it coming out next month. And we think about going back to Cyberpunk 2077 for new story expansion Phantom Liberty, which, if The Witcher 3 expansion Blood and Wine is anything to go by, ought to be good.

                              <span>Hello! Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we&#x27;ve found ourselves playing over the last few days. This time: morgues, graphic novels, and a bit of editing.
If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing, 
here&#x27;s our archive.
I had a proper creep-out playing The Mortuary Assistant the other day. All my hair stood on end and I was sweating and my heart was thudding. And it wasn&#x27;t the middle of the night or anything - it was late afternoon and RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race Down Under was blaring in the background - but it didn&#x27;t matter: I shuddered.

                              <span>In my twenties, a night out at the club was the highlight of my week, especially if there was a DJ playing whom I especially loved. I don’t mean one of those gargantuan Ministry of Sound superclubs where you needed a map to find the bathroom. I’m talking about a small, humble neighborhood club with appropriately watery drinks, cool dark alcoves, and a tiny dancefloor where you could work your way into a higher state of consciousness amid a throbbing constellation of moving bodies. I haven’t done that in decades, but tonight I’m bringing it all back for a night out in Off-Peak City – a surreal metropolis filled with anthropomorphic brownstones, hallucinogenic puddles, and some urgent business at the inimitable Club Low.

                              <span>Sure, EGX is mainly all about going hands-on with a whole host of new and unreleased video games, but did you know  you can also watch other people play video games, too?
And by &#x27;people&#x27; I obviously mean Zoe and I, aka the Eurogamer video team (but not Aoife as she&#x27;s on maternity leave). At select times during the four days of the expo, you&#x27;ll find us hanging out over on the EGX live stage where we&#x27;ve got seven (count &#x27;em, seven) catastrophically chaotic live shows planned for your in-person entertainment.
As you can see via the handy image above, among our offering is a return to the classic days of PUBG first thing on Thursday, and a special live episode of Happy Hour Tavern Time on the Friday, during which we&#x27;ll play Cult of the Lamb while answering questions from the audience (bring your best BMKs).

                              <span>Welcome to the August 2022 report from the Reproducible Builds project! In these reports we outline the most important things that we have been up to over the past month. As a quick recap, whilst anyone may inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users as pre-compiled binaries. The motivation behind the reproducible builds effort is to ensure no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

                              <span>Since I&#x27;m writing about my NAS, a month ago I happened to
notice an odd kernel message:
Aug 8 04:04] list_del corruption. prev-&gt;next should be ffff90c96e9c2090,
but was ffff90c94e9c2090

A kernel dev friend said &quot;I&#x27;m familiar with that code ... you should run memtest86&quot;.
This seemed like advice it would be foolish to ignore!
I installed the memtest86 package, which on Debian stable, is actually the
formerly open-source &quot;memtest86&quot; software, last updated in 2014, rather than
the currently open-source &quot;memtest86+&quot;. However the package (incorrectly, I
think) Recommends: memtest86+ so I ended up with both. The package scripts
integrate with GRUB, so both were added as boot options.
Neither however, would boot on my NAS, which is a UEFI system: after selection
from the GRUB prompt, I just had a blank screen. I focussed for a short while
on display issues: I wondered if trying to run a 4k monitor over HDMI was too
much to expect from a memory tester OS, but my mainboard has a VGA out as well.
It has some quirky behaviour for the VGA out: the firmware doesn&#x27;t use it at
all, so output only begins appearing after something boots (GRUB for example).
I fiddled about with the HDMI output, VGA output, and trying different RGB
cables, to no avail.
The issue was (likely) nothing to do with the video out, but rather that the
packaged versions of memtest/memtest86+ don&#x27;t work properly on UEFI
systems. What did work, was Passmark Software&#x27;s non-FOSS
memtest86. It drew on HDMI, albeit in a postage
stamp sized window. After some time (much less than I expected, some kind of
magic modern memory matrix stuff going on I think), I got a clean bill of
health:






It&#x27;s quite possible the FOSS versions of memtest (pcmemtest is another)
have better support for UEFI in more recent versions than I installed (I
just went with what&#x27;s in Debian stable), and if not, then this is a worthy
feature to work on.</span>

                              <span>I had this issue preventing me to start a call, which happened on two different browsers. It turned out that the pulseaudio service was hung, and no audio devices were available for the browser to use.
In that case it makes sense to check:
if pulseaudio is running
systemctl status --user pulseaudio

if pulseaudio is running, that you have a list from input (sources) and output (sinks) audio devices in the Gnome Desktop Settings. You can also check from the command line with
pactl list sources
pactl list sinks</span>

                              <span>Do you ever feel like you&#x27;re sitting down with a game like a worried parent, saying &quot;I just don&#x27;t know what to do with you?&quot; Because that&#x27;s how I feel about Phoenix Point after the last few months of playing it on and off. I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

                              <span>Monster-taming MMO Temtem just launched out of early access on PC earlier this week, but developers Crema have taken to Discord to defend the game’s paid battle pass. Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

In order to save the cosy town of Sainte-et-Claire, a charming mouse called Lila and a soft spirit called Lumion join forces to restore the town and its people. They&#x27;ll be teaming up on Steam later this month on September 26th. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

Beast Breaker wasn’t a game I was familiar with but its little mouse protagonist looks charming, as you can see in the trailer below.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

                              <span>Humble Bundle remains an excellent place to pick up video game collections at rock-bottom prices, and today&#x27;s 2K Megahits bundle is a doozy. It contains $660 worth of games from the publisher, including series like Borderlands, XCOM, Civilization and Bioshock, for $16 (or the equivalent in your local currency, this is a local sale). That&#x27;s a reasonable price for even one of these games, let alone the 18 games included in this bundle.

                              <span>Ahead of its official unveiling at tomorrow&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, new rumours have emerged surrounding Skydance Media and Amy Hennig&#x27;s upcoming Marvel title.


Announced last October, few official details have so-far been shared on the project beyond the fact it&#x27;ll be a &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.


However, Marvel rumour collator MCU Status is now reporting that Hennig&#x27;s game takes place during World War 2, and will see Captain America and Black Panther taking on the forces of Hydra. Eurogamer understands this to be correct.

To that end, Microsoft is this week launching what it calls a &quot;multi-month series of experiments to learn how to create a more personalised home screen experience and address some of the top trends and fan requests.&quot;

News of Gustavsson&#x27;s departure from Battlefield, DICE, and indeed EA as a whole, was announced by Battlefield general manager Byron Beede in a blog post detailing the future of the long-running first-person shooter series.


&quot;Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since the beginning and is affectionately known as Mr Battlefield, has decided he is ready for a new adventure,&quot; Beede wrote. &quot;Lars has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to Battlefield and is proud to have helped shape the franchise into what it is today. He is excited to pass the baton to the next generation of Battlefield creators at DICE, Ripple Effect, Industrial Toys, and Ridgeline Games.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly 10 years since my guest today started working at Eurogamer. And when they began, their mission was simple: make YouTube happen. We had barely an audience there at the time. Oh, we&#x27;d tried video - you might remember Johnny Minkley and Eurogamer TV - but we missed the YouTube wave. So along came Ian Higton, my guest today, to make it right.


He didn&#x27;t solve YouTube alone or overnight of course - to do that he would need a team and time. But it was his tireless work, largely alone for two years, that laid the foundation for what was to come. And his continued work has helped shape Eurogamer on YouTube into the channel it is today: a popular and welcoming place Ian is super proud of. Listen to him talk about it in the podcast - it&#x27;s lovely.


I didn&#x27;t realise how long he&#x27;d worked in TV beforehand, though. I knew Ian had worked for a shopping channel, which is brilliant, but I didn&#x27;t realise he was there for 10 years! He even rose quite high up. And he once dressed as Skeletor to covertly appear on camera for a Halloween special, and it was recorded so you can watch it too. That&#x27;s the cheeky Ian we know!

                              <span>The creator of adorable fox-themed action-adventure game Tunic says the offerings of Xbox Game Pass are the closest thing we have to the old school rental shops of days gone by.


Speaking to TrueTrophies (via TrueAchievements), Andrew Shouldice praised Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service, on which Tunic released, calling it an &quot;incredible deal&quot; for developers.


&quot;I think the thing that I liked most about it, that I didn&#x27;t think about at the time, is the experience of going to - in Canada - to rent a game,&quot; Shouldice elaborated.

                              <span>What&#x27;s the longest you&#x27;ve ever waited for a video game sequel? Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers was released all the way back in 1997 on the Sega Saturn, a first-person dungeon crawler JRPG made by developer Atlus. Four console generations later we finally have a sequel - Soul Hackers 2 - though it&#x27;s really a standalone game with mostly thematic connections to the original. 25 years is a long time in computer graphics, and Soul Hackers 2 has a wide variety of tech it could potentially use - but early footage didn&#x27;t exactly impress. There&#x27;s little here to suggest that the current wave of consoles are being taxed by this Persona-lite release - and the knock-on effect of that seems to be that the last-gen machines get some shocking ports, especially the vanilla Xbox One. 


Soul Hackers 2 borrows its gameplay elements from other recent Atlus titles, so at a basic level, it&#x27;s a turn-based RPG oriented around exploiting weaknesses, which is an enjoyable enough system but nothing out-of-the ordinary for RPG veterans. There are some twists, like an overkill-style mechanic that rewards strategic play, and plenty of customization. But this isn&#x27;t especially novel. Elsewhere, however, this game really shines. Soul Hackers 2 is a party-oriented title that weaves multiple characters through a winding, serialised story. Interpersonal conflicts and interactions take center stage here, and a social system gamifies out-of-combat interactions, giving simple conversations actual consequences. It&#x27;s more like a TV show than a movie, with a &#x27;villain of the week&#x27;-style narrative that features multiple short story arcs that build over time. 


This formula is fairly novel by industry standards but if you&#x27;ve played other recent Atlus RPGs - particularly Persona 5 or Tokyo Mirage Sessions - you&#x27;ll know what to expect. That fortunately extends to the rest of the package as well, with a keen sense of visual style. But you can&#x27;t make a video game out of artistic flourishes alone - so how does the 3D rendering hold up?

                              <span>Every time my daughter tells me about Minecraft&#x27;s 1.19 update, she describes it in completely different terms. Thrilled: &quot;One thing 1.19 introduced is these little animals, Allays, and if you give them an item they&#x27;ll go and find more of them!&quot; Frantic: &quot;There&#x27;s a new new boss called the Warden and it&#x27;s the very first blind Minecraft mob.  It can&#x27;t see you. It only does stuff by hearing so that&#x27;s why you always want to bring a sack of wool when you&#x27;re trying to find one.&quot; Strangely frank: &quot;I think a lot of people think Minecraft swamps are boring. 1.19 tries to change that.&quot;


My Minecraft expert is nine years old, and she&#x27;s an expert in Minecraft in the way that only a nine-year-old can be an expert in a game. Minecraft is a ready metaphor for everything in her life, but she&#x27;s also deeply engaged in the minutiae of it. She has no fear of its depths and complexities. I went through a period of thinking it was sort of sad that she didn&#x27;t draw in the evenings as much any more or play with her doll&#x27;s house, but now I realise: she still does this stuff. She just sometimes does it in Minecraft, and it&#x27;s all evolved and started to flow together: drawing, playing, landscape and imagination.


Let&#x27;s go back a bit. Like a lot of kids, ours has three or four games that come in and out of favour as the weeks pass. Minecraft, though, is the game that all the others orbit - it&#x27;s always in the number one spot. In many ways it&#x27;s the game she measures all other games by.

                              <span>Amazon was set to release a free-to-play MMO based on Tolkien&#x27;s Lord the Rings works sometime this year. However, in April 2021, the project was cancelled, with reports claiming a dispute with mega-games company Tencent was the catalyst for this decision.


Now, speaking to GameSpot, Amazon Games president Christoph Hartmann confirmed this was indeed the case.


&quot;We had a deal with a Hong Kong-based company, Leyou; I think it would have been great to work with them. But they later got sold to Tencent and it just got very complicated,&quot; Hartmann explained.

                              <span>I&#x27;d forgotten how stressful A Plague Tale can be. These kids really don&#x27;t get a break do they? It&#x27;s probably not right to even call them kids any more either - I&#x27;m not sure how old Amicia is now, in Requiem, the sequel, but she&#x27;s a young woman in attitude alone. She&#x27;s been through some stuff, they both have - Amicia and her younger brother Hugo - and they&#x27;ve been shaped by it. And whereas they largely ran from trouble in Innocence, and all of their abilities were based around escaping, more or less, now they&#x27;ve got some fight in them. They&#x27;re killers, and that changes things a bit, but I&#x27;ll come to that.
The stress: it&#x27;s a good and bad thing. Part of it is absolutely intended, I believe. Developer Asobo wants us to feel the relentlessness of the challenge Amicia and Hugo face in staying alive. They&#x27;re still mercilessly hunted by a shady organisation with a never ending supply of soldiers, and they&#x27;re still very much at danger from the plague ravaging the land: The Black Death and the hordes of rats that carry it.
Their existence is one escape from death after another. My goodness, by the end of the few chapters of Requiem I play, Amicia is a walking wreck, carrying a concussion that&#x27;s made her collapse more than once. But she slogs on because she has to - I really like Amicia (both the character and the way she&#x27;s acted and brought to life); I&#x27;m less keen on Hugo. The point is, they don&#x27;t get a moment to relax so nor should you. And that&#x27;s fine, but when the game is frustrating to play, problems arise.

                              <span>Just days after releasing an updated early access roadmap for Phasmophobia, developer Kinetic Games has announced the ghost hunting sim&#x27;s next big patch - known as the Apocalypse Update - will be arriving on 27th September.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Phasmophobia&#x27;s Apocalypse Update, starting with the arrival of the new Sunny Meadows Mental Institution map - an entirely reworked, more visually interesting, and, crucially, more compact version of the game&#x27;s previously released Asylum map.


A recent poll suggested smaller maps were high on the list of players&#x27; wants, and - intentionally or otherwise - the Apocalypse Update seems to be delivering on that front. Not only is a smaller Sunny Meadows variant known as &#x27;Restricted&#x27; included - offering &quot;5 small maps in 1&quot; - it also adds Camp Woodwind, a miniature variant of the Maple Lodge Campsite map.

This includes PlayStation 5 and Apple Arcade for the first time. On PS5, it will be &quot;tailored&quot; to the Dualsense controller, and after a year’s absence, the Touch series returns to Apple devices through the Apple Arcade platform.
“FM23 marks another significant step forward for the Football Manager series as we debut on two new platforms,&quot; said Miles Jacobson, Sports Interactive’s studio director. &quot;Fans have been calling for us to produce a PlayStation title for a number of years, so I’m excited for those players to now get the chance to experience the closest thing to being a real football manager.&quot;

                              <span>It’s been over 20 years since we first set off from The Shire with Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the Ring of Power, and despite a series of lacklustre Hobbit films doing their best to extinguish it, the passion still burns hot as the fires of Mount Doom for that quintessential trilogy of fantasy epics. In the times before and since those releases, with the exception of Tolkien’s other literary works, fans have relied heavily on video game interpretations to continue their direct relationship with the characters, settings, and stories of Middle-earth and the One Ring.
But, after a series of spin-offs and non-canon additions slowly boiling the purity of the IP down to directionless mediocrity, it’s critical that future iterations endeavour to recapture the familiarity and emotion that comes with being part of something that you believe in before it’s even begun. That’s right — I’m talking about movie tie-ins. Look, you might scoff, and I wouldn’t blame you for doing so considering tie-in history, but Electronic Arts mastered this in the early noughties with their direct film-to-game releases of The Two Towers and The Return of the King, and it’s about time that we reached for the same dizzying heights of success.

A lot of the complication revolves around licensing, and we don’t want to get too bogged down in that. But to summarise, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the rest of Tolkien’s works fall under an extremely complex network of rights that gives even Goldeneye a run for its money. But the fundamentals can be worked out when it comes to game development. The Tolkien Estate, at one time, held all the rights to all of Tolkien’s works. Over time, these rights have changed hands and have been split into different sections, ultimately resulting in Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit falling under one banner, whilst the rest of his works (such as The Silmarillion and The Unfinished Tales) fall under another.

                              <span>Sega may have long since left console manufacturing behind, but the Dreamcast remains one of the longest-lived games consoles going, with fans ever so occasionally putting out new Dreamcast releases. The system has a cult following - the Dreamcast never dies.


The latest new development in Dreamcast technology is now available to be backed on crowd-funding site Indiegogo - and it’s a curious upgrade to one of the system’s most unique features - its VMU memory cards.


For those of you who aren’t rapidly hurtling towards their forties or indeed already there, the VMU (Visual Memory Unit) was a fascinating take on the memory cards of the time, making them interactive and fun rather than simply a slab of plastic that held your save data. Original VMUs contained a little LCD screen that could display information from the game you’re currently playing - providing a very rudimentary two-screen experience years before the Nintendo DS would do the same with far more utility.

                              <span>The Wandering Village, a city-building sim where you manage a village perched on a giant beast&#x27;s back, will go into early access next week.
Developed by Sweden-based Stray Fawn Studio, the game takes place in a world where mysterious, toxic plants are spreading. You will need to lead a small group of survivors as they seek shelter on the back of a giant beast they call Onbu.
You will need to help the villagers build a functioning settlement and form a relationship with Onbu to survive the hostile world. As you expand the village over Onbu’s back, you will need to utilize the limited space as efficiently as possible.

                              <span>The next game in The Division series may have had its details released early, thanks to the Ubisoft store page for the game being set live prematurely. While the website has since been hastily taken down, a handful of eagle-eyed people on the internet managed to catch if before it vanished, and published the info online.
One such person, Unknown1Z1 on Twitter, recorded the page in full prior to its removal. In it, we can see several features we can expect to come to the game, as well as a basic description of what it’ll actually be.
The Division: Heartland will be a “free-to-play survival-action multiplayer shooter” according to the store listing. Set in middle America, the game will have a PvEvP mission type called Storm Operations, which has 45 players take part in a battle against “A group of dangerous rogue agents, an aggressive faction known as The Vultures, all while surviving a lethal virus”.

                              <span>In a photoshoot fit for Vogue, Hideo Kojima has shared some snaps to Twitter of him posing with some new Cryptobiosis plushies that’ll be available at Tokyo Game Show later this month.
Details have not yet been revealed regarding the price of the plushies, or whether they’ll be available online during and after Tokyo Game Show. What we do know, however, is that they’re quite charming, even if they are strange, small life forms used for replenishing blood.
Going off the photos that Kojima shared, it appears the plushies will be available in two sizes. One of them being small enough to prop up on a shelf or cuddle to sleep, while the other is large enough to make the perfect cushion, as Kojima exhibits. The plushies are also shown off beside a Danboard figurine for size reference!

                              <span>Despite Microsoft&#x27;s intent to continue making Call of Duty available on PlayStation platforms beyond the current deal with Activision, Sony says the offer is &quot;inadequate on many levels.&quot;
The offer was made privately between the two companies, but PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan made his feelings on the matter known after Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed it publically. This is the latest in a cascade of events following Microsoft&#x27;s decision to acquire Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, which is currently pending regulator approvals.
In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Ryan explained that Microsoft&#x27;s offer does not consider the impact on PlayStation players. Microsoft&#x27;s assurances, which Spencer made public in a comment to The Verge earlier this month, reference a written commitment in January that promised Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation &quot;for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract.&quot;

                              <span>I have just filed a complaint with the CRTC about my phone
provider&#x27;s outrageous fees. This is a copy of the complaint.


I am traveling to Europe, specifically to Ireland, for a 6 days for a
work meeting.
I thought I could use my phone there. So I looked at my phone provider&#x27;s
services in Europe, and found the &quot;Fido roaming&quot; services:
https://www.fido.ca/mobility/roaming
The fees, at the time of writing, at fifteen (15!) dollars PER DAY
to get access to my regular phone service (not unlimited!!).
If I do not use that &quot;roaming&quot; service, the fees are:
2$/min
0.75$/text
10$/20MB
That is absolutely outrageous. Any random phone plan in Europe will be
cheaper than this, by at least one order of magnitude. Just to take
any example:

This month I accepted 375 and rejected 25 packages. The overall number of packages that got accepted was 386.
I also had a closer look at the RM-bugs. All in all I addressed about 90 of them and either simply removed the package or added a moreinfo tag. In total I spent 13 hours for this task.
Anyway, if you want to have your RM-bug processed in a timely manner, please have a look at the removal page and check whether the created dak command is really what you wanted. It would also help if you check the reverse dependencies and write a comment whether they are important or can be ignored or also file a new bug for them. Each removal must have one bug!

                              <span>PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has spoken out against Microsoft&#x27;s offer to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Sony&#x27;s existing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard, calling the deal &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot; - despite Microsoft&#x27;s insistence it went &quot;well beyond typical gaming industry agreements&quot;.


It&#x27;s the latest shot fired in an increasingly public back and forth between the two companies as governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard grows, particularly in relation to its impact on other gaming platforms. The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, for instance, recently said the deal would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


It&#x27;s in this climate that Xbox boss Phil Spencer last week attempted to placate concerns it might be looking to make the hugely popular Call of Duty series - which the CMA called &quot;important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals&#x27; gaming platforms&quot; - an Xbox exclusive if the acquisition gained approval, insisting that it had &quot;provided a signed agreement to Sony [in January] to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably not much of a surprise given CD Projekt&#x27;s previous assertion that its currently in-development new Witcher game would mark the start of a &quot;new saga for the franchise&quot;, but the studio has now explicitly confirmed it&#x27;s already &quot;thinking about&quot; new instalments beyond that.


Asked to elaborate on the company&#x27;s use of the word &quot;saga&quot; during CD Projekt&#x27;s latest earnings call, president and joint CEO Adam Kiciński clarified that &quot;like the first saga was three games...we are in pre-production of the first game from the second Witcher saga.&quot; As such, the studio is  already &quot;thinking about more than one game&quot;.


Hardly a shocking revelation, admittedly, but additional clarity is always welcome.

                              <span>Whether a game console is a smash hit or an abject failure, I find myself drawn to all of them - and typically there&#x27;s at least one killer game you have to play. Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U arguably fits into the latter category, despite the fact that the system actually has a bunch of exceptional releases - and one of those titles is the original Splatoon, effectively Nintendo&#x27;s take on the third-person shooter genre with its own unique twist, the paint system. It&#x27;s a game that oozes style, kind of like Nintendo&#x27;s take on a classic Dreamcast game - and it&#x27;s brilliant. 


Like many Wii U titles, Splatoon hit Switch via a sequel: familiar in many ways, but fleshed out with a more comprehensive single-player offering and the excellent Octo expansion. Five years on, the third instalment is here - and there are plenty of changes and improvements to consider. I liked Splatoon 2, but this new release feels like a proper sequel, improving on the series&#x27; strengths and moving in new directions. The presentation instantly feels more elaborate, the single-player mode is vast and the visuals have improved. It feels like the game Nintendo has been working towards since the very beginning. 


That starts with your first contact with the game - a basic menu on the Wii U original with more polish on the sequel with a title sequence leading into the training sequence. Splatoon 3 makes far more of an impact, with a mysterious desert scene instantly setting the stage for what&#x27;s to come. The camera then cuts to your character with a more fully fleshed-out, animation rich character customisation sequence. It then seamlessly pans over to the starting point before kicking into the training mission.

                              <span>Developer Amplitude Studios has unveiled Together We Rule, the first major expansion for its historical 4X strategy game Humankind - one that&#x27;ll bring new diplomacy and espionage focused additions when it launches some time this autumn.


&quot;In Humankind,&quot; Amplitude explains in its announcement,&quot; we’ve always wanted there to be more ways to win than simple military domination. And while the game’s unified victory condition, Fame, was a first step towards that, we’re now ready to take things much further&quot;.


To that end, Together We Rule (which follows several smaller culture-focused DLC packs) will introduce new features - including the Congress of Humankind, Embassies, and Agents - that are intended to &quot;help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently&quot;.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 1 released last week for the PlayStation 5. 


Being a from-the-ground remake for the current generation of consoles - and given Naughty Dog&#x27;s reputation for attention to detail - everyone assumed that this release would be full of new improvements and fun inclusions along with the core gameplay.      


Now, these assumptions have been proven true, with The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s community sharing some of their recent discoveries online. Please note there will be spoilers for The Last of Us Part 1 in the article below.

On Twitter, Nintendo posted a video of the model, complete with some shiny visual effects, to show off the Scarlet and Violet inspired designs.

                              <span>When it comes to Nintendo&#x27;s most significant releases of the past 10 years, most would - quite rightly - point towards the towering achievement of The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild, though for me there&#x27;s a game that came out a few years before that&#x27;s every bit as important. The Wii U era was a commercial nadir for Nintendo, enlightened by the spark of something new; the lurid splash of colour that was Splatoon, a long-awaited all-new IP from the house that built Mario, and an impeccably enjoyable subversion of the modern-day shooter. For a company that can be too quick to fall back on the familiar, it offered the shock of the genuinely new. 
What&#x27;s more, Splatoon was a huge success and has since become nothing short of a phenomenon, with convenience stores in Tokyo stocked with o…</span>

                              <span>A new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet details more of what we can expect to find in its open world.


That includes three new Pokémon introduced here: the crab-like Klawf, plus the fire warrior Armarouge (Scarlet), and its ghostly counterpart Ceruledge (Violet) - could these be Bisharp regional evolutions?


Titled Seek Your Treasure, the trailer introduces the Treasure Hunt that forms a special independent study project depending on the version played. Check it out below.

Sharing the news on Twitter, Gunn revealed he made the pitch for a film focused on IO Interactive&#x27;s bald and ever adaptable assassin just &quot;weeks&quot; before he got the Guardians of the Galaxy gig.


&quot;The studio really wanted to hire me, but a producer on the project did not,&quot; he recalled.

Yesterday, CD Projekt Red confirmed the name of the forthcoming expansion due in 2023 and the return of Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand during its Edgerunners livestream.



However, a comment on a YouTube video teasing the expansion suggests it could be the only one.

                              <span>Corecell has hit back at publisher PQube, disputing its defence over withheld funds.


Last week, PQube was under fire once again from a developer (Corecell) releasing a damning statement against the publisher. It followed earlier accusations from Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions that left the team &quot;feeling manipulated and exploited&quot;.




With regards to its game AeternoBlade 2, Corecell claimed that PQube &quot;only paid a small part of the minimum guarantee of the signing milestone by the time we sent them the game and they never paid the remaining milestones&quot;, among other issues over publishing control.

                              <span>Gloomwood came alive for me when I got outside. This is immersive-sim-ish territory, everything tilted towards horror and stealth. Navigating the lovingly rendered PS1 era visuals, which do help a great deal to make ordinary objects singular and creepy, I awake at the bottom of a pit with nothing but a mysterious ally, taunting me through a nearby grate before offering me a magic ring. The ring allows me to tell when I&#x27;m hidden in shadow, and once it&#x27;s on my hand and the grate has been opened, I start to realise how useful it&#x27;s going to be.


My ally is nowhere to be seen. Instead I&#x27;m in small squirrely rooms, keeping out of the path of patrolling guards, lurking in the dark, moving from one safe spot to the next. I need to get out, which might mean finding the objects needed to call a kind of grain elevator, and may mean busting my swordstick out of a nearby lockup. Gloomwood&#x27;s linear but roomy: like I say, immersive-sim territory. I always know where I want to go, but my path there has a bit of leeway to it.


Combat I quickly discover, even with the swordstick, is a bad idea. Take guards on and they&#x27;ll slice your health away and slow you down. So much better to crouch, go slowly, considering the surfaces you&#x27;re moving across, using the leaning buttons to check around blind corners, using patience, sweet patience, to learn the patrol routes and then go for the one-hit backstab.

In anticipation of his arrival, the team has shared more about Gizmo&#x27;s moveset and confirmed that he will be a support character, much like the likes of Scooby-Doo&#x27;s Velma.


The small card shared on the MultiVersus Twitter feed states that Gizmo will have a move called &quot;Gizmo-A-Go-Go&quot;. This will see Gizmo attaching himself onto the back of his allies. He will also be able to &quot;sing and spawn musical note projectiles&quot; that will damage nearby enemies thanks to a move called Song of the Mogwai.

                              <span>Following on from the Cha-Cha bundle introduced at the end of last month, a new bundle for Call of Duty Vanguard and Warzone now brings even more from Netflix&#x27;s The Umbrella Academy to the fray.


This bundle, known as the Hazel Bundle, will allow players to &quot;suit up&quot; as Umbrella Acadamy&#x27;s other time travelling assassin Hazel (the clue was in the name there), thanks to the new legendary operative skin. It comes with the pink dog head and all, and is available now.


&quot;Everything happens like it&#x27;s supposed to... including your enemies getting eliminated,&quot; reads the teaser for this latest Call of Duty collaboration, which you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>A system update for the PlayStation 5 is now live, adding in a number of new features previously available in beta.



That includes gamelists, essentially folders, to make organising your game collection more manageable. Players can have up to 15 lists, with 100 games per list.


1440p HDMI video output is also available for those with compatible TVs or monitors.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t entirely convinced by MultiVersus when it leaked. We&#x27;ve seen countless platform fighters challenge Super Smash Bros across the decades, usually falling flat. Even Sony&#x27;s own attempt with PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale was middling, so I didn&#x27;t particularly rate a Warner Bros crossover&#x27;s chances. I&#x27;ll gladly admit those initial impressions were wrong. Even as a free-to-play game, that carries the usual monetisation pitfalls, MultiVersus sets itself apart where it matters. 

You can attribute some of that to the unusual MultiVersus character roster, which isn&#x27;t especially cohesive. Packing 18 fighters with more planned, they all fall under Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s licensing, but mixing Game of Thrones characters with Bugs Bunny just feels strange, no matter how you slice it. That said, I never questioned it once I started playing - everyone&#x27;s been well adapted. That&#x27;s helped by voice actors reprising their roles, with Kevin Conroy and Matthew Lillard returning for Batman and Shaggy respectively as major highlights. It&#x27;s a shame MultiVersus doesn&#x27;t give each franchise a specific arena to complement its cast, though you&#x27;ll spot familiar sights like the Bat Cave. 

It&#x27;s worth studying each character beforehand, since MultiVersus groups them between five classes. We&#x27;ve got the heavy-hitting bruisers, agile assassins, defensively-minded tank class, ranged mages, and support classes who&#x27;re better at buffs than damage. I appreciate this variety and the game prioritises 2v2 team fights as its main way to play, those support classes in particular helping MultiVersus to lean into this co-op emphasis well. (There&#x27;s also 1v1 fights and 4-player free for all&#x27;s but, annoyingly, no local co-op, which is a shame.)

                              <span>Stray Fawn&#x27;s The Wandering Village - a city building sim set on the back of a giant, roaming creature - will be launching into Steam early access next Wednesday, 14th September.


Announced last August, The Wandering Village tasks players with constructing a safe haven for a group of survivors in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world. Its city building aspects might be familiar, but those are combined with resource management, rogue-like elements, and survival, all connected to the ever-moving creature, known as Onbu, the survivors now call home.


&quot;Forging a relationship between the villagers and Onbu might be challenging at times, as their interests often don’t align,&quot; Stray Fawn explains. &quot;As a living creature, its unique body poses its own challenges for your village design. There&#x27;s every chance a spike may have grown where villagers intended to place their kitchen, while a failed harvest may cause desperation and tempt villagers to draw blood from the creature for food.&quot;

                              <span>PowerWash Simulator - developer FuturLab&#x27;s wildly compelling dirt-busting squirt &#x27;em up - is currently celebrating 3m million players having hoisted nozzles since the game&#x27;s launch on Xbox and PC back in May. And that milestone coincides with the opening of nominations for the next filth-encrusted edifice to be added to the game.


There&#x27;s not much more to say on the 3m players front, which Futurlab announced on Twitter earlier today, other than to say its success is thoroughly well-deserved. Eurgamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese - who wrote about the serene pleasures of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s sedate busywork in July - is far from the only member of the editorial team to have fallen in love with its daffy charms and compulsive rhythms.


And if, like me, you&#x27;ve reached the end of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s gloriously ludicrous campaign and urgently require more things to blast back into the realms of cleanliness, the good news is FuturLab is currently working on new additions - with the developer currently taking suggestions for what should come next.

                              <span>Tekken 8 was teased at EVO 2022 back at the start of August with a little cinematic that took viewers back to Kazuya’s ending cutscene from the original Tekken. You know the one, it was where we learned about his favourite hobby… throwing people he’s related to into an active volcano. This new teaser has made the series’ longterm fans excited to get ready for the next battle once again, and it’s also made me think about what I would like to see from the franchise as it moves forward onto the current generation of consoles.

Before we go ahead, I should preface the rest of this article by letting you know that I am a Tekken fan, and I’ve been playing the series since I first got my hands on Tekken 2 back on the original PlayStation. Everything I’m about to say comes from a place of love for the Tekken series, and well, a little bit of envy for what the bloodier competition has been delivering to its audience. I once got the wind knocked out of me by a partner because I was juggling her as Lei Wulong, and she didn’t find it very funny. I still play Tekken. I love Tekken as much as you do. I just think it needs to evolve in its presentation – and that the developers at Bandai Namco could learn a thing or two from NetherRealm. 
As a fighting game, Tekken 7 has by this point proven it has everything it needs to be one of the big multiplayer powerhouses. New mechanics like Rage Arts and screw hits are welcome additions to the fighter’s formula, and after several DLC releases the roster now has just about every Tekken character a dedicated player is likely to want to see, even including some weirdo guests. Fighting game fans know at this point that Tekken 7 is a solid, good time, and that’s why it’s the best selling entry in the series. But if Bandai Namco wants to sell even more copies next time – even quicker – then how does it recruit new competitors for us to fight online?

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok players will be able to visit the realm of Svartalfheim, and you get a look at the dwarven home in a short, new video.
In the Game Informer video, you can see Kratos and Atreus travling through Svartalfheim in a canoe, but according to GI, there may be other ways to travel through the realm.
The video not only shows off the large industrialized area but a bit of gameplay too. As you can see, Kratos can freeze geysers with his Leviathan Axe and smash hindrances like pots with his Chaos Blades. In the realm, the duo will come across mine pits, artificial water channels, and large cities that will no doubt harbor some &quot;complex&quot; environmental puzzles.

                              <span>It’s a massive day for Warframe fans out there, in fact, it’s kind of like Warframe Christmas right now. The Veilbreaker update is launching with new Kahl missions, Protea Deluxe has landed in-game, and perhaps most excitingly, Styanax is here.
 A free gift to players (for a limited time) to celebrate the 50th frame added to the sci-fi MMORPG, Styanax marks a major milestone in the ongoing journey Digital Extremes has ventured through over the last few years. Going from hail mary release of Warframe back in the day all the way to recent months as it expands its tendrils into a multi-game developer and publisher. 
To find out more about the design of this new frame, its conception, and how it reflects a newer and more contemporary Digital Extremes, I sat down with lead game designer Pablo Alonso, as well as newly-pink-shorted creative director Rebecca Ford (which apparently don’t even fit. Mrs Ford later informed me that a pair of sparkly pink boots will make an appearance on the next Dev Stream).

                              <span>Yesterday afternoon CDPR gave us all a huge update on the future of Cyberpunk 2077, which has gone from strength to strength since its troubled launch and has emerged as an essential next-gen experience.  Fans can look forward to a decent looking anime series that&#x27;s confirmed to be 100% canon with the games, continued updates that fix issues and add little bits of content here and there, and finally: a full-fat expansion which will add tonnes of new areas, characters, and story missions to the game. 
Sadly, however, for those still on PS4 and Xbox One, today&#x27;s 1.6 patch is the last update you will receive until you upgrade to next-gen or PC.
It was always a compromise on the old consoles, and CDPR look like they&#x27;re ready to let go of what is still an enormous share of the market, as pandemics, cost of living squeezes, and semiconductor shortages have made the Xbox Series and PS5 consoles a bit tricky to get a hold of.

It&#x27;s a more basic version of the current Series 2, comes in white, and features adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair trigger locks, and a wrap-around rubberized grip. It will run you $129.99.
However, you can change components on the controller by opting to purchase the Complete Component Pack that comes with interchangeable thumbsticks, paddle shapes, and D-pad. The pack includes a carrying case, charging dock, and USB-C cable. It will run you $59.99 and is compatible with all Series 2 models, not just Core.

                              <span>Finally, it has happened. CD Projekt RED has got out in front of the greatest problem with Cyberpunk 2077, and done the right thing. It’s years too late, of course – but the studio has finally done what it should’ve done before the game even released: it’s jettisoned the previous-generation versions.
Yesterday’s Night City Wire broadcast wasn’t exactly groundbreaking in its content, but it did contain exciting news for those who actually enjoyed the base Cyberpunk 2077. The live stream was mostly focused around promoting the imminent release of a Cyberpunk universe anime on Netflix – and in a cool twist, that animated show is entirely canon to the games, with designs and even some of the world layout ripped right from the digital version of Night City. 
Bookending a whole lot of anime talk was a little bit of video game stuff, however – confirmation of a new patch which includes some new content based around the anime, and the reveal of Phantom Liberty, the hotly anticipated expansion for the game. We got to learn a little about this expansion, including the fact that it’ll be a sort of spy-thriller that sees V working for the US government, and confirmation that Keanu Reeves has returned to the recording booth to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand for this new story.

In the games, you are enrolled in a school that hosts an independent study project called A Treasure Hunt. Three stories will be woven into your adventures while traversing the Paldea region.
One is called Victory Road, and it finds you going to Gyms in different locations to achieve Champion Rank. The second is Path of Legends. Here, Upperclassmen Arven will join you in search of rare ingredients called Herba Mystica. The third story is called Starfall Street and finds you challenging Team Star, a &quot;group of delinquents&quot; causing trouble for the school.

                              <span>Zombies have started taking over and causing havoc across Classic WoW, thanks to the legendary plague event added to the game early this morning. Across World of Warcraft, suspicious boxes can be found in hubs such as Booty Bay, which allows players to self-infect and go off and be mischievous.
To find out more about the Classic WoW zombie experience, I jumped in (before the massive queue times started) and met up with several players looking to make a mess in Classic WoW, through a truly limited, special event that may never return again.
My gateway to a zombie adventure was Millehouse, a level 48 Rogue in my guild who was going to great lengths to make the lives of horde players significantly spookier. They told me via in-game whispers: “I got to the crossroads and infected like 30 people. I don’t kill them, I just infect them so it can spread.”

                              <span>A couple of weeks ago, I described Splatoon 3 as a ‘difficult game to preview’, largely because of its iterative nature. It’s like reviewing a Call of Duty game, I suppose – bits and pieces change from one game to another, but the development machine for such an established franchise has gotten so sophisticated and so well-defined that any review inevitably isn’t going to be talking about big-ticket changes. It’s a little nip here, a little tuck there, and a modest extension to an under-developed feature. 

To put it another way, jumping from Splatoon 2 to this latest sequel is more like renovating a beloved old house rather than outright moving. That leads to a natural early conclusion of this review, and it’s a time-honored cliche: if you liked old Splatoon, you’ll love this! It’s like that, but better! Well, duh. Obviously. 
This also means that the sentiment expressed in the preview carries over here; it’s a difficult game to review. I could get into the minutiae of things like new weapons, new fashion looks, a barnstorming new mode in the form of the three-way turf war, or the improved Salmon Run mode, for instance. But then I’m waxing lyrical for thousands of words getting into tight specifics that, honestly, the hardcore probably already know, having voraciously consumed pre-release content, and the casual probably don’t particularly care to know.

                              <span>A new PlayStation 5 firmware update rolled out this morning to all owners. This is the official release of the latest major update, which entered beta late in July. All the features announced then have carried over, available to be experienced by everyone.
The chief new addition is support for 1440p resolution, which is very useful for players using their PS5 with a PC monitor, or any display that can only go up to 1440p. This resolution is a midway point between the ageing 1080p, and the demanding 4K. Previously, the PS5 was only able to detect either.
1440p support can be tested using a button in the settings menu, to make sure your display supports it. Unfortunately, and quite inexplicably, running the console in 1440p turns off VRR. PS5 currently only supports VRR for 1080p and 4K. VRR allows the screen to sync its refresh rate to the framerate of the game, eliminating screen tearing and making for an overall smoother experience, even when framerate is inconsistent.

                              <span>The latest from Subnautica developer, Unknown Worlds, is turn-based tabletop game Moonbreaker. Set in a sci-fi universe, players will be able to collect and digitally paint their own figurines before showing them off during play; something my inner painter is excited for!
While Moonbreaker is set to launch in Steam&#x27;s Early Access later this month on September 29, playtests are currently being arranged for those who want to try out the game even earlier.
Playtests will be via Steam, and the first ones will be happening on September 9 and 11 respectively. If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have time on those days, do not fret, as even more playtests will be happening on September 16 and 18, too.

                              <span>The veil around Steelrising has lifted, meaning early review impressions of the third-person action game, alongside all its shiny bits and blemishes, are out in the wild for the world to see. Comparisons to the rest of the genre, especially the From Software games that have set the bar, are impossible to avoid.
To go alongside our in-depth review of Steelrising, Connor and Jim have sat down to talk briefly about some of the games best and dodgiest parts. You can check out that video below, which you should absolutely do if you want a quick fix of informal discussion, or the occasional botched French word here and there.
Not to spoil it or anything, but Connor talks about the revolutionary France setting of the game, something they found particularly interesting throughout the process of their review. This pro comes with a chaser, the way your character’s background as a dancing, prancing automat is weaved into combat, represented as quite remarkable move sets. It’s pretty cool to look at at!

                              <span>It takes a lot of guts to throw SteelRising into the Souls-like ring. It’s a popular arena, ever-growing over the last few years as more and more people dive into a genre known for intense action, a healthy challenge, and gruesome, fantastical worlds. If a game can set itself apart, like The Surge 2 or the Nioh series, history has shown the move to be worthwhile. But for every success story there are twice as many bombs, who couldn’t stand up to obvious and unavoidable comparisons to some of the best games released over the past decade. SteelRising, in my mind after a full playthrough and some change, doesn’t quite make the mark. 

Let’s start with what you likely already know. SteelRising is a third-person action game, where you adventure across several levels taking on an environment packed full of difficult enemies before encountering a gigantic boss posing a significant challenge. You have rechargeable healing items that are restored at set resting points, as well as a variety of consumables that aide in combat. Killing enemies provides currency which can, in turn, be used to upgrade your character and weaponry. It’s a Souls-like. Chances are if you’re reading this review, you know exactly what foundation Steel Rising is built upon. 
For what it’s worth, this foundation is fairly solid! Your movement as a French murder doll in the midst of combat has you weaving in-between attacks and string together powerful combos with a mix of regular, heavy, and special attacks. Put on enough pressure and you can break an enemy&#x27;s posture, allowing you to land a single devastating attack. Backstabs aren’t here, but are instead replaced with a universal sneak attack you can land on any and all unaware automata. If you’re fiending for some of that Dark Souls-esque action, feats like these do indeed cause your brain to shoot off those sweet signals.

I&#x27;m wholly impartial, of course, but I am glad you haven&#x27;t forced me to come up with some contrived reason to jam a really big unreal place back into the running. We can continue. This week, it&#x27;s a question of jarring vs. juicy. What&#x27;s better: physics freakouts or beautiful food?

                              <span>The musical mastermind behind Rivals and Family is back with a new game. Riley &amp; Rochelle follows the two titular talented musicians, former lovers and eventual superstars, while you as the player are tasked with uncovering the secrets of their lives to find the reveal them. With Tim Sheinman joining forces with writer Natalia Yanchak, Riley &amp; Rochelle continues the playstyle of Sheinman&#x27;s previous interactive puzzle games, where you traverse through muscical memories both good and bad. Take a look at the new reveal trailer below.


This time you&#x27;re cast as someone making a movie about Riley and Rochelle. You must extract truths from diary entries, voicemails and other characters to correctly put together the timeline. Use your knowledge, deductive skills and appreciation for “naughty” 90s culture to succeed. Prepare to correctly answer different quizzes (the screenshots show an Audio Quiz and a Fan Fiction quiz) to test your Riley and Rochelle knowledge in the game. You&#x27;ll even have to research real-life events to get to the bottom of things.
As with Sheinman&#x27;s other games, though, music is the real star. A big part of the game is listening to audio recordings and songs sung by Rochelle and Riley, original tracks written for the game, to ascertain where, if, and how their relationship will end.

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>3rd person skater/shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Corecell came forward last week with the second accusation made by an indie team against PQube in less than a month, following A Space For The Unbound devs Mojiken Studio’s claims in late August. Both studios claim PQube withheld money from them.

Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

That user-space breakage is frowned upon and following that article the upstream DRM kernel maintainers outlined explicit requirements around firmware not breaking driver support. Intel engineers ended up submitting a quick fix for Linux 5.19 to still support the existing firmware while now a more adequate solution has been devised...</span>

                              <span>I have just deleted two forks I had of the GitLab project in my
gitlab.com account. I did this after receiving a warning that quotas
would now start to be enforced. It didn&#x27;t say that I was going over
quota, so I actually had to go look in the usage quotas page,
which stated I was using 5.6GB of storage.
I found that puzzling: maybe wallabako? I build images there in
CI... Or the ISOs in stressant?
Nope. The biggest disk users were... my forks of gitlab-ce and
gitlab-ee (now respectively called gitlab-foss and gitlab-ee,
but whatever). CE was taking up roughly 1GB and EE was taking up the
rest.
So I deleted both repos, which means that the next time I want to
contribute a fix to their documentation — which is as far as I managed
to contribute to GitLab — I will need to re-fork those humongous
repositories.
Maybe I&#x27;m reading this wrong. Maybe there&#x27;s a bug in the quotas
system. Or, if I&#x27;m reading this right, GitLab is actually
double-billing people: once for the source repository, and once for
the fork. Because surely repos are not duplicating all those blobs
on disk... right? RIGHT?
Either case, that&#x27;s rather a bad move on their part, I feel like. With
GitHub charging 4$/user/month, it feels like GitLab is going to
have to trouble to compete by charging 20$/user/month as a
challenger...
But maybe it&#x27;s just me: I&#x27;m not an economist, surely there&#x27;s some
brilliant plan here I&#x27;m missing...
In the meantime, free-ish alternatives include Quay.io (currently
free for public repos) and sr.ht (2$/mth, but at least not
open-core, unfortunately no plan for a container registry). And
of course, you can painfully self-host GitLab, sr.ht, gitea,
pagure, or whatever it is the current fancy gitweb.</span>

                              <span>During the first wave of RTX 3080 reviews, when we had no idea of the graphics card supply shortage to come, I remember being really impressed by the Asus Tuf Gaming model. It didn&#x27;t look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work. Now though, you can get the upgraded version of that high-performer at a more reasonable price: £650 for the Tuf Gaming OC V2, an overclocked model offering excellent performance for £400 below this model&#x27;s UK RRP.

America&#x27;s bad-ass actor dad played semi-imaginary rock anarchist (I know I&#x27;m being reductive, don&#x27;t leave comments) Johnny Silverhand in the main game, and he popped up to confirm he&#x27;s back for 2023&#x27;s expansion - which we now know is officially called Phantom Liberty.
There&#x27;s also the Edgerunner update dropping today, a tie-in for the Netflix anime Edgrunners (more info on that was also revealed tonight), and free-to-play mini game featuring Roach the horse, because we all like Roach the horse.

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th. See the great lumbering beast for yourself by watching the trailer below.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

                              <span>The latest playtest build of the next in EA’s Skate series appears to have leaked, continuing the pattern that seems to have been established for the game over the past few months. Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event. We list off our favourite panel moments, the best game demos we played, and our general opinion on how the overall convention went. Click play below to see one of our last videos from the event:

                              <span>Ahead of this weekend&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward digital showcase, a new report has claimed the event will offer a look at three previously unannounced Assassin&#x27;s Creed titles - one set in Japan, another in 16th century Europe, and a third in China.


Earlier this week, Ubisoft confirmed it would be &#x27;unveiling the future&#x27; of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise during this Saturday&#x27;s digital showcase, but stopped short of providing specifics. A look at the recently recently confirmed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage seemed a certainty, but a new report has suggested the publisher might in fact have a lot more its ready to share.


According to relentlessly leaky (and usually reliable) journalist Tom Henderson, writing for Try Hard Guides, Ubisoft Forward&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed portion will indeed begin with a &quot;deep dive&quot; into Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage.

                              <span>With God of War Ragnarök inching ever closer to its 9th November release on PlayStation, the pre-launch pre-amble keeps on coming, this time with a closer look at the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim in a new video.


Svartalfheim is, of course, one of the Nine Realms at the heart of God of War&#x27;s current Norse-themed saga, and one of three - alongside Vanaheim and Asgard - that were unreachable in the first game. Players will finally be able to complete the set in Ragnarök, though, as well as getting a chance to return to previously visited realms to explore new locations.


Svartalfheim, like other realms, can be accessed via the gateway located at the centre of the Lake of Nine (frozen over in Ragnarök thanks to the onset of Fimbulwinter) and - as detailed in a new GameInformer video - will present players with plenty of dwarven ingenuity to explore, including mine pits, artificial water channels, and sprawling cities.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol showed some gameplay to the public for the first time at Gamescom this year, with about three minutes of footage highlighting a bit of combat, a bit of stealth, and a slip-n-slide finish that ends with a bit of a crunch. Behind closed doors at the show, however, we saw a much longer version - albeit with the same stomach-churning finale - and had time to speak with the game&#x27;s director and studio head Glen Schofield.


Things begin with a jump - a scare as you open a door that then leads into a bit of one-on-one combat with one of The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s more standard enemies. The twist here is that enemies in The Callisto Protocol can mutate. After you engage them in combat some tentacles will start spurting out of their torso. Shooting or otherwise battering them in the tentacles will put them down faster, the mutation acting as a kind of weak spot, but miss your fairly short window and those enemies will evolve, gruesomely, into much more resilient, aggressive opposition. Dodging becomes important - there was a lot of ducking, diving, dipping and dodging in this demo - while you club away at them with a kind of riot baton in melee, although if more than one mutated enemy starts coming at you, you&#x27;ll struggle.


&quot;I think our combat is much more complex than we&#x27;ve made before,&quot; Schofield says, as opposed to how things were with the likes of Dead Space, this game&#x27;s spiritual predecessor and the series Schofield created. &quot;Especially with a sort of survival horror game - you&#x27;ve got a bunch of different weapons. I&#x27;ve always believed that survival horror doesn&#x27;t mean you would just have one bullet, right? Survival horror, I [think] means: I&#x27;ve got a clip, but I still can&#x27;t take them all out.&quot;

These images show a planned storyline similar to one seen in Angelina Jolie&#x27;s debut turn as Lara Croft, with Croft Manor being attacked by masked assailants.


Shared by artist Jake Lunt Davies, the images show Lara&#x27;s home on an atmospherically dark and stormy night. Meanwhile, in the grounds, several shady looking characters are depicted planning their infiltration of the manor.

                              <span>Mario Kart Tour has made Nintendo an estimated $293m globally to become the company&#x27;s second highest grossing mobile game.


That&#x27;s according to data from reliable app store analytics company Sensor Tower, from across both the App Store and Google Play store.


The estimates follow the recent news that Nintendo will remove gacha elements from Mario Kart Tour, which allow players to spend money on randomised rewards. This will be replaced by a rotating item shop.

But in one of the all time great Fahey pieces, he offered an even better description: &quot;I am a 6&#x27;6&quot; man with a vivid imagination and strange thought processes.&quot;


This is the Fahey that his readers truly knew - a gentle, sweet-natured giant with a brilliant mind and an eye for the angle that nobody else had thought of - a willingness to monitor a situation and just see where it went.


Fahey died last week at 49 after a long illness. He was a generous, ingenious, and kind writer whose posts always left you feeling happier - and more curious about things - than you had felt when you started reading them. He did indeed love snacks and toys and keyboards, of which he reviewed plenty. He loved video games, which he covered with perceptiveness, originality, and great care.

                              <span>Toby Fox has confirmed that the next chapter of RPG Deltarune won&#x27;t be out this year.


The creator shared the news on his Twitter account, saying: &quot;We won&#x27;t be able to put out any new chapters of Deltarune this year.&quot;


However, he does confirm that something is on the way to celebrate the anniversary of the second chapter and previous game Undertale next week.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima struggled to get live-action clips in Metal Gear Solid, not for technical reasons but because of a lack of contacts.


In a series of tweets on his Japanese account, he shared some background information on the game celebrating the 35th anniversary of the series (thanks SiliconEra).


Kojima wanted to push the realism of his fictional story using real war footage and, of course, the PlayStation console was able to play compressed film so this wasn&#x27;t a technical limitation.

                              <span>The Sims has been around for 22 years now, with even the fourth, and most recent, numbered entry being a venerable eight years old. My first time playing the original was a communal experience in the sixth form common room, crowded around a friend&#x27;s laptop. We created a replica of said common room, populated it with facsimiles of friends and mostly left them to their own devices. One of them forgot where the toilet was and peed himself, then cried about it.


The Sims 2? Not sure if I even played it. I was 21 when it was released in 2004 and, like much of my life back then, the memories are a bit fuzzy.
Number three meanwhile was inspirational. Not so much the game itself, although many would say it&#x27;s the high point of the series, but the writing about it. Robin Burkinshaw&#x27;s &quot;Alice and Kev&quot;, a blog chronicling the adventures of a homeless Sim and his daughter, really struck a chord and inspired me to try my hand at something similar. (It was rubbish.)

                              <span>Last week I watched Il Buco, or The Hole, the latest film from the Italian director Michelangelo Frammartino. It&#x27;s mesmerising. With very little in the way of dialogue, Frammartino tells the story of a 1960s spelunking expedition that explored one of the deepest cave systems in the world.


At first glance Il Buco seems filled with slightly trite opposites. The expedition comes from the urban north of Italy to the bucolic south, and one scene shows a cluster of kids gathered around a TV set that&#x27;s broadcasting a news piece about the tallest building in the country, which is being constructed while the spelunkers are heading off in the opposite direction.


But all of this is a distraction, I think. Or rather, it felt like Frammartino was throwing things in to the movie to allow you to ruminate and begin the process of looking for meanings. The bulk of the film is concerned with a more engaging case of opposites: an elderly shepherd spending his last days with his flock, while that hole slowly reveals its depths.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is getting in the spirit of Talk Like a Pirate Day with a week of celebrations that&#x27;ll include the swashbuckling multiplayer adventure&#x27;s latest XP-boosting community event.


The general festivities begin on Thursday, 15th September (running until Tuesday, 20th September),  bringing a free Arrrgh! emote for anyone that logs in during the event, plus special Merchant Alliance fireworks, and discounts in the premium Pirate Emporium store. Additionally, players will be able to pick up a second free emote - Ranting Rogue - from the Pirate Emporium.


The main event, though, is Season Seven&#x27;s Community Day, running for 24 hours from 10am UTC on Sunday, 17th September. A &quot;generous&quot; Renown XP boost will be applied to all in-game activities for the duration, helping players work through this season&#x27;s progression track more easily, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a set of additional player-driven boosts via Twitter.

                              <span>Our local Debian user group gathered on Sunday August 28th1 at the very
hackish Foulab for the August 2022 edition of our &quot;Debian &amp; Stuff&quot;
meetings.
As always, the event was a success and we had lots of fun. Nine people showed
up, including some new faces and people I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while:
On my side, although I was badly sleep-deprived 2, I still managed to be
somewhat productive!
One of the WiFi Access Points we use in our 4-apartment LAN had been
boot-looping for a few weeks, after a failed sysupgrade to the latest version
of OpenWRT. lavamind and I suspect the flash got corrupted in a way or another
during the upgrade process...
Lucky for us, this model has a serial port and runs U-Boot. After a
bit of tinkering, some electrical tape and two different serial
adapters3, we managed to identify the pin layout and got a shell on the
machine. The device has a reset button, but since the kernel panic was
happening too soon in the boot process, we weren&#x27;t able to get into OpenWRT&#x27;s
failsafe mode this way.

Once we had serial access, wiping the flash and re-installing OpenWRT fixed our
problem. A quick ansible-playbook run later, the device was back to being
usable and configured :)
I was too tired to keep track of what others did, but I took some nice pictures
of the pizza we got, and of this nice blow-up Tux wearing a Foulab t-shirt. Enjoy!


As always, thanks to the Debian project for granting us a budget to rent the
venue and to buy some food.
Please excuse the late blog post, it&#x27;s Harvest Season here and I&#x27;ve been
  quite busy. ↩
A bad case of wry neck kept me from sleeping properly for a while in
  August. ↩
As it turns out, serial connections work better when you use the
  right pins for TX and RX! ↩</span>

Before I start, the game I was talking about is called Cell To Singularity. Now I haven’t gone much in the game as I have shared but think that the Singularity it refers to is the Technological Singularity that people think will happen. Whether that will happen or not is open to debate to one and all. This is going to be a bit long one. 
Confession Time :- When I was sharing in the blog post, I had no clue that we actually had sessions on it in this year’s Debconf. I just saw the schedule yesterday and then came to know. Then I saw Guido’s two talks, one at Debconf as well as one as Froscon. In fact, saw the Froscon talk first, and then the one at Debconf. Both the talks are nearly the same except for a thing here or a thing there.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Borg backup for a couple of years and it has
seemingly worked very well for me. One difference I really appreciate from my
previous arrangement (rdiff-backup) is the freedom to move large
files or file hierarchies around (including between different filesystems)
without provoking large backup incrementals.
About a week ago I had my first real problem with Borg: backups started to
fail with the following complaints:

                              <span>Ubisoft will host its Ubisoft Forward showcase this weekend, and it seems the company plans to announce multiple Assassin&#x27;s Creed projects.
The company has already promised to discuss Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage during the showcase, and it&#x27;s possible it will touch upon Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity as well. Ubisoft promised previously that additional information regarding &quot;the future&quot; of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise would be shared during Ubisoft Forward, and rumor has it the company will announce three more projects for the series.
According to Tom Henderson, the Assassin&#x27;s Creed games we will hear about have settings in Japan, 16th-century Europe during the witch hunts, and China.

                              <span>As we keep waiting for The Elder Scrolls 6 and – way before that – Starfield, us veteran Elder Scrolls fans keep wondering about where Bethesda might take the long-awaited sixth mainline entry of their big fantasy series. 
Of course, we are almost sure at this point about where it’s literally going: either High Rock or Hammerfell, maybe even both. But what about everything else? More importantly, what about the unavoidable rework of its moment-to-moment gameplay and RPG systems? And beyond those elements, how big can it reasonably be?
As I discussed in my previous The Elder Scrolls 6 speculation piece, most folks are looking at Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls Online to fantasize about the next game. And that’s not a mistake, especially if we consider the ridiculous amount of Skyrim re-releases we’ve had in little more than a decade; that game is hugely important for Bethesda Game Studios. Even though Oblivion made the franchise mainstream thanks to its key role as one of Xbox 360’s early must-plays, Skyrim’s shadow is nearly impossible to escape and has shaped the entire open-world genre, RPG or not.

                              <span>CD Projekt RED has released a teaser trailer for the first expansion to Cyberpunk 2077.
Titled Phantom Liberty, it&#x27;s described as a spy-thriller expansion that will be set in an all-new district of Night City.
Not much is shown in the teaser trailer, but the country looks like it&#x27;s in trouble. As far as the storyline is concerned, well, the teaser doesn&#x27;t give us much in the way of that either.

This is according to Sensor Tower (thanks GI.biz), which reports the figure was generated within three years of launch.
It is a rather popular game, and during its first week of availability, Mario Kart Tour topped 20 million downloads across Android and iOS worldwide.

                              <span>Have you ever sat and listened to the bass riff in MGMT’s Electric Feel? I don’t think I ever realised, really, how integral to the song that little refrain is; the entire track is based around it! Ignore those hateful lyrics (hey, they’re a joke band, it’s fine), drink in those festival vibes, and let that bass sink into you… you feel it? Electric Feel is all about bass, I think. Why have I never learned to play that riff before? Well, I guess I’d never had someone show me how. 

Not until I was browsing the catalogues available at launch on Rocksmith+ and saw it there, nestled amongst things like Snarky Puppy’s excellent jam-rock meanderer, ‘Shofukan’, and The Eurhythmics’ seminal ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)’. I was alive in the 00s, I’ve definitely been in some shit Midlands club singing along to Electric Feel – why not plug in my bass, and give it a go.
Turns out, that riff is one of the most fun-to-play things I’ve committed to since picking up my bass guitar at the start of the year. I’ve only been playing the bass for nine months now, and whilst there are some transferable skills from my 17 years of guitar playing, there’s also a lot of new stuff to digest. Rocksmith+ not only gives me a fun new song to play – all mapped out, delicious, and easy-to-read with a genuinely intuitive UI – but it also identifies areas I might be struggling with and ushes me towards improving.

                              <span>There’s a new ad for God of War Ragnarok, featuring both Rick and Morty in a crossover I can safely say I wasn’t ready to see today. The game, launching on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on November 9 takes place in a mystical norse world filled with gods and monsters, one which the duo visited briefly all for the sake of a shiny new axe and a few gags.
The ad itself does, admittedly, have a few jokes that made me giggle. Rick drunkenly summarising the base plot of many AAA narrative action adventures like God of War as journeys to make choices and face the consequences, as well as opening a massive golden chest to find the leviathan axe and “other unannounced upgrades” was just meta enough to get me on board.
This isn’t the first crossover ad Rick and Morty have been a part of. Back in 2020, American fast food restaurant Wendy’s partnered with Rick and Morty to promote some of their breakfast menu, with humanoid breakfast baconator, honey chicken biscuits and an frosty-ccino rushing down and attacking the pair with pipes and bats. Fun stuff.

                              <span>Deltarune, the episodic pixel-art RPG from beloved creator Toby Fox, won’t have a new chapter release this year. This information comes straight from the creator himself, who posted an update on Twitter conveying the news to his 1.3 million followers.
While this is of course sad news for those eager to experience more Deltarune as soon as possible, there’s some chaser good news that you can swallow. With the one-year anniversary of Deltarune chapter 2 coming up soon, Toby Fox has teased something special next week.
As far as we know, development on Deltarune continues to go smoothly, with Toby Fox posting as much back in May and stating: “I&#x27;m getting more and more people to help recently, I have good feelings about it”, something that’s obviously great to see for fans of Fox’s continued output.

                              <span>Developer of Phasmophobia, Kinetic Games, is no stranger to updates and keeping players in the loop regarding them. The ghost-hunting game has been in Early Access for almost two years now, and it continues to get better each month as Kinetic liaises with its community.
That said, Kinetic has listened once more to the thoughts and feedback of players and will soon be introducing a Custom Difficulty update to Phasmophobia.
The previous roadmap shared for Phasmophobia didn&#x27;t go so swimmingly, but not so much so that players were in turmoil over it. Kinetic says in their latest development preview via Steam, &quot;Things didn&#x27;t exactly go to plan! Originally the VR overhaul was planned to release earlier than April, allowing us to get knee-deep into Custom Difficulty&#x27;s development. As it took longer, we pushed Custom back a couple of months and gave the community three smaller patches of content to fill the gap in content.&quot;

                              <span>It’s that time again - another video game world is under consideration by the design team at Lego, with a chance to become an official Lego product in stores the world over. This time, it’s a strong fit for brick-built worlds - with Terraria getting the Lego treatment.


The Terraria set comes through Lego Ideas, a project ran by the Lego Group that allows fans to submit set designs and ideas to the company. Any set that garners 10,000 supporters in the Lego Ideas community gets sent up to a board of Lego designers and employees, who then assess the set’s suitability for a final release. If they decide to pick it up, it’ll later appear as a real-life set, in real-life shops, no longer just a fan creation, but made official.


Making it to a final product from Lego Ideas is a particularly long shot, but the Terraria set has cleared the first major hurdle. In the realm of video games, both Lego Minecraft and Lego Sonic the Hedgehog began life as Lego Ideas submissions. In the case of Minecraft, a one-off Ideas set ultimately led to an entire series of Minecraft sets which are still going strong with new releases to this day.

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>The first gameplay footage of Katana Zero&#x27;s free DLC expansion has finally sliced its way onto the internet. Developer Askiisoft released a near-ten minute slice of the DLC&#x27;s first level over the weekend, showing off some of the ultraviolent delights we can expect to see when it eventually comes out. Have a watch of the level in full below (and apologies in advance to Jim, whose birthday wish of escaping any surprise intruders on his special day goes very much unheard).

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software&#x27;s upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won&#x27;t have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

                              <span>A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games&#x27; Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

Once again, it’s claimed that the game is being developed by Layers Of Fear studio Bloober Team.

                              <span>In an interview opportunity that Liam and I are still reeling from, we had the chance to chat to the cast of Team Fortress 2 about their experiences lending their voices to one of the most iconic FPSs of all time.
After watching yesterday&#x27;s TF2 panel, we were incredibly excited to put our own questions to the TF2 squad. Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes. Watch below for the entire interview.

                              <span>Kinetic Games has released an updated development roadmap for its deliciously spooky ghost hunting sim Phasmophobia, with the game&#x27;s custom difficulty feature now set to release this month with plenty more on the way.


As Kinetic explains in a new Steam post, the team has now revised its early access roadmap for 2022 and beyond to &quot;more accurately represents what we achieved this year, and what we plan to do moving forwards&quot; following a longer-than-expected development period for Phasmophobia&#x27;s VR rework, which eventually arrived in April.


Kinetic has released some smaller updates since then to keep players appropriately terrified but it&#x27;s all go in September with the advent of Phasmophobia&#x27;s Custom Difficulty update, which the developers says is &quot;a big one&quot;.

                              <span>The Torchlight series is returning - although this time as a free-to-play game for PC, iPhone and Android devices.


An early Steam version of the game is available to download now, as part of a closed beta test before a full launch next month, some time in October. (You can request access via its Steam page.)


There&#x27;s a whiff of Diablo Immortal to Torchlight Infinite, which has numerous ways to spend money within the game. Monetisation will include a season pass, monthly pass, auction house and premium currency bundles. Spending and progress will be reset at the end of the current beta, though the amount you spend will then be granted back when the game fully arrives.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s DF Direct is somewhat different than the usual show - a while back, Intel approached us, asking to be featured on a future episode to talk about its Arc graphics line. At the same time, Intel Fellow Tom Petersen, having seen our extensive image quality comparisons in our FSR 2.0 God of War video, was also keen to see the firm&#x27;s own XeSS machine learning-based upscaling technology put through its paces in a similarly rigorous fashion. That work is still ongoing and due later this week, but today I&#x27;m pleased to share the DF Direct Intel special, filmed in Berlin last week - not least because it sees Petersen addressing all of the concerns we&#x27;ve had about Arc over the last few months. 


I&#x27;d recommend watching the video through because we&#x27;ve got a lot of ground to cover, kicking…</span>

The console will release on 27th October and the included 60 titles from both the Mega Drive and Mega CD consoles have now been fully revealed, including two that were previously unreleased.

As reported last month, the console will have a tenth of the supply compared to the previous retro console in North America, so stocks are expected to be limited.

It seems that the Turtle brothers aren&#x27;t satisfied with their own success with Shredder&#x27;s Revenge have made their way into Spider-Man&#x27;s territory.

Created by SpaceDasher, the mod lets you choose between Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello or Michelangelo to swing around as. Or maybe that should be swim around as?

One such discussion taking place focuses on a potential new IP from Naughty Dog, that many believe will have a fantasy theme. This all started after several posters with fantasy-like elements were spotted adorning the game&#x27;s walls.


The posters in question, which can be seen below, show images of a Pegasus-like horse, a dragon, and a female warrior:

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings&#x27; primary antagonist Sauron has come to Elden Ring thanks to a new armour mod. 


The mod comes from MaxTheMiracle, and reskins the player with Sauron&#x27;s black armour and  humanoid figure seen in the likes of Peter Jackson&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings film adaptations (but without that imposing height).


This mod is still in its early days, but has been released to coincide with Amazon&#x27;s Rings of Power series. As such, the current weapon moveset used within this mod is borrowed from another mod, as work on it continues behind the scenes.

Speaking at PAX West last week, Booty discussed the increased prevalence of multiple developers working together on new games.


&quot;How we make games is evolving,&quot; said Booty. &quot;The idea of a single team under one roof really doesn&#x27;t happen that often anymore.&quot;

Crash&#x27;N&#x27;Dance is being developed by indie dev Fierce the Bandit, who posted a short video of their current progress.

The fan-made project is a rhythm game where players must hit button prompts in time to the music. Fake Crash will pop up on the screen sporadically in an attempt to distract you, but if you&#x27;re successful, Crash will perform his signature boogie and get a shiny crystal.

This update went live over the weekend, and also added an in-game account linking option.
However, despite being labelled as a &quot;quality of life&quot; update, this move by publisher 2K has left some fans unhappy, with several stating the game is now broken.

The store page also hosts various screenshots of the under-wraps shooter, and describes it as a &quot;free-to-play survival-action multiplayer shooter set in small-town Middle America&quot;.

                              <span>Ghostwire: Toyko is one of the exceedingly small number of video games that I&#x27;ve been bothered to grab all the trophies for. It wasn&#x27;t a fun Platinum either as, after about 10 hours in, the game gets rather repetitive and the trophy hunt becomes an absolute mind-numbing grind for collectibles. 
So why did I do I bother then? You might be thinking. Well, simply put, I absolutely loved the look and the feel of Tango Gameworks&#x27; version of Shibuya. The way the rain soaked streets reflect the neon signs is mesmerising to me. The gloriously detailed environments makes it feel like you really are in a real, living city in the moments after its inhabitants were spooky-raptured. It&#x27;s such a beautiful space to inhabit and as a bit of a Japanophile who recently spent his honeymoon wandering around parts of Shibuya that feature in the game, playing Ghostwire: Tokyo is also a great way to soak up the vibe of the city and indulge in some memories of my trip.
But now, thanks to an upcoming mod from master VR modder Luke Ross, I&#x27;m able to experience the world of Ghostwire: Tokyo like I was actually there and it&#x27;s by far my most preferred way to play the game. Want to see what all the fuss is about? You can watch me lose my mind over petting Shiba Inu&#x27;s in VR in this week&#x27;s VR Corner (below).

Retro Studios - the developer behind the Metroid Prime series - was long-rumoured to have worked on a canned Zelda game and in 2020 concept art of the project was discovered.



Now, YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming has uncovered more information about the project.

                              <span>The next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game, set in Baghdad, will feature crowds of people on its streets for the first time since the widely-panned Paris-set Unity.


That&#x27;s according to a fresh round of leaked information on the upcoming Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage from well-established Ubisoft leaker j0hnathan, who has now had his Twitter account suspended.


Among those details includes the fact that Baghdad will be divided into four separate zones, each with a boss to defeat, but also be surrounded by a desert area, oases and rivers.

                              <span>In anticipation of God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s release, a new promo starring Rick and Morty has been revealed.
American adult-oriented nighttime cable television channel Adult Swim shared the new ad on its Rick and Morty social feeds. The clip shows eccentric scientist Rick shaving his head and branding himself with Kratos&#x27; iconic red facial tattoo. He then proceeds to hand his grandson Morty a toy bow and arrow, before shoving him through a portal to the Nine Realms.
Here, Rick gets his hands on Kratos&#x27; Leviathan Axe and &quot;other unannounced upgrades&quot; as Morty tries to fend for himself (rather unsuccessfully) in the hostile world he suddenly finds himself in. It ends with Rick finding a boat, informing the overpowered Morty that he will have to row as Rick doesn&#x27;t want to get his new axe wet. You can watch it for yourself below.

Or maybe your playthrough was a comedy all along? There&#x27;s certainly a farcical element to all the constant dying.


The manga comes courtesy of Kadokawa - FromSoftware&#x27;s parent company and a huge publisher of manga.

                              <span>Jack Move. Jack Move. Here is a phrase that tickles somewhere, deep in the back of the brain, buried under boxes and old coats. Wasn&#x27;t someone...down for a Jack Move? I want to say William Gibson. One of the early ones - or maybe one of the present-day ones?


Googling will have to wait, because here is Jack Move, with a demo out on Steam now and a release planned for the 8th of September. Turns out we&#x27;re all down for a Jack Move.


And I reckon I was right about Gibson, because Jack Move is a cyberpunk JRPG, albeit one with modern sensibilities, which means the pixel-art is smooth and Treasure-textured and the action is implausibly brisk. Straight up: this is a lovely thing. Lovely from the way that you PATCH items rather than use them, to the way that you have stats for Sass and Guts and Grok.

                              <span>You aren&#x27;t alone in wanting a new Fable trailer, as Microsoft Studios head Matt Booty wants to show it off, but Playground Games is understandably not quite ready yet. 
The new Fable was revealed back in 2020, but as with many games these days, it was a cinematic trailer, so no gameplay to speak of. Who knows where it might be in development, but based on what Booty has said recently on a panel at PAX West, it still needs some more time in the metaphorical oven.
&quot;Part of my job is giving air cover to the team,&quot; Booty explained. &quot;They don&#x27;t want to show stuff early before it&#x27;s ready to go, but if there&#x27;s one game where that&#x27;s kind of flipped around, where every time I see something I say, &#x27;We should show this&#x27;, it&#x27;s Fable. Because there&#x27;s a lot of cool stuff.&quot;

                              <span>Rare’s legendary N64 first-person shooter, Goldeneye, marked its 25th anniversary last month. However, at the risk of raising blood pressure worldwide, I’ll dare to say that it’s not the jewel in the British developer’s FPS crown. That accolade goes to its spiritual successor: Perfect Dark.

With the announcement of a series reboot at The Game Awards in 2020, Microsoft’s newest studio, The Initiative, has been given the momentous task of bringing the franchise to modern audiences, with a little help from Tomb Raider industry veterans Crystal Dynamics. Ignoring for a moment that The Initiative sounds concernedly like one of the shady organisations that Joanna Dark would be taking down, the new triple-A studio has its work cut out in creating a debut title that manages to deliver the nostalgia that long-time series fans will want, as well as enough modernity to satisfy new players — something that Rare failed to do with Perfect Dark Zero back in 2005. If they want to be in with a shot of satisfying both audiences, they’ll need to learn from Rare’s mistakes.

Firstly, we need a cool-as-heck story. Very little has been shared about the reboot so far, but the cinematic trailer confirms the theme of ecological disaster. We see Earth from space, rife with storms, fires, and floods. We’re told of corporations offering “solutions”, but series fans will know that corporations have long played complex roles in Perfect Dark’s lore. We also know by the end of the trailer that dataDyne is still a featured antagonist, as the camera pans across dead soldiers to show Joanna standing atop a dataDyne super-structure, looking out over a storm ravaging the Great Pyramids. Setting itself deeply within the fictional side of sci-fi, Perfect Dark has always played with the idea of an alternative future.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 1 is out and firmly in the hands of players across the world. A great overhaul of an already brilliant game (as per our review), many are jumping in and scouring the world in Joel’s shoes once again. However, a secret recently found in this new version of the Naughty Dog 3rd person classic has some curious about the next big IP from the studio.
In the new game, players can track down and take a look at pin boards inside a pitch-black building. With the help of a flashlight, you can see several pieces of fantastical art featuring dragons, a variety of fantasy characters, and other mystical creatures and settings.
Now, there’s been no word on what the team at Naughty Dog are working on next, aside from the Last of Us multiplayer title they teased earlier this year. However, the studio has a history if littering their games with hints towards future titles. Uncharted 3 famously featured an easter egg pointing towards The Last of Us before its official reveal, so the likelihood that this is a similar situation isn’t nil.

                              <span>Even though split-screen co-op has been cancelled for Halo Infinite, players have worked out a way that lets them do it anyway.
Last week, 343 Industries provided a roadmap for Halo Infinite that promised players the Forge and Campaign co-op would be coming in November. Only downside is that split-screen co-op had been cancelled in the process, obviously leaving some players that were hoping to live out their youth once more disappointed. But it seems that some players have found a bit of a workaround thanks to a menu glitch.
As spotted by Eurogamer, French Halo community Halo Creation shared a video that shows a menu glitch that allows you to play the game in split-screen co-op. The Twitter account for the community has shared a helpful video of the glitch in action, which was discovered by Halo player Alexis B., and all the steps you need to follow.

                              <span>The game might not be out until the end of the week, but plenty of Splatoon 3 gameplay is already appearing online.
Street dates of games can often be broken by a day or so, whether it comes to a delivery service just getting a package somewhere early, or a store being a bit cheeky and letting a friend buy a copy a day early. Unfortunately for Nintendo, a tonne of gameplay has already leaked online just under a week before the game is out week, September 9.
As spotted by Kotaku, gameplay has been appearing all over the Splatoon subreddit, though the subreddit is removing any posts that shows anything that hasn&#x27;t been previously revealed in an official capacity, considering that it would technically be a spoiler. This is the subreddit&#x27;s general rule for spoilers anyway, so if you&#x27;re worried about visiting the subreddit post-release, there shouldn&#x27;t be any spoilers to be found.

                              <span>Some new details have emerged on Retro Studios&#x27; cancelled Zelda game that would have starred Sheik as the main character.
Retro Studios is best known for the Metroid Prime series these days, but did you know that at one point in time it was working on a Zelda game that would have put Sheik in the leading role? Did You Know Gaming knows, and it has recently put out a video spoke with one of the programmers that worked on the project.
Concept art for the game was released back in 2020, with the game supposedly intending to have more of a darker tone that would tell an origin story of the Master Sword, set in a timeline where Link fails to beat Ganon in Ocarina of Time. As a result of that artwork being released, programmer Paul Tozour was willing to talk about it, as well as an anonymous source, though it didn&#x27;t sound like a great game.

Supermassive Games first became renowned for Until Dawn, even winning a BAFTA award for the narrative-driven slasher game. Then came The Dark Pictures Anthology, a series of smaller, episodic narrative horror tales for players to embark on. 
Most recently, however, was The Quarry; another full-blown teen slasher in the form of a cinematic game, well worth the 4/5 we gave it in our review.

                              <span>The lead up to World of Warcraft’s Wrath of the Lich King Classic launch is well underway, with pre-patch servers up and running for close to a week now. This, in theory, lets players jump in and gear up a new character in preparation for our adventure to the frozen north, but humongous queue times across several servers have made this difficult for some players to get their adventure started in earnest.
This issue is affecting two types of servers present in Classic WoW. The first are the long-standing servers that have maintained a large population since Classic first launched back in 2019, like Grobbulus in the EU region. However, newly-created Fresh servers are also suffering. These new servers allow everyone to start playing totally empty-handed with others, without inflated economies or pre-existing fortunes muddying things.
Frustration and a healthy amount of joking around the topic can be found in heaps. Looking at the Classic WoW Reddit, numerous posts from players expressing their doomer outlook on the situation are present, listing out exorbitant queue times for their chosen servers, as well as some taking the plunge into less popular servers in order to kick their levelling journey into gear.

                              <span>Elden Ring is full of hidden areas, obscure bosses, and entire communities you may not get to see if you don&#x27;t venture too far off the beaten path. One of the more unique are the Ancestral Followers, who can be found deep underground in the Siofra River Bank.
The Followers worship the Ancestor Spirits, and can be seen gathering around its remains performing their rites. By following a simple mini-game, you can travel to the realm of the Ancestor Spirit and take it on in a boss fight.
All that is well and good, but the fight itself plays quite differently from all the other fights in Elden Ring. Most players who fought the Ancestor Spirit bosses in the game felt that they got a slightly different experience from the rest.

The images are reportedly shots - albeit very poor-quality ones - of an upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake from Bloober Team.
Now, we’re aware that Bloober Team are working with Konami given that the pair entered a partnership during summer last year. Just a month following that announcement, rumours began to emerge that Bloober Team was working on a new Silent Hill title.
Bloober’s CMO, Tomasz Galikowski, took part in an interview with IGN to clear the rumours up. Although, he ultimately left fans with more questions. The CMO told IGN that Bloober had applied for two projects with Konami, respectively codenamed Dum Spiro and Black.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the dawn of day three here at  PAX West, and what better way to wake us up than play the incredibly chaotic demo build of
 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang&#x27;s blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we&#x27;ve seen here at PAX so far.
If you&#x27;ve not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game&#x27;s trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game&#x27;s development.

It&#x27;s now the weekend so the show floor was significantly busier, but not enough to keep us from getting our mitts on some games. That&#x27;s right, we actually played some games today!
Have a click on the video below were we break down the day&#x27;s activities and also to see us get booted out from the show floor when it closed at 7. Here&#x27;s today&#x27;s daily round-up:

We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island&#x27;s world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game&#x27;s story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won&#x27;t wanna miss that.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz&#x27;s Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn&#x27;t anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game&#x27;s angry robot lads that roamed the city&#x27;s blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware&#x27;s horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

                              <span>Konami&#x27;s much-talked about &quot;unannounced game&quot; could be a new Suikoden title.

A renewed trademark for the game – filed back in July, but only recently spotted – has popped up in Mexico, leading some to speculate that if Konami&#x27;s upcoming TGS spot doesn&#x27;t involve Castlevania, Metal Geat Solid, or Silent Hill, then it just may be about a new installment of the classic RPG series.

The filing – spotted by posters on Reddit and shared at ResetEra – tells us that the filing was made at the end of July and… well, not much else, actually. But it&#x27;s certainly coincidental timing, isn&#x27;t it, particularly as the last main Suikoden title released way back in 2006.

                              <span>Earlier this week, 343 Industries confirmed that split-screen local co-op in Halo Infinite has been cancelled outright - so players are now doing it themselves. 

&quot;In order to improve and accelerate ongoing live service development - and to better address player feedback and quality of life updates - we have reallocated studio resources and are no longer working on local campaign split-screen co-op,&quot; 343 said at the time, dashing the hopes of players who&#x27;d been patiently waiting to couch co-op the campaign with pals.

Now, however, it seems that players have found a menu glitch that permits them to add up to three additional local co-op players to their system; all you need is an Xbox Series S or X and a pal online, and this helpful walkthrough.

                              <span>Fan-favourite League of Legends animated spin-off Arcane has won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.

The show beat The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, What If…?, and Bob&#x27;s Burgers to secure the award. It is the first streaming series to win in that category.

&quot;Honoured doesn’t even begin to describe how we feel about winning the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program,&quot; the show&#x27;s official Twitter account posted earlier today.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent the last week playing Saints Row on last-gen PS4 and Xbox One systems - and honestly? It&#x27;s really not that bad. The fundamental technological issues remain: the glaring shadow pop-in is back - and actually a bit worse here. The buggy NPC animations and physics return too. Of course, the 60fps target of the PS5 and Series X versions gives way to something worse - a sub-40fps frame-rate or even sub-30 in stress-test scenarios. Performance is still unlocked too, when a 30fps cap really would have made a positive difference, but I went into this one with low expectations, which the last-gen versions comfortably exceed. 


Similar to Xbox Series S, the wealth of performance mode variations seen in the Series X and PS5 releases are gone. There are no graphics toggles of any kind. On top of that, ray tracing features are absent, of course, but that&#x27;s fine. There seem to be fixed pixel counts on all systems with no obvious dynamic resolution scaling, but what is interesting is how the HUD overlay actually does seem to change res. It&#x27;s very, very odd. In-game DRS can&#x27;t be entirely ruled out, but the game looks consistent in terms of image quality, with only the flickering HUD giving any sense of a resolution change.


Looking at the qualities of the last-gen versions, you&#x27;d expect Xbox One X to deliver the best rendition of the game - but that&#x27;s only partly true here. At least in image quality, you&#x27;re getting a very decent turn-out here at a native 2560x1440, up from the less than stellar 1080p on PlayStation 4 Pro. The One X&#x27;s 1440p also trumps Series S&#x27;s full HD output - but quality settings are dialled back (particularly in terms of foliage density) and the unlocked performance level is actually worse than the PS4 Pro experience. With that being the case, there&#x27;s no real &#x27;winner&#x27; here in terms of the last-gen machines as while the One X looks significantly cleaner, frame-rates can hit a 24fps nadir - Pro is smoother overall, if far from the smooth and consistent in its delivery.

                              <span>The Mortuary Assistant is the latest video game to be getting the silver screen treatment. 

The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched at the beginning of August - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month. 

Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a &quot;companion piece&quot; to the game, and Kipp hopes to &quot;retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay&quot;.

                              <span>Another day, another alleged Silent Hill leak. This one purports to be of Bloober Team&#x27;s alleged Silent Hill 2 remake.  

They&#x27;re incredibly small and incredibly bad quality, which means they&#x27;re impossible to confirm either way with any credible veracity, but the poster shared the images with the legend: &quot;First leaked image of Silent Hill 2 Remake supposedly developed by Bloober Team&quot;.

As for what they show? We seem to be looking at a third-person POV with the camera behind the left shoulder rather than a fixed angle. The third is the most compelling - it appears to be a bubble head nurse and reminds me of Brookhaven Hospital, when the nurse jumps out from near the elevator - whereas the top is reminiscent of the leaked concept art images we saw a few months back.

While currently only available to pre-order in Japan – sorry; we&#x27;ll let you know if and when it becomes available in Europe and beyond – the collection is currently up for sale on Amazon.co.jp, with each book priced at ¥4400 - that&#x27;s approximately £27 or £55 for the pair.

According to Famitsu (thanks, PC Gamer), a collector&#x27;s edition which includes both books and a framed Godfrey print is also available for ¥17,600, which is £108. It all comes in a &quot;special three-sided box&quot;.

                              <span>If you have a spare cool mill laying around somewhere, and fancy upping your console collection, there&#x27;s an eBay listing you might want to check out.
With the world of video games offering a fair number of rare collectibles due to limited prints of cartridges, or certain consoles and peripherals not doing well enough to warrant much production of them, there&#x27;s a lot of collectors in turn who like to build personal libraries. And recently, an eBay listing (spotted by Consolevariations.com) shows a pretty impressive collection of roughly 2400 different consoles. And all the seller wants for it is €984,000, which is about a million US dollars, or £850,000.
The auction looks legitimately impressive. Images show a Japanese and (presumably) European version of the Pokemon themed N64, a deliciously burnt orange GameCube, a PSP Go, and so much more. Seriuosly, it is a ridiculuosly large collection that honestly could be worth the asking price. The user in question, kariaure, has even shared videos of their collection on their YouTube channel, with an extensive range of Sega consoles,  Game Boys, and more shown off.

                              <span>It looks like the next music act to possibly have a collaboration with Fortnite is none other than Lady Gaga.
According Fortnite Twitter account and leaker FNLeaksAndInfo, &quot;a new collaborative emote&quot; was added with a recent update called &quot;Jug Band,&quot; and when four players come together to perform it, a song plays that sounds very similar to Lady Gaga&#x27;s song Poker Face, as reported by GameSpot.
FNLeaksAndInfo then posted a follow-up tweet sharing the audio in question, and yeah, it sure does sound like Poker Face, although more of a southern American, country bumpkin take on the pop song rather than the original.

                              <span>Elden Ring has received an official manga adaptation, only it&#x27;s more of a comedy manga than you might expect.
If you didn&#x27;t know, Elden Ring is a very funny game. How could it not be, with the endless number of ridiculous ways you could die. But the tone of everything else is generally pretty serious. That&#x27;s what makes the announcement of an official comedy Elden Ring manga a little bit of a surprise, even if it is a welcome one.
The manga is being hosted on ComicWalker where you can already read the first two chapters for free, and has art from Nikiichi Tobita, with the story obviously adapted from Elden Ring itself. It starts much the same as the game&#x27;s opening slideshow does, with lovingly rendered drawings based on the original art. But from the first proper page, you&#x27;ll be met with a surprise: ass.

                              <span>According to Prey director Raphaël Colantonio, Arkane Studios was forced by Bethesda to use the name, even though him not wanting to.
If you haven&#x27;t heard of Prey, first released in 2017, that&#x27;s not particularly surprising, as it didn&#x27;t do very well (though it is one of Arkane&#x27;s best games). There was also a game released in 2006 also called Prey, made by Human Head Studios, which Bethesda owns the IP rights to. And so despite the more recent title having nothing to do with the original, it uses the name, and according to a recent interview with Prey 2017&#x27;s director, it wasn&#x27;t anyone at Arkane&#x27;s decision to use the name.
&quot;Calling Prey Prey, that was very very hurtful to me. I did not want to call this game Prey, and I had to say I wanted to anyway in front of journalists,&quot; Colantonio said on the AIAS Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook podcast (thanks, Kotaku). &quot;There is a bit of the artistic, the creative side that is insulted when you tell this artist: &#x27;You know your game? It&#x27;s going to be called Prey.&#x27; And you go like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think it should. I think it&#x27;s a mistake.&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>Diablo Immortal players are finding themselves with big in-game debts after purchasing orbs from third-party sites.
As spotted by PCGamesN, players are reporting that they are being left with massive in-game debts after purchasing Eternal Orbs, one of the primary currencies in Diablo Immortal, through third-party websites. These orbs are being supposedly revoked by Blizzard, likely due to the fact that orbs cost real-world money.
A number of different posts on Diablo Immortal&#x27;s subreddit are making the claim, saying that they own massive amounts of orbs in the game to make up for what they haven&#x27;t paid for in game. It can cost £0.89 for 60 orbs, going up to as much as £89.99 for 7200 orbs. Whereas one post notes that third-party sites are selling 7200 orbs for as little as roughly £8.69 ($10).

                              <span>According to a recent report, Microsoft plans to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;several more years&quot; past the marketing deal the latter currently has with Activision.
This comes from The Verge, which recently received a statement from head of Xbox Phil Spencer. &quot;In January, we provided a signed agreement to Sony to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract, an offer that goes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements,&quot; wrote Spencer in the statement.
It had already been noted that the next three Call of Duty games would launch on PlayStation, which obviously includes the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Presuming that Activision keeps up the yearly releases of the series, that means there will be Call of Duty games on PlayStation until at least 2024, and now, further beyond that.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company is suing multiple Chinese mobile game operators over a game that allegedly looks a bit too much like Pokémon, Pocket Monster Reissue.
As reported by South China Morning Post (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), The Pokémon Company is taking legal action against six Chinese companies over copyright infringement and unfair competition behaviour, due to some striking similarities between Pokémon and Pocket Monster Reissue, also known as Koudaiyaoguai Fuke.
Apparently the six companies in question have been running the game since 2015, based on a stock exchange filing from Jiangyin Zhongnan Heavy Industries Co, one of the defendants. In turn, The Pokémon Company has put in a request at the Shenzhen Intermediate People&#x27;s Court looking to have an order placed against the six companies to prevent them from working on Pocket Monster Reissue.

The breakout hit that mixed Halo and Portal will no longer have any feature updates, but while this marks the end of one game, it also marks the start of another. In a statement provided on Twitter, 1047 Games explained its decision to stop development on Splitgate, while also reassuring fans that its next game will also be a shooter with portals.
&quot;After careful consideration and much deliberation the 1047 Games team has determined that in order to build the game fans deserve - and to build it in a way that isn&#x27;t trying to retrofit and live operate an existing product - we are ending feature development of Splitgate,&quot; reads the announcement.

A tweet posted by the official Gearbox account links to a week-long auction which currently features 47 lots. At the time of writing, all have active bids on them, although it&#x27;s impossible how much for, as every one is a &quot;blind bid&quot;.

&quot;Gearbox fans may have noticed the loud shirts worn by our head honcho over the years,&quot; Gearbox tweeted. &quot;Now these shirts can be yours!

                              <span>Apex Legends has set another record, setting a new minimum daily peak count of 329,041 players on Steam last month.

As that only reflects the number of players on Steam and doesn&#x27;t account for the thousands of players hot-dropping on console, too, it&#x27;s a significant milestone for Respawn&#x27;s fan-favourite battle royale, and is further bolstered by the shooter&#x27;s recently revised concurrent player peak, which was also broken earlier this month.

As evidenced on SteamDB and spotted by PCGN, in July, the minimum daily peak was 311,275, but in August jumped to 329,041 players.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal players who purchased Eternal Orbs via third-party sellers with real money have had their purchases revoked, leaving them with in-game debts.

As one of the key currencies in the game, Eternal Orbs are crucial to progression, and are bought with real money. However, players who have forked out for Eternal Orbs via third-party sellers - no doubt in a bid to try and save a bit of money; in-game, they cost £0.89 GBP ($0.99 USD) for 60 all the way up to £89.99 GBP ($99.99 USD) for 7200 - have had their Orbs revoked.

While there&#x27;s little doubt that the Eternal Orbs were sold contrary to Blizzard&#x27;s ToS and most players likely knew that going in, it&#x27;s had a devastating impact on some players and led to significant deficits that will prevent them from fully participating in the game until the &quot;debt&quot; is cleared.

In a tweet posted earlier today, Schofield - whose team is currently working on the upcoming sci-fi horror, The Callisto Protocol - talked about working 12-15 hours a day, six-seven days a week, and working over lunch and dinner, justifying it by saying &quot;you do it because you love it&quot;.

&quot;I only talk about the game during an event,&quot; Schofield said in the since deleted tweet. &quot;We [are] working six-seven days a week, nobody&#x27;s forcing us.

                              <span>The Quarry developer Supermassive has confirmed it&#x27;s already commenced work on its next game and yes, it&#x27;s going to be the &quot;same sort of horror&quot; as its predecessors.

In an interview with our friends at VGC, studio director Will Byles said that while he wasn&#x27;t sure &quot;how far [the team] could stretch the teen horror thing out further&quot;, another horror is on the way in either 2025 or 2026, and it will be the equivalent size of The Quarry rather than follow the episodic format of its anthology series, Dark Pictures.

“We’ve started working on [the next game],” studio director Will Byles told VGC. &quot;I can’t really tell you very much at all about it, but we have started. Again, it’s the same sort of horror genre, we’re sticking to that. It’s equivalent in size to The Quarry… and that’s about as much as I can say without giving too much away.

                              <span>University sim Two Point Campus has clocked up one million players in just a fortnight. 

Publisher Sega said its &quot;bags of charm and tongue-in-cheek comedy&quot; means the hit management sim has &quot;surpassed the milestone even faster than its much-loved predecessor, Two Point Hospital&quot;.

&quot;Two Point Campus was such a thrill to create so we’re ecstatic to see so many people enjoying the game as much as they do!&quot; said studio director, Mark Webley. &quot;We had high hopes that we had created something that fans would love, but the response has exceeded all expectations! We’d like to send a massive thank you to all of the players out there who are showing support by building their wild and wonderful campuses – we can’t wait to see what more you’ll create.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Good writing&quot; is a phrase that gets used quite often, and it can mean a lot of different things. Is good writing a good story? An unguessable twist? Fancy prose or deliberate themes? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve used it at some point when what I meant to say is really: &quot;lots of long words I don&#x27;t completely understand.&quot; 


Still, Pentiment has good writing - wonderful writing, actually - and in this case I do know what it means. This game&#x27;s writing is witty, it has tempo and timing, it is genuinely, wickedly funny. It is also, above all, natural - something that so often seems impossible in games, things where you&#x27;re so often controlling a character impulsively, pulling their puppet strings on a whim. How do you write around that? Pentiment, Obsidian&#x27;s surprise new thing that I am judging from an admittedly quite brief hands-on at Gamescom, seems to manage it remarkably well.


Things begin in Pentiment with you choosing a background, in a fairly typical, tabletop RPG-inspired way but with a nicely in-theme twist, whereby you play as a semi-educated bloke with a choice of studies and interests. I chose to have studied Logic and dropped out halfway through Theology, with an interest in the Occult, a mediaeval gap year to Flanders and a bit of a taste for Hedonism (although I was tempted to be a Rapscallion who liked scampering about picking fights and generally being a peevish little imp, like a kind of Dark Age Bart Simpson. Hedonism ultimately just felt like it suited a dropout Theologian a little better.)

Morgues. All I have to do is write the word and it evokes a reaction. These places are steeped in our fundamental fears and preoccupations with death, and those fears and preoccupations are preyed upon by entertainment and amped up for horrors or police dramas. Chances are, you&#x27;ve never been in a morgue, but I bet you have an idea of what one looks like.
I&#x27;ve been thinking about morgues this week because I&#x27;ve been in a couple and they made a strong impression on me. They&#x27;re not real, they&#x27;re in games, and the games are very much based around them.

                              <span>In the run up to New Tales from the Borderlands&#x27; release on 21st October, developer Gearbox has shared 18 minutes of new gameplay footage, offering the best look yet at this long-awaited follow-up to Telltale Games&#x27; acclaimed original.


New Tales from the Borderlands follows the same choice-driven &quot;interactive fiction&quot; template as its predecessor - indeed, Gearbox has hired &quot;key alumni&quot; of the original Telltale Games narrative team for the project - but features three new protagonists in an all-new adventure. 


This time around, all eyes are on Fran Miscowicz - out for revenge after a Maliwan laser hits her frogurt shop - altruistic scientist Anuradha Dahr, and her ambitious &quot;streetwise&quot; brother Octavio Wallace-Dahr, who&#x27;s looking to make his own mark on the metropolis of Promethea.

                              <span>Haskell is a pure and lazy programming language, and the laziness allows us to write some algorithms very elegantly, by recursively referring to already calculated values. A typical example is the following definition of the Fibonacci numbers, as an infinite stream:
fibs &#x3D; 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

Elegant graph traversals
A maybe more practical example is the following calculation of the transitive closure of a graph:

import qualified Data.Set as S
import qualified Data.Map as M

type Graph &#x3D; M.Map Int (S.Set Int)
transitive1 :: Graph -&gt; Graph
transitive1 g &#x3D; sets
  where
    sets :: M.Map Int (S.Set Int)
    sets &#x3D; M.mapWithKey (\v vs -&gt; S.insert v (S.unions [ sets M.! v&#x27; | v&#x27; &lt;- S.toList vs ])) g

Now unless you have been living under a rock cave, I am sure you know who Mr. Tolkein is. Apparently, the gentleman passed away on 2nd September 1973 at the sprightly age of 80. And this gives fans like me to talk about fantasy, fantasy authors, and the love-hate relationship we have with them. For a matter of record, I am currently reading Babylon Steel by Gaie Sebold. Now while I won’t go into many details (I never like to, if I enjoy a book, I would want the book to be mysterious rather than give praise, simply so that the next person enjoys it as much as I did without having any expectations.) Now this book has plenty of sex so wouldn’t recommend it for teenagers but more perhaps to mature audiences, although for the life of me couldn’t find any rating on the book. I did…</span>

Even in new devices where no plug-in changes are required, new device entries are still needed in the quirks table and it makes it challenging when Linux distributions don&#x27;t quickly move to new FWUPD releases.

                              <span>A few weeks ago we posted about a stellar deal on Lenovo&#x27;s BoostStation, an external GPU enclosure that lets you turn almost any Thunderbolt 3 laptop into a gaming powerhouse with the simple addition of a graphics card. Rather than the £200 or £300 prices we normally see attached to these enclosures, this one was available at just £93. Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. 
This time though, you&#x27;ll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

                              <span>Seagate&#x27;s IronWolf and IronWolf Pro hard drives are amongst the best available, and now you can get an 8TB IronWolf model for £150 at Amazon, a historic low price. 
This is a huge amount of storage, ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video, and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison, the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669, making this more than four times cheaper.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a busy day at PAX West, but nothing has been as wild as the Gearbox Software panel. Randy Pitchford made a return to the Seattle stage to let us know what&#x27;s coming up for Gearbox, but not without some shenanigans first.
After a classic Randy magic trick, a proud display of lock-down Lego builds, and a chaotic bidding war where he auctioned off the literal shirt off his back (which an audience member bought for an eye-watering $1200) we finally got to see some fresh New Tales From The Borderlands gameplay and had a lovely chat with director of production, James Lopez. Watch the video below for the interview in its entirety - it&#x27;s a good&#x27;un!

                              <span>The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Batman, The Wolf Among Us, Minecraft, Borderlands, Guardians of the Galaxy… the reign of Telltale Games, at its peak, was truly something to behold. Between 2010 and 2016, the studio churned out a number of games that defined the conversation in gaming. You couldn’t open a gaming mag (or navigate the homepage of a gaming site) without something from Telltale making itself known. Its games were everywhere, all of the time. 


Until they weren’t. The studio hit critical mass, and the quality of its games suffered: from 2017 onwards, after a restructuring of the studio that affected the cadence of its releases, the studio fell from grace. In trying to recreate the magic of The Walking Dead, Telltale creatively suffocated its staff and homogenised its output. A series of gaffes soiled the company’s reputation. As quickly as the world fell in love with the studio, it forgot about it. The second season of the Wolf Among Us, as well as a planned Stranger Things game, were cancelled.
But that’s not to say there’s anything wrong with the formula: in fact, quite the opposite is true. During its height, people loved Telltale because it harkened back to an era of classic, narrative-focused adventure games. You don’t sell 28 million-plus episodes if there’s something fundamentally wrong with the way your games work, do you? To that end, you can see why Gearbox Software partnered with “key alumni” of the original Telltale Games narrative team revisit one of the most cult titles in the studio’s back catalogue: Tales From the Borderlands.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a three-day weekend in the US, which means those of you in the region will hopefully be enjoying the time off.
The Labor Day weekend is usually like any other long weekend in the US. Full of barbeques, relaxing, having a few drinks, and enjoying what&#x27;s left of the summer. As you see, this is the last summer holiday weekend for us, and it also signals the end of the swimming season at public pools. This is fine for some of us who have a phobia of community swimming pools (pools are NOT a unrinal people!)
For the rest of the folks not in the US, it&#x27;s probably just an ordinary weekend, but time off nonetheless, so why not enjoy it by playing some games? That&#x27;s what the folks at VG247 plan to do.

As if relationships in the game aren&#x27;t full of enough drama as it stands now, things could become worse - or better. It depends on how things play out.
In the pack, your relationships will matter more than ever as those closest to you come alive in &quot;the most intimate detail.&quot; This is thanks to over 100 new experiences included in the new event pack.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red will talk about all things Cyberpunk next week on September 6, and specifically about what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077.
The studio will also discuss its anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners which is scheduled to debut on Netflix September 13.
The show is a joint project between CD Projekt, Studio Trigger, and Netflix and is set in Cyberpunk 2077’s universe, but features a different story and takes place in a separate period.

                              <span>The UK government’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is concerned that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard could “substantially lessen competition” in consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.
According to a public notice from the CMA, it is concerned that should Microsoft purchase Activision Blizzard, it would harm rivals by refusing access to the company’s games, such as Overwatch or Call of Duty, or providing access on bad terms.
The CMA said it received evidence about the “potential impact” of combining Activision Blizzard with Microsoft’s broader ecosystem. It feels the latter could “leverage Activision Blizzard’s games” with its strength across console, cloud, and PC operating systems to “damage competition in the nascent market” for cloud gaming services.

                              <span>I find that there’s quite the divide between video games and cinema, and that isn’t necessarily a problem for either industry, but Sam Barlow’s latest game – Immortality – shows just how powerful intertwining the two can be, when done effectively. 
Jean-Luc Godard, a renowned French-Swiss film director and critic, once said “a story should have a beginning, middle, and an end… but not necessarily in that order.” Immortality is perhaps one of the most ideal examples of Godard’s words in practice. As you try to unravel the mystery of Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage), you find yourself using a Moviola, threading together random clips from the three movies that she starred in.
Marcel’s first film, Ambrosio, borrows its plot from the Gothic novel, The Monk. It’s equal parts sexy and unnerving, and the temptress character that Marcel plays seems to flow into her next film, too. Minsky followed a year later with a new director, John Durick, and saw Marcel play an artist’s muse in a murder-mystery. Finally, 20 years later, Marcel worked on Two of Everything – once again with John Durick, and after a period of inactivity from the actress. In this one, the tone is even darker than before; Marcel plays a successful pop-star with a body double, but everything goes awry.

With Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family, five accounts share the benefits of Game Pass Ultimate, allowing you, your family, and friends to play the Game Pass library of games on console, PC, and cloud together.

                              <span>MultiVersus has announced that Gizmo, the adorable mogwai from the iconic 80s horror-comedy Gremlins, will be joining the roster of playable characters. While not the biggest fan of fighting games, but this little dude will almost certainly have me diving into MultiVersus again when he’s released on Tuesday, 6 September.
Whenever September rolls around, I immediately begin to feel autumnal, even if the sun is still shining. You know that it’s a matter of time before Halloween rolls around, then Christmas, and then the New Year. It all goes far too fast, but there is one thing that I love about this type of year; watching all the seasonal films that feel wrong to watch at any other time.
I think the team at Player First Games must share similar sentiments, because one of these films is Gremlins. So, introducing Gizmo as we approach autumn feels like perfect timing; especially when we know Stripe is also right around the corner.

                              <span>YuGiOh Cross Duel, the four-player digital card game announced a while back by Konami, is launching on mobile platforms September 6. In this version of YuGiOh, four players take up a slot in a four-way free for all, sending monsters towards other players via lanes.
In addition, there are cooperative modes present that have each of the four players face off against one giant, hugely powerful monster in the centre of the board. If you’re not a fan of all this shiny multiplayer content, then single player modes will also be available on launch.
As with prior YuGiOh games, fans of the old TV shows can expect to see a variety of characters they recognise pop up in-game, so you can represent your favourite version of the YuGiOh cartoon. Plus, this game has some pretty neat 3D models of some of the more iconic monsters, which is sure to mean a lot to those of you out there with a love for the series’ greatest hits.

                              <span>There’s a supermarket chain here in Europe called Lidl, and if you don’t know what to expect when you enter, it’s baffling. One of the strangest places on earth for the unprepared. The shelves are lined with goods that are almost what you get in other supermarkets – almost. The branding is slightly askew, the brand-famous colours slightly off; the cola is a bit more burgundy, the chocolate a more muted shade of purple. The Oreos are called Neos, for some reason. It’s like wandering into a peculiar – significantly cheaper – otherworld. 

That’s what Islets is to Hollow Knight. It’s the off-brand, cheaply-made budget version of everyone’s favourite premium Metroidvania. You can tell exactly what it’s going for – the combat, the aesthetic, the level design, the enemies, and even the graves of the humongous creatures that came before… they’re all there, and intact. But instead of that painterly style Team Cherry has injected into the doomed undergrowth of Hollow knight, you’ve got this Flash game aesthetic. Instead of a rich, sweeping soundscape, you’ve got a hodgepodge collection of sound effects and some much more simplistic music. 
But none of that is bad. In fact, the simplicity of it all – this decidedly off-brand feel – works in the game’s favour. It means you don’t get too distracted from the cool mechanics, from the simple-but-effective combat, from the tight platforming. Everything on-screen is readable, simple to parse: the cracks at the end of this map? That’s a secret, for sure. The big pink glowing skeleton circling this block? That’ll hurt you if you touch it. This rotating red circle in the middle of your airship? Well, that’ll be your hitbox.

                              <span>I’ll come clean. I’m writing this well in advance of publication as I’m going on holiday. I usually spend literal minutes coming up with a brilliant way to segue into the topic of the week’s podcast. It is often very brilliant and hilarious.
The relationship between me and the podcast article is complicated. It’s not easy. It requires work for it to be the best it can be. You can’t just turn up and hope to have a great podcast article without trying your hardest.
Sometimes I even hold a little ceremony before I write the article, just to show how serious I am about writing it. It’s a big deal, so I have to make sure I’ve thought it through properly. But I’m not doing that today, because of the holiday reason I mentioned above – a holiday I’m taking after writing the article, which is in no way related to the topic of the podcast.

                              <span>It was a weird year for Gamescom in 2022; with the absence of two of the big three (and Microsoft only making a showing of a few Game Pass hits), the schedule was cleared for smaller publishers to put their best foot forward and show off the goods. The result? A pretty interesting and esoteric show, with a massive focus on horror, and with the spotlight shining bright on studios that may otherwise have been overshadowed by their first-party peers.

Smaller publishers, then, had a killer show. Whether that was Koch with System Shock, Dead Island 2, and Goat Simulator 3, or Krafton with Moonbreaker and The Callisto Protocol, the not-Ubisofts and not-Microsofts of Gamescom made a lasting impact. But amongst them all, there was one publisher that really stood out to me, and you’ll probably be able to guess who that was based on the coverage myself and Alex Donaldson have put out from the show to date. It was Focus Home Interactive.
First up, there’s Evil West: a game which sells you as a Wild West Superhero, armed to the teeth and pissed off about the vampire threat that threatens to shake the frontier lands of a fledgling USA. Part-Bulletstorm, part-Devil May Cry, and part-Clint Eastwood via Tarantino Western B-movie, Evil West has everything I want from my action games in 2022. Explosions, foul mouths, tight and responsive gameplay, and the most ludicrous, over-the-top nonsense you could ask for.

                              <span>We finally have a proper, long look at Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn&#x27;s gameplay. At gamescom, developer A44 brought a new build of the game to show off to the press, and subsequently released a new trailer with a deeper look at gameplay.
As a follow-up to Ashen, Flintlock was always assumed to be a Souls-like in some ways. While this remains true, the game is leaning harder into God of War and even spectacle fighters than it initially appeared.
At five minutes-long, the video starts off simple; showing off the meaty hatchet combat and how the flintlock pistol fits into the flow. But it quickly skips to the more involved parts of the action. When near death, enemies appear to glow like in the modern Doom games, and catching them in that window delivers a God of War-like finisher.

                              <span>Sons of the Forest, the survival horror title initially planned for a close-to-Halloween release, has been delayed one last time to February 2023.
According to a tweet from the official Twitter account for the game, this delay is so the team can “complete the polish we feel is needed”. Bittersweet news for those who have been crossing their fingers for this title as a late-in-the-year treat.
However, as Sons of the Forest is the sequel to the hugely popular PC horror title The Forest, the importance of nailing a first impression makes sense. The prior game quickly became one of the most popular spooky experiences on the platform, meaning there’s a lot of hype out there for what Endnight Games has in store.

                              <span>As governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of publisher Activision Blizzard grows - particularly in relation to its impact on PlayStation - Microsoft has revealed a commitment to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Sony&#x27;s existing marketing deal.


That&#x27;s according to a statement given to The Verge in which Microsoft said the commitment was made by Xbox boss Phil Spencer to PlayStation head Jim Ryan earlier this year and formalised in a signed agreement.


&quot;In January,&quot; Spencer told The Verge in part of a statement shared by the publication, &quot;we provided a signed agreement to Sony to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract, an offer that goes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements&quot;.

                              <span>Developer 1047 Games has announced it will be &quot;ending feature development&quot; on its acclaimed free-to-play sci-fi shooter Splitgate in order to shift its focus to creating a new game in the same universe.


Splitgate - which has been described as &quot;Halo meets Portal&quot; in some quarters - made quite the splash last year. Despite having been around on PC since May 2019, an open crossplay beta for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC proved so popular that 1047 Games elected to delay the game&#x27;s multi-platform early access launch in order to better accommodate its unexpected surge in popularity.


1047 Games has continued to build on that success in the months since, most recently launching Splitgate&#x27;s beta season two in July. However, the developer has now said it will be &quot;ending feature development&quot; on the game as a result of what it seemingly considers to be insurmountable legacy issues.

The 100-second clip comes courtesy of GameInformer, and features a bit of ultraviolence against new bipedal lizard foes known as Grims.


While a lot of it appears to be business as usual for God of War (Kratos still has his Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos, and Atreus retains his beloved bow and arrow), an accompanying write-up details some new combat additions, including Weapon Signature Moves.

                              <span>18 Capcom classics will come pre-loaded on the Evercade EXP.


Evercade&#x27;s new retro game handheld was announced earlier this year by Blaze Entertainment, and builds on past hardware by adding a better screen, built-in Wi-Fi, and a new pair of triggers. 


Today, we learned that it would also come with 14 Capcom arcade games and four more home console titles packed in, including Street Fighter 2: Hyper Fighting, Mega Man and Breath of Fire.

                              <span>Our Chris is back from Gamescom and he&#x27;s pooped, yet despite that, it sounds as though he had a nice time. Who needs all the hullabaloo when a quieter event allows smaller games some air? 
In today&#x27;s episode of Weekly, Chris takes us back there, to Gamescom, sharing what it was like on the show floor, as well as the games that caught his eye and the gossip he heard. It&#x27;s particularly entertaining to hear about his meeting with Callisto Protocol boss Glen Schofield, who seems to have left quite an impression - an impression Chris delightfully re-enacts.
We also dive into the big review of the week, Immortality, which Chris wrote. This is the new game from Her Story and Telling Lies developer Sam Barlow, so it arrives with anticipation. And it seems it dazzlingly lives up to it. And here we hear why.

                              <span>A touching tribute from Naughty Dog can be found in the newly-released Last of Us Part 1 for the PlayStation 5. 


This tribute recognises the work of Visual Arts producer Daniel Kinnard, who passed away during the game&#x27;s production.


His image can be seen immortalised within the game, where the developer has been reimagined as a pro baseball player for the Denver Skulls on a poster adorning the walls of the farmhouse players search when looking for Ellie.

GoldenEye 007 has been given a Mario-inspired makeover, which sees a multitude of Koopas patrolling through a custom-made version of Nintendo 64&#x27;s Bomb-omb Battlefield with KF7 Soviet rifles and hand grenades.
Of course, the turtle-like foot soldiers and their Bob-omb comrades do not stand a chance against this Bond-like Mario protagonist and his own weaponary.

A few days ago, a logo for the plan, which was reportedly scraped from Xbox&#x27;s backend system, surfaced online.
Xbox has now made an official announcement unveiling the new plan, including details on what exactly it includes and pricing.

Riley and Rochelle from Sheinman Games will take players on a deductive journey, following the lives of two singers from two different backgrounds who fall in love... and also fall apart.


Players will create their own documentary about the two stars as they &quot;take a nuanced yet insider look at the pop culture world&quot; of the &#x27;90s. Diary entries, along with a catalogue of Riley and Rochelle&#x27;s older records, will work as a framework for the narrative, with the developer stating &quot;the player will choose how they want the film to end, and who gets to come out on top.&quot; Here&#x27;s a trailer:

(No, not like Ditto. Or those Pokémon that Mewtwo made in the movie.)


Pocket Monster Issue is a popular smartphone game in the country, and has been running for more than five years. According to the South China Morning Post (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), The Pokémon Company is seeking damages worth 500 million yuan (around £62m), and a series of public apologies posted on major gaming websites.

                              <span>Indie Gladiator game Domina has been delisted from Steam, after its developer went off on a transphobic rant.


Developer Nicholas John Leonhard Groissen took it upon himself to use his game as a platform to spout these comments in a recent &#x27;update&#x27; announcing Domina&#x27;s new name - Dominus.


&quot;We&#x27;re Out of Ideas, Mentally Unstable, Totally Degenerate, &amp; Desperate for Clout - Let&#x27;s Pretend We&#x27;re A Completely Different Game to Regain Relevance!&quot; the post began.

                              <span>After two years of operation, Nintendo has decided to scrub Mario Kart Tour of its gacha-like elements. 


Nintendo&#x27;s smartphone version of Mario Kart currently allows you to dump currency into an in-game warp pipe in exchange for randomised rewards, such as characters and karts. 


This will soon be replaced by a Fortnite-style rotating item shop, where you can exchange currency for items directly.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We&#x27;ve Been Playing,

Poinpy is one of the first Netflix games, a surprisingly great selection of smartphone treats that are worryingly easy to miss or forget about, given the streaming giant&#x27;s slightly odd rollout.

                              <span>We&#x27;d been waiting a little while to learn something concrete about Creative Assembly&#x27;s long-rumoured first-person shooter, but when Hyenas was finally revealed, the response was maybe a little muted. Hyenas was a surprise: Creative Assembly had been an entirely strategy-based studio for decades until it released Alien Isolation, a small, considered first-person game. A multiplayer, co-op, character-based shooter with a loud and brash tone doesn&#x27;t seem like the most natural follow-up.
But then, Alien Isolation wasn&#x27;t exactly a natural follow-up to Total War, and speaking to Eurogamer at Gamescom, product director Alex Hunnisett explained that, actually, these games are rarely interlinked - despite some staff from within the studio moving across to work on it.
&quot;Really, when we were looking at Hyenas, it was a case of going, well, what are folks enjoying playing at the moment, for starters, and the great thing about working in a studio is often you&#x27;re enjoying doing something, you&#x27;ve got enough capable people around you just go, &#x27;let&#x27;s just do that then.&#x27;&quot; Aside from the fact that both games are set in space, he said, that&#x27;s really where the similarities or shared inspirations end. Hyenas, like Alien Isolation before it, is very much its own thing.

                              <span>G2 Esports has announced a brand new all-female League of Legends team, one of the first of its kind.


The team, called Hel, is named after Norse mythology&#x27;s goddess of death and includes the elite players Olivia &quot;Olizia&quot; Nnenna Calistus, Agnė &quot;Karina&quot; Ivaškevičiūtė, Alena &quot;TIFA&quot; Maurer, Maya &quot;Caltys&quot; Henckel and Ève &quot;Colomblbl&quot; Monvoisin.


It follows the similarly all-female Valorant team G2 Gozen formed last year and proves G2&#x27;s commitment to boosting the visibility of women in esports and to eventually empower men and women to compete together in future.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s acclaimed Medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is set to make its historical tapestry a little richer next Thursday, 8th September, with the arrival of the Friends and Foes Event Pack DLC, promising over a hundred new events.


These new player-driven stories, which can be encountered throughout ordinary play, all have relationships at their heart, but not necessarily the positive kind. One the one hand, players can &quot;uncover novel ways to become pals with those [they] hold dear or even achieve the coveted best friend status&quot;, but on the other, Paradox says players should &quot;be prepared for ever more dangerous rivals, sharpening their vengeful knives to get back at you.&quot;


Stories are at the heart of Crusader Kings 3, so more narrative options are always welcome, but those uninterested in laying down cash for the Friends &amp; Foes Event Pack will also have something to look forward to - a number of additional free features and changes will be arriving simultaneously as part of the new 1.7 Bastion Update.

                              <span>At Gamescom I sat down with a lovely ice cold beer and two lovely lads who ran me through military real-time tactics sequel Men Of War II in a 45-minute hands-off presentation. As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game&#x27;s early missions, I can genuinely say that I&#x27;d be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I&#x27;d genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

                              <span>Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don&#x27;t want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey &quot;retro&quot; would completely misrepresent it. It&#x27;s beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It&#x27;s translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It&#x27;s a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It&#x27;s vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I&#x27;m so glad I got to play it.

                              <span>Real-time tactics game Men Of War 2 has been pushed to 2023 to incorporate more features and content sparked by feedback from closed playtests. Developers Best Way and publishers Fulqrum say the impact of having to pause development because of the outbreak of war in Best Way’s home country of Ukraine has led them to take extra time on the game for these to be implemented. Watch the latest trailer below.

                              <span>So two weeks ago I let you know that Vampire Survivors wouldn’t be getting any more patches before it launched into its 1.0 version. The cheeky scamps at poncle have only gone and made me look like a right sausage today, surprise announcing another patch. This time, they’re adding in a new game mode, quick start, and a very odd new character.

                              <span>Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

                              <span>Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

                              <span>First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

He’ll arrive on Tuesday, ahead of the already announced Stripe, Gremlins&#x27; big (small) bad.

                              <span>Inti Creates have earned themselves a reputation in recent years, through titles like Blaster Master Zero and the Azure Striker Gunvolt series, of creating visually-intricate and technical 2D platformers. Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

                              <span>Halo series stewards 343 Industries have given a rather sombre update on the state of Halo Infinite’s future, and there’s a lot of delays and cancellations. The game’s campaign network co-op, season 3 of multiplayer, and Forge mode have been pushed back, and couch co-op outright cancelled. And if there’s one thing about Halo that you don’t mess with then it would seem that’s couch co-op.

                              <span>Leaked Assassin’s Creed game Mirage is real, Ubisoft have confirmed, and they’re planning to show more of it at next week’s Ubisoft Forward event. All we know for sure so far is that the game exists, it’s definitely called Mirage, and returns to the Middle Eastern setting of the original Assassin’s Creed. I rather like the blue highlights to the assassin’s robes in this one.

                              <span>As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don&#x27;t have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

Kiwix is an offline content reader, best known
for distributing copies of Wikipedia. I have been maintaining it in Debian
since 2017.
This year most of the work has been keeping all the packages up to date in anticipation of next year&#x27;s Debian 12 Bookworm release,
including several transitions
for new libzim and libkiwix versions.
libzim: 6.3.0 → 8.0.0
zim-tools: 2.1.0 → 3.1.1
python-libzim: 0.0.3 → 1.1.1 (with a cherry-picked patch)
libkiwix: 9.4.1 → 11.0.0 (with DFSG issues fixed!)
kiwix-tools: 3.1.2 → 3.3.0
kiwix (desktop): 2.0.5 → 2.2.2
The Debian Package Tracker
makes it really easy to keep an eye on all Kiwix-related packages.
All of the &quot;user-facing&quot; packages (zim-tools, kiwix-tools, kiwix) now have
very basic autopkgtests that can provide a
bit of confidence that the package isn&#x27;t totally broken. I recommend reading
the &quot;FAQ for package maintainers&quot;
to learn about all the benefits you get from having autopkgtests.
Finally, back in March I wrote a blog post, How to mirror the Russian Wikipedia with Debian and Kiwix,
which got significant readership (compared to most posts on this blog), including
being quoted by LWN!
We are always looking for more contributors, please reach out if you&#x27;re
interested. The Kiwix team is one of my favorite groups of people to work
with and they love Debian too.</span>

Well, yes.  In fact, I’ve already done it.
What is sneakernet?
Normally, “sneakernet” is a sort of tongue-in-cheek reference to using disconnected storage to transport data or messages.  By “disconnect storage” I mean anything like CD-ROMs, hard drives, SD cards, USB drives, and so forth.  There are times when loading up 12TB on a device and driving it across town is just faster and easier than using the Internet for the same.  And, sometimes you need to get data to places that have no Internet at all.
Another reason for sneakernet is security.  For instance, if your backup system is online, and your systems be…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say that eyebrows were both raised and furrowed when Sega first shared footage of Sonic Frontiers back in June, but its latest trailer - a three-minute overview video breaking down the various features and gameplay flow of Sonic&#x27;s latest adventure - offers the clearest explanation yet of how things will unfold come its launch on 8th November if you&#x27;re still a little puzzled by the whole thing.


Granted, Sega&#x27;s plentiful, if scattershot, drip-feed of information over the last few months means none of the information in today&#x27;s trailer is particularly new, but it&#x27;s certainly more digestible - and understandable - than trying to mentally scoop together a picture of Sonic Frontiers from countless previews and reveals.


The gist, then, is that having somehow found his way into a strange dimension known as Cyber Space, Sonic escapes to Kronos - one of the Starfall Islands where players will be able to embark on Frontiers&#x27; non-linear &quot;open zone&quot; gameplay. Here, high-speed exploration and puzzling are the order of the day, with successful puzzling unlocking items that&#x27;ll increase Sonic&#x27;s power and defence and revealing new parts of each map.

                              <span>Warner Bros is teasing the imminent arrival of Gremlins&#x27; adorable mogwai Gizmo to its free-to-play crossover fighter MultiVersus, with the company&#x27;s announcement pointing to a release next Tuesday, 6th September.


Although Warner Bros is yet to refer to Gizmo directly, a teaser trailer released today on Twitter shows a pair of very Gizmo-like hands and eyes popping out of the distinctive box used to transport the character in Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch.


What makes the Gizmo tease particularly interesting is that (despite Gizmo&#x27;s inclusion in the playable roster having been leaked earlier this year) the only Gremlins character so for officially confirmed for MultiVersus is Gizmo&#x27;s arch-nemesis Stripe.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has unveiled Toxoids, a new Species Pack DLC for Stellaris that&#x27;ll bring the &quot;most stubborn species in the game&#x27;s history&quot; when it comes to PC on 20th September.


Toxoids will give players the tools to &quot;gamble the future of their planets for immediate gains&quot; on release, with empires featuring the new species able to grow and adapt faster than most creatures - albeit often with nasty consequences for their neighbours and themselves.


To that end, the expansion introduces two new Origins: Knights of the Toxic God and Overtuned. The former revolves around a mysterious power rumoured to be buried under toxic sludge which can be unleashed on the galaxy if found, while the latter gives players the chance to play as a species able to gain more and more traits at the expense of their own lifespan.

                              <span>In October 2019, global pop sensation Lady Gaga appeared confused as to what Fortnite was. 


&quot;What&#x27;s fortnight?&quot; Gaga tweeted, elliciting numerous responses.


One reply, from blue-haired Fortnite streamer Ninja, asked Gaga to play with him. &quot;who are you,&quot; was Gaga&#x27;s response.

With all the bizarre ways of playing, this feels inevitable right?


The one-handed run was already an impressive feat - especially as it was quickly followed by a one-handed level one All Remembrance run - but now she&#x27;s playing with her feet instead.

                              <span>343 Industries has shared its latest development roadmap, and it&#x27;s not good news. 


The biggest news is that the game&#x27;s next season has been delayed to March 2023. That&#x27;s an excruciatingly long time to wait. For context, Battlefield 2042, which released around the same time and also suffered delays, is also on Season 2, with the next Season planned for the end of this year. 


The bad news doesn&#x27;t end there, as split-screen local co-op has now been cancelled outright. &quot;In order to improve and accelerate ongoing live service development, and to better address player feedback and quality of life updates, we have reallocated studio resources and are no longer working on local campaign split-screen co-op,&quot; 343 said in an accompany development video.

                              <span>For those that had hoped to see upcoming space horror The Callisto Protocol make its way onto Xbox Games Pass at  release, this seems unlikely. 


Chatting to TrueAchievements, Striking Distance Studios&#x27; chief technology officer Mark James said the Game Pass model was a &quot;difficult&quot; one in financial terms for independent studios with single-player games - something The Callisto Protocol is.


&quot;I think those services are built towards some of the open-world style and repetitive multiplayer games. I think games [like that] survive well on that service,&quot; James said when discussing the possibility of seeing a title like The Callisto Protocol joining Game Pass.

Now Corecell, the Thai developer behind AeternoBlade 2, has released a damning statement against the publisher to &quot;help other indie game developers to avoid what has happened to us and inform our fans about our situation&quot;.

The talk revealed new details about the software that will help developers in creating for or porting onto PSVR2 (reported by IGN).

Nia Nal, otherwise known as Dreamer, debuted in the fourth season of Arrowverse series Supergirl, and was the first trans superhero in a TV show. By extension, this also makes Dreamer the first character confirmed as trans in Fortnite.


Dreamer will be available via Fortnite&#x27;s Item Shop later in the event, following a Zero Build Squads tournament where winners can collect the character early. Dreamer&#x27;s TV actress Nicole Maines is also on board, and will be streaming Fortnite in-character next week.

                              <span>The Last of Us on PS3 was a boundary-pushing title with stunning graphics and animation. Novel techniques - like capsule shadows and real-time bounce lighting - alongside ruthless attention to detail produced one of the most technically accomplished games in its time, even though it often failed to reach its 30fps target, frequently dipping into the mid-20s in combat and traversal sequences. Enter The Last of Us Part 1.
Some nine-and-a-half years after its original release, The Last of Us has been fully remade with modern technology on PS5 hardware. With an advanced suite of graphics tech in tow, does the remake also blow past its frame-time budgets? Or has Naughty Dog more sensibly balanced visual beauty with fluid frame-rates? 
The Last of Us Part 1 offers players five genuine visual modes, engaged through various selections and system-level tweaks. With the PS5 set to 60Hz output, you get the option of a fidelity mode that offers 4K visuals with a 30fps target framerate, alongside a performance mode that advertises dynamic 4K visuals or native 1440p visuals depending on your output resolution - but actually delivers 1440p regardless. With 120Hz engaged, you get the same options, though the fidelity mode now promises a 40fps framerate target. As an additional modifier, engaging both 120Hz and VRR gives you the option to &#x27;unlock&#x27; the 120Hz options, maximising frame-rate and using VRR to smooth out any inconsistencies.

The Pokémon has been teased all week with a series of images taken by a Paldean photographer featuring brightly coloured markings in a forest.


Now, in a new documentary format video, we finally got a look at the little painter.

                              <span>Recently we&#x27;ve seen a flurry of announcements and releases for Soulslike games. From the recently released Thymesia and next week&#x27;s Steel Rising, through to 2023&#x27;s Pinocchio inspired Lies of P it feels like everyone and their dog is jumping on the action RPG bandwagon at the moment.
After watching a 15 minute, hands-off presentation last week, I can also confirm that Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is most definitely a Soulslike action RPG too. However, this &#x27;magic meets gunpowder technology&#x27; fantasy title seems to be a little braver than other games in the genre as it&#x27;s not afraid to be releasing with optional difficulty settings.
This means anyone who wants to experience Flintlock without fear of being punished by some very intense action will be able to tailor the experience to suit their skill level. During the presentation the developers, A44 Games did stress that there is a specific default difficulty for the game though, and this will allow you to maintain the authenticity of the experience and play the game as originally intended.

                              <span>Men of War 2, the sequel to the original cult RTS Men of War, will now release in 2023.


Developed by Ukrainian studio Best Way, this release has been delayed in order to &quot;accommodate new features and content suggested by its fans and improve the game itself&quot;. The development team noted that, due to the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine, these improvements would not be possible to facilitate within the original timeframe. 


Along with this announcement, the developer also shared a new trailer for Men of War 2. This is titled &#x27;The Price of Victory&#x27;, and can be watched below.

As you would expect, Call of Duty, Overwatch and Diablo will be made available via Xbox Game Pass, Spencer said, if and when Microsoft&#x27;s $68bn buyout of Activision Blizzard is completed.


Spencer also made the guarantee that Xbox was &quot;committed to making the same version of Call of Duty available on PlayStation on the same day the game launches elsewhere&quot;.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority has concluded its initial investigation of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, making the decision that the deal requires a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; investigation. 


In its report, the CMA has determined that the deal will be &quot;giving rise to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


Crucially, the CMA decided the deal would have a large impact on the success of rival platforms: &quot;Evidence consistently pointed towards ABK&#x27;s content, especially Call of Duty, as being important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals&#x27; gaming platforms.&quot;

                              <span>A new trailer for Tchia has been released, giving us a closer look at the game&#x27;s tropical, New Caledonia-inspired setting. 


This trailer is narrated by the game&#x27;s director, Phil Crifo, and takes us from the island&#x27;s high peaks to the bottom of its azure ocean. Along the way, we are shown various methods of getting around the island in action. This includes things such as Tchia catapulting herself from the tops of trees and then gliding her way through the sky.


We also get another look at the game&#x27;s soul-jumping ability, which allows Tchia to quickly hop into the body of almost any animal or inanimate object she can find. This proves useful when she comes across the Maano, the game&#x27;s &quot;strange fabric creatures&quot; that have invaded Tchia&#x27;s home. In this case, she becomes a lantern, before later on becoming a coconut. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

The Australian Classification Board has jumped the gun and published its classification early, and it makes for a humorous read.  


The ACB warns that the game depicts &quot;tracking and killing of numerous opponents, with resulting examples of blood and injury detail.&quot;

The update, which is available right now for beta users, improves the algorithm that powers game searches. 


Search for games on the Xbox app has been notoriously bad up until this point, igniting the console wars between PlayStation and Xbox fans since the PlayStation is relatively good at finding what you want.

                              <span>Promotional artwork for the still-unannounced Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage has popped up online, apparently from Ubisoft&#x27;s own store. 


The image, shared on Twitter by Assassin&#x27;s Creed fansite The Codex Network, appears to be for some kind of bonus quest. It shows a hooded Assassin hero armed with the series&#x27; iconic hidden blade weapon, facing down the silhouette of an enemy with a curved sword. 


Setting a story mission around the famous fable of The Forty Thieves would mirror other such bonus quests offered by Ubisoft in the past, such as a Beowulf-themed story for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla.

                              <span>What do you think of when you hear the words &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;? Do you remember being absorbed for hours as a child, hurriedly flipping pages and rolling dice, hoping you&#x27;d chosen the right path? Perhaps you talked about it with friends in the schoolyard, swapping strategies, comparing notes. You almost certainly remembered the deaths.
Whatever you remember of it, the effect the books had is undeniable. More than 20 million copies have been sold, making writers Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson best-selling authors, in addition to all of the other plaudits they&#x27;ve received. In fact, few people are as decorated in the games industry.
And this year, Fighting Fantasy turns 40 years old, just like me. And in celebration, two new books are being released: Shadow of the Giants, by Livingstone, and Secrets of Salamonis, by Jackson. And they&#x27;re coming out today - Thursday, 1st September.

Sons of the Forest is the direct sequel to Endnight&#x27;s well-received The Forest (which got its version 1.0 release in 2018 after four years in early access), a game that combined the survival genre&#x27;s penchant for scavenging and crafting with a genuinely unnerving horror element as protagonist Eric Leblanc searched the titular, cannibal-infested forest for his son following a harrowing plane crash.


Sons of the Forest, which this time sees players tracking down a  missing billionaire on a remote island, was originally due to launch in May this year, but Endnight made the decision to postpone its release to October in order to deliver its &quot;vision of the next step in survival games&quot;.

                              <span>It’s that time again, Rocket League fans. Season 8 is almost here, going live September 7 following an in-game update the previous day at 4PM PDT.
This season is bringing the Honda Civic Type R as the first real life car present in a seasonal battle pass, a new arena, a returning event and of course a new pass for players to progress through.
According to the Urban Dictionary, a Civic driver is “A usually white and slightly poor male who wears flat-brimmed hats or beanies, has tattoos and an ego larger then the federal deficit”. Having seen people matching this description out in the wild in the UK, this car is the perfect addition for a certain portion of the Rocket League community. Better yet, this is the Type R version, which can only be a good thing. In game, it has a Octane hitbox.

                              <span>This year’s Gamescom was a strange one. The first year back after the pandemic, many of gaming’s biggest publishers decided to skip the show – which had the welcome effect of shining a brighter spotlight on many games and publishers that usually might have to jostle with the bigger multinational corporations for attention. French publisher Focus Home Interactive, previously best known for games like A Plague Tale and Vampyr, had the best line-up of the show. But another beneficiary of the no-shows was undoubtedly Xbox.

The only one of the ‘big three’ to show up, Xbox had ‘won’ the Gamescom hardware manufacturer competition before the show had even begun. But even then, I looked upon its line-up for the show with my brow furrowed. Is this it? This is a paltry offering. Not even a crumb of Starfield? But now I must hold my hands up. Mea culpa – I was wrong. It was a great line-up – for what it was.

Sure enough, it didn’t have the big-name announcements you might most desire. The biggest first-party games down on the Xbox stand were simply updates to existing rolling service games like Sea of Thieves and Grounded. The booth was dominated by attention-grabbing, line-up distracting photo ops. And, bluntly, there were a laughable number of stations to play – if you managed to get on anything in that stand during the public visiting hours, you were very lucky indeed.

                              <span>I’ll never forget when Super Smash Bros. Ultimate crash landed into my life. To be frank, things got a little bit out of hand, and shortly after launch, my work friends and I were often staying for hours at the end of the day to battle it out. Lunch times were completely consumed by it, we even organised tournaments at local bars so that we would never have to stop playing. Eight-players, as many items as possible, and game after game of exquisitely-designed party brawler fun.

When I look back on these times however, it’s not all Mario Sunshine and Rainbow Roads. No matter how brilliant, just how completely perfect Super Smash Bros. Ultimate felt in a group, there was always the looming presence of Super Smash Bros. at home. Anyone who’s played Super Smash Bros. Ultimate alone online will know it’s an absolutely miserable experience. 

Even though I’d confidently rank Super Smash Bros. Ultimate among my favourite games ever made, the frequently laggy and downright ancient online capabilities make it a game of two sides. As the pandemic brought down a hammer on in-person meetups and shattered any hopes of LAN parties across the world, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate became a chore to even open, and after a while I simply put it down. I’ve no doubt that if the online actually functioned, I’d probably still be playing every single day, if only for a game or two.

“We had high hopes that we had created something that fans would love, but the response has exceeded all expectations. We’d like to send a massive thank you to all of the players who are showing support by building their wild and wonderful campuses – we can’t wait to see what more you’ll create.”

                              <span>Tekken 7 has a substantial cheating problem, and it’s been a major blemish on an otherwise excellent fighter ever since it was released back in 2015. With the tease of a new Tekken project shown off during Evo, and the transition from this fan-favourite 3D brawler to something fresh in the foreseeable future, there’s a substantial worry that Tekken 7 will be left in the lurch forever.
To find out as much about the cheating situation in Tekken 7, we reached out to professional players, content creators, and ordinary Tekken enthusiasts to learn their experiences with the online experience, what forms of cheating are present, and how they hope future instalments of Tekken will battle these issues.
To start, it’s important to break down what ‘cheating’ actually means in the context of Tekken 7. When most people think of cheats in modern multiplayer titles, they think of exterior programs that provide a distinct advantage over other players with the most infamous examples being aimbots and wall hacks in FPS titles.

                              <span>Another series of allegations have been levied against UK-based indie game publisher PQube. This time, claims of mistreatment come from Corecell Technologies, who had their indie action title Aeterno Blade 2 published in Europe by PQube back in 2019.
According to an official post made by Corecell Technologies only a few minutes ago, Corecell claims that PQube has “only paid a small part of the minimum guarantee of the signing milestone  by the time we sent them the game and they never paid the remaining milestones”.
A minimum guarantee, generally speaking in the context of video game marketing and publishing, is an agreed upon sum of money that a publisher will pay to the developer of a game over the course of the partnership. It’s a minimum guarantee of funds, that is meant to go to the devs as they meet certain development milestones.

Called Grafaiai, the toxic monkey Pokemon is a Normal/Poison-type with the abilities Unburden and Poison Touch.
It apparently likes to claim territory by painting trees in the area. How this works is the nocturnal Pokemon licks its hands and fingers to cover them in poison. It then uses this poison paint on the trees, which in turn paralyzes Bug Pokemon drawn to the saliva’s sweet, fragrant scent.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Innocence was a breakout hit: it came from pretty much nowhere, infested the minds of gamers the world over, and gnawed through any preconceptions of what everyone thought would be just another stealth game’. Asobo Studio picked up accolades ranging from best narrative, best art direction and studio of the year – as well as a slew of Game of the Year awards – for its sleeper hit effort with the first game in the series. And rightly so; rarely do we see stories so affecting, so artfully done, and so sublimely grotesque… all at the same time. 

So, following up with A Plague Tale: Requiem was never going to be an easy feat. Asobo wasn’t even sure if it’d get to make a sequel to the game whilst the original was in development – and that’s probably for the best. It means the original story wasn’t chopped up, butchered, and Frankenstein’d back together for the sake of a sequel. It means that each game retains its own identity, its own outlook, and its own take on where storytelling and mechanics intersect. It means that Requiem, from what we’ve seen so far, is even more harrowing than its predecessor.
From a top-down view, Requiem is very much more of the same: high fidelity graphics, an emphasis on stealth, deep and unsettling horror thumbed into every pore of the game. Wherever you do, there’s the chattering of rats and the pungent smell of death – this is a world where Europe is still in the grips of a heaving infestation, after all. Your actions in the last game haven’t solved the vermin epidemic. But where the first game made you feel underpowered and vulnerable, just children trying to survive in a world utterly hostile to life, Requiem makes you the threat – in some quietly horrifying ways.

                              <span>Some artwork purportedly from the rumored Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage has surfaced online.
Reportedly pulled from the Ubisoft Store, the image shows the back of a person wearing assassin&#x27;s garb, and we presume this person is Basim from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, as rumored.
The leak (thanks, RPS) comes from Assassin’s Creed community The Codex Network, which credited Synth Potato for providing the image, which was also shared by leaker ScriptLeaksR6. Some accounts removed the image due to DMCA notices.

                              <span>Microsoft intends to add Activision Blizzard’s library of games to Game Pass, particularly Call of Duty, Diablo, and Overwatch. 
That&#x27;s according to an open letter discussing the Activision Blizzard acquisition penned by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. 
&quot;Subscription services like Game Pass make gaming more affordable and help players from all over the world find their next favorite game,&quot; said Spencer. &quot;Game Pass empowers developers to bring more games to more players, not fewer.

                              <span>Just yesterday, a rumour emerged that the next Nintendo Direct is much closer than you might’ve though, and it’s going to be packed with news for keen Zelda fans. This report comes directly from Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb in a recent stream to YouTube.
In the video, Grubb suggests that a Nintendo Direct could be happening the week of September 12, which is the same week that the Tokyo Game Show is expected to begin – this does track, given that we have seen a Nintendo Direct every September since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017.
When it comes to what this rumoured Nintendo Direct will feature, Grubb suggests that “I think there’s going to be a lot of Zelda stuff at this thing.” More specifically, it’s believed that Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD ports could very well be coming to Nintendo Switch soon. These titles have been rumoured before, and are also very much titles that fans want to see on the newer console.

As well as the Yeti and Snowball USB microphones that are most likely to be familiar to you, there&#x27;s also a rare 42% discount on the Blue Blackout Spark XLR mic - nice. 
However, the microphones I&#x27;d like to focus on today are those popular options, specifically the Blue Snowball Ice and the Blue Yeti X. These represent the top and the bottom of the Blue spectrum when it comes to gaming-friendly USB mics.

                              <span>The second-best way to make Twitter palatable (after simply unfollowing sources of bad tweets) is to follow a load of curated and bot accounts which trickle niceness into your timeline. Today I&#x27;d like to suggest adding Skybox Satellite, a Twitter account which shows glimpses of the skies wrapped around maps in GoldSrc games like Half-Life and Counter-Strike. It&#x27;s sometimes pretty, sometimes nostalgic, and sometimes impressive.

                              <span>Back at Geoff Fest, I spoke with Glenn Schofield about The Callisto Protocol, its gore system, spiky walls, and batteries. From what I&#x27;d seen and heard, I was keen to see more of the sci-fi horror game that&#x27;s not Dead Space but is also quite like Dead Space.
So, at this year&#x27;s Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios&#x27; chief technology officer Mark James about what I&#x27;d seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

There’s also the upcoming free Bastion update, which introduces memory maps for characters, the loyal and disloyal traits, and revamps childhood events. Have a watch of the trailer for Friends And Foes below, old buddy, old pal.

                              <span>Last week HyperX announced their first-ever gaming monitors, the Armada 25 and Armada 27, and within a couple of days I was being led into their Gamescom booth to try each of them for myself. After a disappointingly uncomfortable preview of the Samsung Odyssey Ark, it was nice to get to grips with a far more utilitarian pair of monitors – albeit not without a party trick of their own, namely HyperX’s Armada Gaming Mount.

Wowzer! Thanks for being with us for this record-breaking feat. We asked for suggestions and received many excellent ones, but in the end we went with a suggestion from Jonathon which, at the time we recorded, I did not realise would be instantly revealed by the episode title. Cheers to you all!

                              <span>Further investigation of Microsoft’s $68.7 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard is needed by the UK’s competition regulator, a statement on the government’s website confirmed today. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began the preliminary stage of their investigation at the beginning of July, with a deadline set for September 1st. That initial stage of investigation found that the deal could “substantially lessen competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services”.

                              <span>Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it&#x27;s acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana&#x27;s surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as &quot;Project Code Name &#x27;M&#x27;&quot; now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

                              <span>There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

                              <span>Today was due to be the day when some older Ubisoft games would see their online services decommissioned, but the company is granting them a temporary reprieve. You now have until October 1st to cram in some multiplayer for several early Assassin’s Creeds, the original version of Far Cry 3, Driver: San Francisco and others. Ubisoft say they’ve been “exploring what is possible to reduce disruption” over the last month, hence the shuffled date for decommissioning.

In any case, power supplies are important, mm&#x27;kay, and this 550W 80+ Gold modular one from Corsair is discounted here in the UK. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay £78 for this model - and at least £65 for one of this spec from a notable brand - but at Currys you can combine a price reduction with the code FNDDGAMING to get this PSU delivered for only £40.

                              <span>The RX 6950 XT is AMD&#x27;s flagship card, a 4K gaming powerhouse that can put almost any game to shame - as long as you don&#x27;t turn on ray tracing, anyway. The card launched at £1100 but often sold for far more, but now we&#x27;re starting to see things slide the other way - and the top AMD GPU now costs only £800 at Overclockers in the UK. That&#x27;s £300 below RRP and a new low-water mark.

                              <span>Nightdive&#x27;s remake of 1994 classic System Shock hasn&#x27;t had the smoothest development run, first having some money issues in its Kickstarter a while back, then having to reboot itself with twenty-twenty-something release dates chucked out there more as hopeful concepts than assurances. 
Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I&#x27;m unsure whether it&#x27;ll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman&#x27;s Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you&#x27;re part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I&#x27;ve been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. &quot;I usually tell people, &#x27;Oh, you should make a game in like six months&#x27;, and I have tried to do that in the past,&quot; he tells me. &quot;This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.&quot; And, while I am sure that most developers don&#x27;t wish they&#x27;d been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

                              <span>Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios&#x27; seminal survival sim.

This time, Liam will be joined by myself (hello!) as we cover the show floor from top to bottom, from when the doors open on Friday, September 2nd until they boot everyone out the evening of Monday, September 25th. We’ll be interviewing developers, attending panels, and sharing our thoughts on the best upcoming games on the show floor.

                              <span>I went into my High On Life hands-on session with one expectation: its talking alien guns will annoy the heck out of me. But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne&#x27;s multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn&#x27;t annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I&#x27;ve played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you&#x27;re a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games&#x27; back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

                              <span>The Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED is the biggest foldable PC, but the company has done little to advance the design of folding computers. It has a beautiful display but is still chunky and expensive.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo is poised to reveal Switch ports of Wii U&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD and The Wind Waker HD according to a new report, with the announcement said to arrive as part of a new Nintendo Direct in September.


That&#x27;s according to GamesBeat managing editor Mike Minotti and the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb who, speaking during Grubb&#x27;s latest Game Mess podcast (thanks VGC), claimed to be &quot;very, very sure&quot; the dual Zelda port announcements were on the way.


&quot;100% there is a Nintendo Direct in September,&quot; said Grubb. &quot;I think there&#x27;s going to be a lot of Zelda stuff at this thing, I think this is going to be a Zelda blowout for Nintendo.&quot;

                              <span>Following July&#x27;s announcement that Ubisoft would be &quot;decommissioning&quot; the online portions of some of its older titles on 1st September, the publisher has said it&#x27;s postponing the move to 1st October in many cases, and that Anno 2070 will now escape unscathed.


Ubisoft originally announced that 15 titles that would be affected by the move: Anno 2070, Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2, Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Brotherhood, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Liberation HD, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations, Driver San Francisco, Far Cry 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, Rayman Legends, Silent Hunter 5, Space Junkies, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and ZombiU.


The precise effects of decommissioning depend on the game, but ranged from the removal of multiplayer modes, online features, and DLC to being unable to access the game at all.

                              <span>Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and its follow-up season Beyond Time and Space will be making their way to Playstation in remastered form on 29th September.


Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space were, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, some of the earliest titles from The Walking Dead studio Telltale Games (releasing in 2006 and 2007 respectively), each serving up a six-episode arc of point-and-click mayhem starring Steve Purcell&#x27;s anarchic comic book crime-fighting dog and bunny duo.


While never quite living up to the lofty heights of LucasArts&#x27; 1993 classic Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road, both games bought their own wonderfully chaotic charms - Save the World&#x27;s story starting with former child stars running amok before taking increasingly bizarre turns, and Beyond Time and Space going even weirder with everything from vampires to Santa Claus.

                              <span>Raphaël Colantonio has revealed that nobody at Arkane Austin wanted Prey (2017) to be titled Prey, and how it felt &quot;gross&quot; to have release something under someone else&#x27;s IP.
Colantonio, known as the founder of Arkane Studios, served as the game&#x27;s director and writer. He announced his departure from the studio shortly after the game&#x27;s release, citing burnout and a desire to spend time with his son.

The fact that the game was never envisioned to be a part of the Prey IP isn&#x27;t new for fans of the game or Arkane. It was documented by NoClip last year, in which Colantonio and other leads on the game explained that Bethesda was insistent that Arkane&#x27;s next project had to be called Prey. Colantonio described the decision as a &quot;non-negotiable compromise&quot;.

Sadly, that does mean it seems Final Fantasy 16 is not set to be shown.

                              <span>Nine years ago, The Last of Us was first released for the PlayStation 3. Here, we met Joel, Ellie and a whole cast of characters making their way in a world riddled with danger and aggression. The game tells a sad story, but also a multi-faceted one. Back in 2013, The Last of Us left its players with a message that hope, humour and unconditional love could still exist, even in a world divided by fear.
Now, the game is being released once more, remade from the ground up for the PlayStation 5. Ahead of this release, I sat down with developers Matthew Gallant and Shaun Escayg to talk about the new accessibility features coming to The Last of Us Part 1, and the business of making what they openly describe as &quot;a love letter&quot; to the game&#x27;s fans.

Please note, there will be spoilers for The Last of Us Part 1 in what follows.

                              <span>When Naughty Dog revealed The Last of Us Part 1 earlier this year, a complete visual remake of the original The Last of Us from 2013, we were a little surprised. There&#x27;s always a debate to be had about the timing of a re-release, and we wondered whether the new version would be different enough from the 2014 PS4 remaster and 2016 PS4 Pro patch to justify a purchase from newcomers to the seasons and series veterans alike. After spending some time with the final release, we have some answers - including comparisons between the new PS5 release and the prior PS3 and PS4 versions, the video modes available and the gameplay changes included. 
First, let&#x27;s rewind. The Last of Us was the PS3&#x27;s swan song, a showpiece title released just months before the arrival of the PS4. The mix of storytelling, survival horror and action resonated with fans, becoming one of Naughty Dog&#x27;s most successful games ever. The technical challenge Naughty Dog created for itself was the creation of a world almost entirely devoid of electric lights - The Last of Us relies heavily on indirect lighting which, in 2013, was still very difficult to achieve even when leaning on pre-calculated techniques. Against the odds, Naughty Dog did manage to come up with a suitable solution to this problem - it&#x27;s far from perfect, mind you, but the world was convincingly lit and designed. The problem was that on PS3, the performance just didn&#x27;t hold up and many larger areas exhibited severe frame-rate issues that detracted from the experience. 
This is where PS4 enters the picture. One year later, Naughty Dog released a Remastered version of the game for the new console offering higher resolutions and a smooth frame-rate - effectively overcoming the issues inherent in the original release. Naughty Dog returned to The Last of Us once again with that PS4 Pro update, allowing for up to native 4K rendering at 30fps. That PS4 Pro code also runs great on PS5, so what more could a native PS5 version offer?

                              <span>The video game acquisitions continue: this time it&#x27;s French developer Quantic Dream, which has been bought by Chinese game company NetEase.


NetEase, which publishes Blizzard&#x27;s mobile game Diablo Immortal, said it had acquired the studio behind Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls without disclosing a fee. NetEase originally acquired a minority stake in Quantic Dream in 2019.

Quantic Dream, led by David Cage and Guillaume de Fondaumière, is now NetEase&#x27;s first studio in Europe. It will &quot;continue to operate independently, focusing on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles, while at the same time leveraging NetEase&#x27;s significant game development capabilities&quot;, the company insisted.

                              <span>New details have emerged about the combat in God of War Ragnarök, including how Kratos can &quot;play with this food&quot;.


The information comes from an interview with lead combat designers Mihir Sheth and Denny Yeh by Game Informer.


In Ragnarök, players will have more options than ever to dish out damage to enemies, controlling both Kratos and Atreus in unison.

                              <span>Dream Cycle is the first game I&#x27;ve played that puts a fresh spin on Blink, Dishonored&#x27;s widely imitated short-range teleport spell. Admittedly, it&#x27;s less about the ability in itself, than how it works with and against the game’s sporadically coherent terrain. In Dishonored, Blink is sort of headshots but for movement, snapping you between points with toe-curling specificity. It takes the stodge out of vertical exploration and edits plodding stealth into a series of catlike pounces. It plays that role in Dream Cycle, too, especially when combined with levitation and silenced SMGs. But it&#x27;s also, here, a means of spelunking through a world that doesn’t quite want to be explored.

Need for Speed Heat was the 2019 entry to the series and the last to be developed by Ghost Games before being handed back to original developer Criterion.

Both Kits launch next month, starting with The Sims 4 First Fits Kit on 1st September. This one&#x27;s all about expanded child Sims&#x27; clothing options with a bunch of &#x27;fashionable and cute&#x27; outfits, some of which you can see in the header image above. 


&quot;Dress child Sims in trendy looks that are perfect for birthday parties, the classroom or just hanging out with friends,&quot; explains EA. &quot;Start your child Sims on a lifetime of trend-setting fashion and allow them to express themselves with the kinds of leopard-print jackets, patterned leggings and colorful shades they’ll want to wear when they grow up.&quot;

                              <span>A new suite of moves will be available to players in God of War Ragnarok.
This is according Game Informer which spoke with the game&#x27;s lead combat designers.
In the game, Triangle attacks have changed to Weapon Signature Moves that will have the Leviathan Axe or Blades of Chaos at your disposal. Kratos can infuse the weapons with either ice or fire - known as Frost Awaken and Whiplash. These elemental powers will help do extra damage to enemies by freezing them or putting them alight.

                              <span>You wouldn’t know it if you don’t read “Terrible Take Twitter” or the “Irate Internet,” but there’s been a lot of negativity around the remake of The Last of Us for PS5, subtly renamed to The Last of Us: Part 1. The gist of this anger is due to the original game on PS3 releasing a little over nine years ago. So, how dare Naughty Dog remake a game that new, right?
Frankly, I don’t care what projects a game development studio decides to take on, and in this particular instance the handwringing over an extensively spruced up remake feels rather performative. My take: this is a superb remake of an already brilliant game that brings it up to the standard people expect from a modern Naughty Dog game. It’s easily one of the best remakes I’ve ever played. 
If you are coming to The Last of Us for the first time, what you’ve got is essentially a zombie apocalypse scenario, but we don’t call them zombies – they&#x27;re the infected and they come in variety of horrific forms, such as Runners, Stalkers, and Clickers (the latter gives me shivers just reading the name). Joel, a bearded, gruff man, suffers a terrible loss when things take a dramatic turn, only for him to find Ellie, a teenage girl, in his care as they venture into  hostile lands on a delivery mission.

The show will debut on Netflix and all 10 episodes of the standalone series will premiere at the same time. Alongside the announcement of the official release date comes a trailer for the show and it rather &quot;bloody&quot; so it may not be safe for work.
The show tells the story of David Martinez, a street kid trying to survive in a technology and body modification-obsessed city.In the aftermath of a personal tragedy, he decides to take control of his destiny by becoming an edgerunner, a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.

                              <span>Credit where credit is due: Mojang has made some incredibly smart bets about ways to expand the Minecraft franchise. Back when Microsoft announced its purchase of the studio and its monolithic IP, I struggled to imagine exactly what could be done with Minecraft beyond the base game. Sure, that would continue to expand and grow – but did people really want to do anything else in that universe?

At the time, I reasoned that it didn’t matter if the universe could expand or not. Minecraft alone was big enough and important enough that it was worth every penny of the $2.5 billion Microsoft paid for it. But then, something magical happened: Mojang kept making smart partnerships that expanded the universe in brilliant and often unexpected ways.
Lego Minecraft went from a one-off set for nerds to a fully-fledged series of toys, beloved by children everywhere. Minecraft Story Mode released its first episode not long after the acquisition, and then 2019’s Minecraft Dungeons, which was a truly brilliant pairing of the established traditions of Minecraft with a kid-friendly Diablo clone. The Pokemon Go-like Minecraft Earth was a swing-and-a-miss – but that was an AR mobile game that launched right before a pandemic locked everybody indoors - so I’ll give them a pass.

                              <span>It looks as though September’s PS+ games may have been leaked, thanks to the usual sources over at Dealabs. According to leaker Billbil Kun, Need For Speed Heat, TOEM, and Granblue Fantasy Vs will be available to download for those who pay for a PlayStation + subscription.
Despite the previous leaks from Dealabs, take all this with a grain of salt. Leaks of this nature, regardless of prior accuracy, can always turn out false. So we recommend not getting too excited (or disappointed) by the games included.
The first title leaks for the September line up is Need For Speed Heat, allegedly available on PS4 consoles during the month. This is the latest entry into the legendary car racing series released back in 2019, and was released as a sort of celebration of the IPs 25th anniversary. We reviewed this game back in the day and gave it four stars out of five, concluding that “Need For Speed has remembered why people used to play it so religiously, and recognised the more recent elements that put them off.” A return to form for the series, well worth downloading.

                              <span>Without System Shock, we wouldn’t have Prey. We wouldn’t have BioShock. We wouldn’t have Dead Space – and, in fact, it’s Dead Space that’s the most notable in this list, because Visceral’s body-horror masterpiece was initially conceived as a System Shock sequel. System Shock, and its direct sequel, defined the horror genre and – to a degree – how we tell stories in games.  
But it’s likely a part of games history that’s lost on a lot of people. Games that came along later, were available on more platforms, and appealed more to a generation of game-players on Twitter and social media platforms, redefined survival horror. Ken Levine and his action/horror splice of genres in BioShock stole System Shock’s thunder, and morphed the entire genre into its own image. Visceral and Dead Space shunted the genre into the hands of Call of Duty players. Both helped usher the genre away from survival horror, and more towards action horror.

Glen Schofield gleefully watching on as one million Isaac Clarkes shot off countless alien limbs, Ken Levine purred as one million Booker DeWitts found one million lighthouses and predicted one million plot twists. Each of these games toyed with genre convention to deliver something markedly different from System Shock… yet neither of them would exist without Looking Glass Studios’ masterful debut.

                              <span>Wrath of the Lich King is nearly back in Classic World of Warcraft, thanks to the new expansion pre-patch released to the classic servers. This is big news for the old, the nostalgic, and the “back in my day” crowd, who’ll soon be able to venture back to the frozen wastes of Northrend to take down Arthas all over again. I’m sure you’ll get the mount you always wanted this time, bud.
Players can choose to either move onto this wave of new content with their pre-existing characters on Burning Crusade classic servers, or they can hop onto fresh servers to re-level a hero and experience the game with an economy that isn’t totally inflated and loads of guilds actually looking for new members.
Wrath of the Lich King is held in high regard in the minds of OG World of Warcraft players, with excellent raids and PvP content while also adding in some quality of life changes that really go a long way in convincing you not to ram your head into your desk — like duel specialisation, a dungeon finder, and more.

                              <span>Netease, the developer and publisher behind numerous titles including Naraka: Bladepoint and Diablo Immortal has announced the latest studio to be brought under their umbrella: Quantic Dream. This French developer is known for creating a range of narrative-focused titles including Heavy Rain, Detroit Become: Human, and Beyond Two Souls.
This marks the first European company to be acquired by Netease, as the company stretches its financial fingers across the world to pluck up studios left and right. With this particular acquisition, the folks at Netease state the studio will “continue to operate independently” as it develops titles across all platforms.
The studio will also apparently continue to support and publish third-party developed titles which is great news if you liked the look of Under the Waves — a game first revealed at Gamescom earlier this month which is published by Quantic Dream and developed by another French team at Parallel Studios.

                              <span>You might remember an article from Ubisoft from a couple of months ago that advised it would be decommissioning the online services for multiple games as of September 1.
Well, that time has come, and it&#x27;s one more day until these 15 Ubisoft titles go offline forever. In the grand world of video games, we&#x27;re well aware that nothing lasts forever; even though, really, we should be discussing video game preservation more often.
Today is the last day that online multiplayer will be available in any of the fifteen titles, but also the final day that you&#x27;ll be able to play any DLC you own - multiplayer or not. One example pointed out by a Reddit user is that those who bought the expansions for Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3&#x27;s 2012 release will no longer be able to access the DLC without buying the remaster of the game, and those with Splinter Cell Blacklist cosmetics will not be able to use them.

But while FromSoftware has not been bought by any big player, major companies are quickly buying up stock in Kadokawa, the corporation that owns FromSoftware.
Kadokawa announced this morning in a press release [PDF] that it has issued new shares of its stock in FromSoftware to Chinese giant Tencent, and Sony Interactive Entertainment.

                              <span>There are games that pit you against the elements in tough battles for survival, such as Rust, DayZ, and Valheim. Then there are games that take you on a grand sci-fi adventure with your friends, like Destiny and Outriders. But what if there was a game that let you do both? Enter Earth: Revival, an ambitious blend of survival gaming and shared-world shooting, that takes place on Earth following an alien invasion. We&#x27;ve taken Nuverse&#x27;s intriguing hybrid for a spin, and jotted down five reasons why you should be excited about Earth: Revival.

Earth: Revival&#x27;s takes place in the shadow of global catastrophe, with a setting that blends near-future sci-fi and post-apocalyptic storytelling. Set in 2112, Earth: Revival takes place on a ravaged and destroyed planet Earth, a result of an intergalactic conflict with a mysterious alien species. As Survivors of the war against the aliens, players will fight to reclaim Earth and restore what was lost.

The world of Earth: Revival is vast, diverse and dangerous. On their journey, players will explore numerous open environments, from a rid deserts to snow-filled valleys to dense, futuristic cityscapes. But don&#x27;t be fooled by what beauty Earth still retains. Its wildernesses are intensely hostile, with players contending against acid-rain, sandstorms and clouds of alien spores. Cities, meanwhile, are prowled by gangs and mercenary factions. To survive, you must gather resources and utilise 3D printing technology to create useful items and equipment, ranging from crucial survival gear to vehicles that help them traverse the world more easily. You&#x27;ll also need to manage your basic bodily needs, cooking food to maintain energy, purifying water to avoid becoming sick, and building cabins for shelter and as a base of operations.

Debian project funding
No any major updates on running projects.
Two 1, 2 projects are in the pipeline now.
Tryton project is in a review phase. Gradle projects is still fighting in work.
In July, we put aside 2389 EUR to fund Debian projects.
We’re looking forward to receive more projects from various Debian teams! Learn more about the rationale behind this initiative in this article.
Debian LTS contributors
In July, 14 contributors have been paid to work on Debian LTS, their reports are available:
Abhijith PA did 0.00h (out of 14.00h assigned, thus carrying over 14.00h to the next month).
Andreas Rönnquist did 0.00h (out of 0.00h assigned and 10.50h from previous period, thus carrying over 10.50h to the ne…</span>

                              <span>A notorious ex-DD decided
to post garbage on his site in which he links my name to the suicide of
Frans Pop, and mentions that
my GPG key is currently disabled in the Debian keyring, along with some
manufactured screenshots of the Debian NM site that allegedly show I&#x27;m
no longer a DD. I&#x27;m not going to link to the post -- he deserves to be
ridiculed, not given attention.
Just to set the record straight, however:
Frans Pop was my friend. I never treated him with anything but respect.
I do not know why he chose to take his own life, but I grieved for him
for a long time. It saddens me that Mr. Notorious believes it a good
idea to drag Frans&#x27; name through the mud like this, but then, one can
hardly expect anything else from him by this point.
Although his post is mostly garbage, there is one bit of information
that is correct, and that is that my GPG key is currently no longer in
the Debian keyring. Nothing sinister is going on here, however; the
simple fact of the matter is that I misplaced my OpenPGP key
card,
which means there is a (very very slight) chance that a malicious actor
(like, perhaps, Mr. Notorious) would get access to my GPG key and abuse
that to upload packages to Debian. Obviously we can&#x27;t have that --
certainly not from him -- so for that reason, I asked the Debian keyring
maintainers to please disable my key in the Debian keyring. 
I&#x27;ve ordered new cards; as soon as they arrive I&#x27;ll generate a new key
and perform the necessary steps to get my new key into the Debian
keyring again. Given that shipping key cards to South Africa takes a
while, this has taken longer than I would have initially hoped, but I&#x27;m
hoping at this point that by about halfway September this hurdle will
have been taken, meaning, I will be able to exercise my rights as a
Debian Developer again.
As for Mr. Notorious, one can only hope he will get the psychiatric help
he very obviously needs, sooner rather than later, because right now he
appears to be more like a goat yelling in the desert.
Ah well.</span>

                              <span>The Last Of Us Part I&#x27;s remake is heading to PlayStation 5 on September 2nd, which I assume is of modest interest if you want to play Joel and Ellie&#x27;s story over from the beginning with prettier graphics. It&#x27;s more interesting to us in PC land because it&#x27;ll be the first time the heart-and-zombie smasher makes its way to PC - albeit &quot;very soon&quot; after its console release.

Below, a new seven-minute clip of the remaster in action.

                              <span>Most &#x27;realistic graphics&#x27; mods make games look worse, but that&#x27;s not the case with NaturalVision Evolved. The long-in-development Grand Theft Auto 5 mod is a comprehensive revamp of lighting, textures, models and much more, but it remains faithful to the art direction of the base game. 

You can now download a Single Player Beta of the mod - and even if you don&#x27;t plan on doing that, it&#x27;s worth watching the trailer below.

The grand strategy sequel was finally announced last year, more than ten years after the release of Victoria 2, and now we have a release date as well: October 25th. What will people put in the comments underneath Paradox game trailers now? Hop below for the answer (and a release date trailer).

The 1TB model has also been discounted in the same sale, from £86 to £63, making it cheaper than many SATA SSDs of the same size.

                              <span>The thrill of a card game is in the hand you get dealt. Luck can either be on your side, or you can earn it back by using your wits, carving out a victory you never thought possible. Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn&#x27;t go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It&#x27;s a gripping mix that&#x27;s already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it&#x27;s a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

                              <span>While mooching around Samsung’s Gamescom booth, waiting for their 990 Pro SSD reveal, I took the opportunity to play with an altogether more unusual addition to their hardware catalogue. The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

                              <span>Back in February, Alice O. highlighted an expansion planned for Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla that’s reportedly being spun-off into a standalone stealth game. At the time the project was being referred to as Rift, but multiple sources are now saying the game will be called Assassin’s Creed: Mirage. Both Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb say they’ve been told by people familiar with the game that Mirage is accurate.

                              <span>Warner Bros’ licensed brawler MultiVersus won’t be getting support for local couch co-op anytime soon, game director Tony Huynh has said. Huynh was replying to a question on Twitter about whether the MultiVersus team were working on implementing that most Nineties of features. Speaking of Nineties nostalgia, you can watch a retro trailer for MultiVersus below. Makes me feel ten again.

                              <span>New World is getting its first major expansion in the form of Brimstone Sands, an arid endgame location for players to contest that comes bundled with a bunch of early game streamlining, and a brand-new weapon, too. I got hands-on with the expansion&#x27;s first hour or so and had a chat with the game&#x27;s creative director about it all. One year on, is it everything the game needs to satisfy long-time fans and attract newcomers? Yes! Well. Maybe...?

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to level with you: I&#x27;m not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I&#x27;m a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I&#x27;m unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I&#x27;m trying to learn new languages, though, so it&#x27;s not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you&#x27;re only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it&#x27;s better at playing the game than I am.

                              <span>Of all the games I saw at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, sci-fi team-based shooter Hyenas easily claims the title of &quot;Most Confusing Overall Experience&quot;. Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I&#x27;d eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.
I sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA&#x27;s stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game&#x27;s insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.

                              <span>AMD have, at long last, fully unveiled the Ryzen 7000 series of gaming CPUs – specs, pricing, the lot. There’s even a release date, September 27th, which will see AMD launch an initial salvo of four mid-to-high-end chips. These will aim to leapfrog Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors, several of which are among the best CPUs for gaming we’ve yet tried, with the aid of a new Zen 4 core design, DDR5/PCIe 5.0 support and some ambitious clock speed boosts.

                              <span>Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That&#x27;s a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?
In typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn&#x27;t easily spooled through. From one starting clip you&#x27;re able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.
Now. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!

Shovel Knight Dig, a collaboration between Yacht Club Games and UK studio Nitrome, feels like it&#x27;s been a long time coming, having first been revealed all the way back in 2019 - when Yacht Club explained it would take players deep into an &quot;ever-changing chasm of mystery&quot;.


More specifically, it&#x27;ll pit Shovel Knight against Drill Knight and his digging crew in a quest that&#x27;ll see adventurers jumping, slashing, and tunnelling their way downward through stages procedurally stitched together from &quot;thousands&quot; of level chunks in a bid to reach the bottom.

                              <span>Rocksmith+, the new subscription service version of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-running guitar learning series, finally has a release date and is coming to PC next Tuesday, 6th September.


Rocksmith+ was, you may recall, originally due to launch last summer, but Ubisoft made the decision to postpone its release based on player feedback during its closed beta, saying it wanted to &quot;ensure we provide the best guitar learning experience [and] deliver a smoother experience for all guitar and bass lovers&quot;.


Nearly twelve months later, Rocksmith+ is finally ready for release and will launch next week via the Ubisoft Store, promising a range of tools to help players hone their music skills. These include interactive lessons featuring Adaptive Difficulty - said to dynamically adjust to a player&#x27;s skill level while they play - and the Rocksmith+ Connect app for iOS and Android, which will take care of note detection and real-time feedback without the need for any peripherals.

                              <span>Victoria 3, the latest entry in Paradox Interactive&#x27;s long-dormant society builder series, finally has a release date and will be coming to PC and Xbox Game Pass for PC on 25th October.


Victoria, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar (which wouldn&#x27;t be all that surprising given that the previous game in the series released well over a decade ago), transports players back to the era of the Industrial Revolution for a take on Paradox&#x27;s beloved grand strategy genre that&#x27;s a little closer to a management game compared to the, say, RPG leanings of Crusader Kings.


Here, the focus is on building up the economic machinery of your state and country at the height of industrialisation - a process primarily achieved by tweaking and tinkering within your own borders, managing your people and fulfilling their needs to address political and societal challenges and deal with diplomacy further afield.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has shown off seven uncut minutes of The Last of Us Part 1 ahead of its launch on PlayStation 5 this week.


The video, below, shows the Bill&#x27;s Town section of the game. Joel, Ellie and Bill begin by stealthily taking down enemies before things go downhill. The gameplay ends with a Bloater fight in a gymnasium.


This video is one of our best looks yet at the scope of Naughty Dog&#x27;s high-profile remaster of its 2013 hit PlayStation 3 game.

                              <span>The first images of Logitech&#x27;s upcoming Nintendo Switch-like gaming handheld leaked last night - before getting forced offline.


As reported by The Verge, tech writer Evan Blass tweeted a trio of images showing off the device ahead of a planned reveal from Logitech.


The images were subsequently pulled offline following intervention from Logitech - but not before the internet noticed.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a theory going that Christopher Nolan is haunted by Stanley Kubrick - haunted but,  crucially, not possessed. Nolan&#x27;s hardly shunned the comparisons (and fair enough - few directors would). He naturally talked about 2001: A Space Odyssey during the promotional rounds for Interstellar, his sci-fi epic about humanity&#x27;s place in the universe. And about the way Hans Zimmer, his composer, borrowed moments of 2001&#x27;s Thus Spake Zarathustra and worked that into Interstellar&#x27;s score. 


But the reason he&#x27;s haunted by Kubrick, as opposed to possessed, is that while Nolan&#x27;s work has always channelled a bit of Kubrick&#x27;s, it&#x27;s never truly become it - never quite ascending to that plane. Nolan, since the still extraordinary Memento, has been a director who takes the themes, the scale, the technical marvel of directors like Kubrick and channelled these into making films that are repeatedly, often incomparably impressive. The problem, and the reason why it often feels like he&#x27;s carrying around this Kubrickian curse, is there is a difference between films that are impressive and films that are profound.


The temptation for me here is to look at Immortality, a game of demons, vice, and backwards talking, centred on mystery and murder, and say that just as Nolan is haunted by Kubrick, Sam Barlow, Immortality&#x27;s director and co-writer, is haunted by David Lynch.

                              <span>It looks like another new Pokémon from the forthcoming Scarlet and Violet is set to be revealed soon.


Yesterday a tweet from the official Pokémon account showed &quot;photographs&quot; from a Paldean photographer showing &quot;strange markings&quot;.


Today it&#x27;s confirmed these are from a new Pokémon called Grafaiai who&#x27;s &quot;quite difficult to catch in action&quot;.

Now it&#x27;s available to download in full and suggests, perhaps, the potential quality of GTA 6.

Now YouTuber j0nathan has released a new video detailing information on the game that&#x27;s been corroborated by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier.

                              <span>Some people appear to have played FIFA 23 a month before its official launch - and Ultimate Team player statistics are now flooding online.


FIFA 23 looks like it was playable for a brief period of time today on Xbox consoles after a pre-load went live to those who pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition. The EA Play trial may also have gone live early, allowing players access. FIFA 23 isn&#x27;t meant to go live until 27th September.


Surprisingly, some players were able to play the game, and even access Ultimate Team mode. One Twitch user, called mexico07dan1, even streamed FIFA 23 before suffering an account ban. However, clips of the stream, including the one below, remain online at the time of publication.

                              <span>Netflix has added a gamertag system to some of its games, with more social features apparently in the pipeline.
&quot;Game handles&quot;, a unique and public username, were first spotted in the Netflix app by Steve Moser (later reported by Tech Crunch).
The launch of this feature happened quietly last month and is currently only available for some of Netflix&#x27;s games, including Into the Breach, Mahjong Solitaire and Heads Up!. Only letters and numbers can be used in handles, which will be displayed publicly while playing instead of a profile icon and name.

                              <span>Sony has moved to reassure fans of its big budget single-player PlayStation games, as it announces a fresh PlayStation Studios Mobile Division.


Writing via the PlayStation blog, studios boss Hermen Hulst listed this year&#x27;s various PS4 and PS5 games - &quot;huge releases including Horizon Forbidden West, Gran Turismo 7, MLB The Show 22, and on November 9th, the highly anticipated God of War: Ragnarök&quot; - as well as PlayStation VR2, to demonstrate its commitment to console gaming.


At the same time, Hulst announced Sony was acquiring Savage Game Studios, a mobile game team based in Berlin and Helsinki, and folding it into the new PlayStation Studios Mobile Division, which will &quot;operate independently from our console development and focus on innovative, on-the-go experiences based on new and existing PlayStation IP&quot;.

                              <span>Warner Bros has filed a trademark for Big Chungus for use in video games, causing speculation (and hope!) that the supersized bunny is coming to MultiVersus.
The trademark, filed on 26th August with the European Union Intellectual Property Office, also covers a range of other things such as films, clothing, and toys. Whilst Big Chungus is perfect material for a soft toy, it seems more likely that he is being added to MultiVersus, given the game&#x27;s popularity and broad roster of fighters.

For those of you who aren&#x27;t aware of this absolute unit, let me explain.

                              <span>In not-all-that-surprising news, Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 has confirmed work is underway on a new Mafia title.


The confirmation came over the weekend from studio general manager Roman Hladík, in an interview celebrating 20 years of the series.


It was reported back in May this year that a fresh Mafia game was indeed in development at Hangar 13, and that it would apparently be set before the existing Mafia trilogy. This would place the game back in the prohibition era of the original - or perhaps earlier.

                              <span>Back in May of 2018, I remember briefly asking Junichi Masuda, then of Pokémon developer Game Freak (and now chief creative officer at the Pokémon Company), whether Pokémon might one day follow the likes of Zelda and Mario into some kind of open-world format. At the time he called it a &quot;possibility,&quot; if, and only if, the studio could find the right way to balance the traditional Pokémon staples with the open-world formula that was proving so successful elsewhere. It wasn&#x27;t until this January, a good four years later (a lifetime in Pokémon development terms), that we saw what that possibility really was in Pokémon Legends Arceus - an open-ish world game that was really more of a series of open areas, linked together but gated according to your progress, and that progress achieved by doing very traditional, classically Pokémon things.


Pokémon is of course barely relevant here, but that means of going sort-of-open-world might sound familiar to those with a close eye on Sonic Frontiers. It&#x27;s another knot in the thread, which we can now rather neatly tie from Breath of the Wild&#x27;s leap into the fully open world to Sonic, this coming November, doing the same in its own way. 


People do like to cut that thread, mind - or go further and suggest it doesn&#x27;t really exist. A common point made is that, while these games like to market themselves in the same way, finishing a trailer with a series mascot channelling a bit of Caspar David Friedrich by looking out imperiously over a green and mountainous world of adventure, that doesn&#x27;t mean the games are the same, or that one was inspired in an any meaningful way by the other. These games all have fundamentally different systems and different goals, after all, and so Breath of the Wild isn&#x27;t an influential game; it just had really influential box art.

                              <span>When Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, who’s well known for making courageous – and often unpopular – statements, claimed earlier this month that GTA 6 would set a new “creative benchmark for all entertainment,” many folks were quick to dismiss such claims as Take-Two and Rockstar Games’ hype machine derailing way too early. But what if he’s right?

The thought of Rockstar setting a new bar for interactive entertainment isn’t an alien concept. In fact, we’re still trying to figure out how the hell GTA Online keeps printing money at such an absurd rate in spite of years of complaints about a broken in-game economy and unbalanced updates. And maybe the answer is simply that Rockstar did in 2013 something that other triple-A developers are still struggling to figure out. It hasn’t been an easy evolution, but the UK-headquartered company has always been ahead of the curve.
To this day, we’re still talking about GTA 3 like the first proper 3D open-world game (sorry, Daggerfall). That’s canon now. Claude Speed’s hijinks in Liberty City set the stage for arguably the most famous structure used by modern action-adventure games. And while developers all over the world were trying to adjust to such a radical change, 2002 brought forth Vice City, which is a “magical place” for diehard fans – no matter when they first played it.

                              <span>The Gamescom 2022 showing for High On Life, the new Xbox-exclusive shooter from Squanch Games, has received a pretty mixed response online. Some people have found what’s been publicly showcased to be funny, but to others it’s a real nails-on-chalkboard situation. Having played the game at the show I can say one key thing, however: its humor lands a hell of a lot better in-context and in-game. 

To some extent, the humor is the whole point of this game. Squanch Games is a games studio founded by Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick and Morty and the voice behind the show’s titular characters. Roiland is trying to do what he does best, but in games – in-your-face adult humor, but delivered by colorful characters that, at first blush, might seem kid-friendly. They’re not.
The response to High on Life over the last week or so is intrinsically linked to these elements of the game. In fact, I’ve seen next to nobody talking about how it appears to play, or its colorful visuals, or the interesting suite of weapon types and abilities. People are more interested in the fact that the weapons talk, and most interested of all in what they’re saying.

                              <span>New World is receiving its first major content update with Brimstone Sands, which adds a new Egyptian-themed zone to the land of Aeternum as well as a new weapon and totally revamped new player experience. Set to launch in October following a stint in the Public Test Realm, the Amazon Games MMORPG hopes to lure players both new and old back.
The Brimstone Sands zone features Egyptian ruins built to honour god-like ancients present on the island many years ago, as well as Roman legionaries who travelled there to discover a way to revive the Roman Empire to its former glory. You’ll have to fight past them, plus sand demons and a variety of Egyptian foes to get your hands on new loot added in the update.
To help you power through all that nastiness, you can use the new Greatsword weapon. This uses both strength and dexterity, meaning it should fit snugly into builds featuring other martial weapons available. The weapon has both an offensive and defensive tree, allowing for both tanking and DPS capabilities.

                              <span>After the initial showing of Aliens: Dark Descent, you&#x27;ve probably got a lot of questions: is the game a sequel? Is Aliens: Dark Descent multiplayer? Can you play it only in single-player? When is this new Aliens game coming out? Well, after a hands-off session in Gamescom, Germany, we can at least help you out with the answers to a few of these burning questions.
First up, Aliens: Dark Descent is single-player only. The title is a squad-based, single-player action game that lands somewhere between Diablo and XCOM – at least to my eye. Playing through an original Alien story (set sometime after Alien 3, we&#x27;re told), you will command a squad of marines in real-time combat against the Xenomorph threat. You&#x27;ll need to think about troop placement, the terror levels of your crew, and how long your traps and tools can hold up before needing repairs.
The setup is this: there&#x27;s a prelaunch screen where you&#x27;ll have an overview of your crew before every deployment, and once you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ll be able to rifle through the various bits of detritus you&#x27;ve found to see if there&#x27;s anything particularly meaningful that you can salvage. Enter systems like item rarity, equipment slots, and such. But the actual meat of the game – the amount of time you&#x27;ll be exploring Moon Lethe with your (probably doomed) crew – that&#x27;s set at about &quot;anywhere 20 minutes and an hour&quot;.

                              <span>Devil May Cry, Bulletstorm, and God of War walk into a bar. They all sit, have a drink, and chat about revenge (or something). Suddenly, a gravel-voiced cowboy with pissed off eyes and a six-shooter in his hand kicks the saloon doors in. “This is my turf, lads,” he says, sounding like he’s been on 12 packs of cigs a day since he was five years old. “We don’t need Norsemen, space edgelords, or the son of a demon king in the Old West.”

And he’s right, you know? If any of these games went to the Western setting, they’d flounder and fail. Their tone just wouldn’t work: Devil May Cry’s trio of main characters most recently took up residence in definitely-not-London, and that modern setting meshed well with the series penchant descent into hell. Bulletstorm needed its uber-capitalist planet colony to contrast the anarchic chaos of its core cast. God of War… well, it’s a couple of millennia too early over at Sony Santa Monica, isn’t it?
So there’s a gap in the over-the-top action market in the frontier lands of the American West. And – fresh off the back of the excellent Shadow Warrior 3 and the artful Trek to Yomi – the folks at Flying Wild Hog are focusing on what they know best: fast, hard, bloody action. And it kicks ass (literally, and metaphorically).

                              <span>After Pokemon Legends Arceus and remakes of Diamond and Pearl, it feels strange that it’s only been three years since Pokemon Sword and Shield released, pre-pandemic, in November 2019. Back then, the only virus sweeping civilisation was the online eruption over the removal of the National Pokédex, or the bizarre concerns about Yamper’s ass wiggle. Despite the cynicism around its release, the first mainline Pokémon RPG on a home console carried expectations of catapulting the franchise’s competitive branch to new heights of popularity. 

As we’re all aware, that script was flipped in a way nobody anticipated. The Pokémon World Championships, originally scheduled to take place in London in 2020, were delayed two years in a row due to COVID-19, along with the respective tournament circuits. The Pokémon Company offered an admirable online replacement in the Pokémon Players Cup events, while corners of the Video Game Championship (VGC) community staged their own tournaments to fill the void. 

The changing VGC rulesets and the release of two expansions, Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra, maintained enthusiasm for Sword and Shield during lockdown. Online tournaments too meant a wider net of players could compete without travel expenses – like other esports during the pandemic. For a game pitched on stadium-sized battles and ballooning Pokémon through Dynamax, however, the big stage and in-person crowds felt like a key ingredient more so than any preceding Pokémon title in fulfilling its potential as a spectator event.

                              <span>Today, Warner Bros. Discovery and Rocksteady Studios have teamed up together to launch an inaugural Games Academy in the UK. This programme is focused on giving under-represented and eager game creators insight into the games industry, and offering formal training to up-and-coming developmental talent.
The programme is being launched in partnership with NextGen Skills Academy, who is &#x27;a leader in delivering skills-based vocational training for the creative industries.&#x27; Its aim is to help participants to build their confidence and to equip them with up-to-date technical skills that&#x27;ll aid with their careers in games. Ergo: it&#x27;ll help make the UK a destination for video game development talent.
The programme itself will run for 12 weeks, providing a hybrid training model that teaches participants about art, audio, quality assurance testing, and games design. Up to 20 selected participants will be able to partake in workships led by industry professionals, develop skills using software (such as Jira and Wwise), and use engines like Unreal. Those taking part will receive feedback and guidance on their work directly from the team at Rocksteady – the developer behind the Batman: Arkham Trilogy and the upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League – too!

As of this month, it&#x27;s been twenty years since the Mafia series made its debut with Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, and it&#x27;s certainly come a long way since. In commemoration, general manager Roman Hladík and head of production/media director Tomáš Hřebíček - who have worked on every game in the series - sat down, looked back on Mafia, and shared some dazzling new information with fans. They were also joined by another Hangar 13 game director, Alex Cox, who has been with them since the Mafia 2.
Towards the conclusion of the interview, the team were asked what&#x27;s next for the Mafia franchise, to which Roman Hladík responded, &quot;I&#x27;m happy to confirm we&#x27;ve started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it&#x27;s a few years away and we can&#x27;t share anything more right now, we&#x27;re really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.&quot;

                              <span>My turntable is temporarily out of action so this post is in lieu of a
crate digging update.
Some time ago, I saw Matt Hoye raving about a
little indie game called
Venineth. I think he said it was
the perfect little game to relax to. I don’t regularly play games but I could
sometimes do with some help relaxing. I was reminded about Venineth when I saw
some buzz about Exo One, a similar-looking game, so
I thought I’d give Venineth a go.


A scene near the start of Venineth
It’s great fun: Relaxing, mildly challenging, and satisfying. It didn’t run
terribly well on my T470s but I’ve since upgraded to a workstation which should
handle it easily so I need to try it again.
The reason this is a substitute for a crate digging post: although I’ve not
picked Venineth back up in a while, I have had the
soundtrack
on a reasonably heavy rotation. It’s an immersive, synth driven instrumental
album by polish musician Echo Ray that is good
music to listen to when concentrating.</span>

And, as I’ve been back in that same area for the past 15 years, I reflect some on the challenges that continue to play out.
Although the stories from the others were primarily about getting online, I want to start by setting some background.  Those of you that didn’t grow up in the same era as I did probably never realized that a typical business PC setup might cost $10,000 in today’s dollars, for instance.  So let me start with the background.
Nothing was easy

                              <span>DICE has shown off new gameplay footage of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s latest map: Stranded.


Set in the drained carcass of the Panama Canal, fitting the broader climate-apocalypse theme of the game, Stranded is a small-sized map with a focus on infantry combat. You can read more about the map and my initial impressions here.


You can also have look at how Breakthrough and Conquest 64 plays out on the map through gameplay captured during a hands-on session.

                              <span>If it&#x27;s a Netflix show released post-2018 or so, you can probably bet on it being cancelled, and that&#x27;s just what has happened to Resident Evil.
Another day, another headline that reads &#x27;Netflix cancels insert show you probably like here,&#x27; this time that particular show being Resident Evil. As reported by Deadline, Netflix has decided against renewing the show for a second season, only a month and a half after it was released on July 14.
As noted by Deadline, the show didn&#x27;t have a particularly strong showing in Netflix&#x27;s top 10, and points out that Netflix determines if it renews a show based on cost vs. viewing. But as always, how many people actually watched the show is a complete mystery, as Netflix, like essentially all streaming services, don&#x27;t release viewing numbers at all, not even giving them to showrunners.

                              <span>The TV adaptation of Twisted Metal has apparently wrapped up filming, and has moved onto post-production.
As spotted by VGC, Twisted Metal&#x27;s showrunner Michael Johnathon posted a tweet over the weekend noting that season one of the show had finished shooting. The show was greenlit back in 2021, and has writers from the Deadpool films attached as well.
&quot;The cast and crew of Twisted Metal was something special,&quot; wrote Johnathon in a tweet. &quot;Even with lightning delays, extreme heat, and cars that wouldn’t do as they’re told, everyone worked as hard as they could to make sure Twisted Metal kicked as much as possible.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 might not actually be out yet, but people are still already experiencing console and potentially Nintendo Switch Online bans from cheating.
In more recent years, Nintendo has been holding online tests for its multiplayer games, and it just did so over the weekend with Splatoon 3, giving everyone a first taste of the revamped Splatfests. The objectively correct Rock won the festivities, but it seems like some players were out for more than just splatting. As reported by Nintendo Life, and as spotted by dataminer OatmealDome, Nintendo has already banned players who are modifying the game.
It seems that the main reason players are experiencing bans is that they are accessing areas they aren&#x27;t meant to be able to yet, such as the testing range, by using patches that have been shared online. OatmealDome noted that players are receiving console bans if they&#x27;ve modified the game, and potentially even complete bans from using Nintendo Switch Online.

                              <span>PlayStation seems to be pushing towards the mobile market, as it sets up a dedicated mobile division, and acquires a mobile-focused studio.
Earlier today (August 29), PlayStation announced that it is acquiring mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. If you haven&#x27;t heard of it before, that might be because it hasn&#x27;t actually released a game yet, though its co-founders do include former Zynga, Rovio, and Insomniac staff, so there&#x27;s plenty of experience in the industry at the very least.
On top of that, PlayStation also announced that Savage Game Studios is joining the newly created PlayStation Studios Mobile Division, as sure a sign as any that the company wants to head into the mobile market. The newly created division &quot;will operate independently from our console development and focus on innovative, on-the-go experiences based on new and existing PlayStation IP,&quot; as described on the PlayStation Blog announcement post.

                              <span>I switched from blogger.com the Google Blog platform to the hosted wordpress.com of Automaticc, the WordPress blog engine main authors.
markdown formatting when writing blog entries, finally !
running on a opensource core, that I can move locally to my own server if I ever want to fiddle with MySQL and PHP.
I lose:
free CNAME redirect using my own domain name
a bit of advertising-free space. The blog at wordpress.com has a prominent header indicating I am using the free plan, but I am OK so far with that.
What stays the same:
Blogger and WordPress.com offer both tag-based RSS feed exports, so I decided to keep for  Debian Planet a feed containing only the posts related to free, libre and opensource software.
I was not ready to make the jump to a self hosted static blog generator, as I still wanted to have the possibility to comment, without me having to host the comment subsystem.
On the personal side, I also intend to pause twitter activity, as I notice current microblogging platforms tend to mostly contain flame wars, self promotion, or shared links I could find anyway with a good feed reader.</span>
