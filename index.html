May you ever grow in our hearts  
You were the grace that placed itself  
Where lives were torn apart  
You called out to our country  
And you whispered to those in pain  
Now you belong to heaven  
And the stars spell out your name 


As the news of Diana’s death forced itself into the homes of everyone in Great Britain, royalist tears flooding the carpets and dampening the underside of sofas, some people had other things on their minds.
It takes a lot to get a teenager out of bed on a Sunday morning, and if there’s no money involved it takes even more.

Wave 2 of the Booster Course Pass introduces two new cups with four new tracks each. The Turnip Cup includes tracks New York Minute (Tour), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalamari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS).
Meanwhile, the Propeller Cup includes Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and a brand-new map, Sky-High Sundae.

                              <span>If you consider yourself a fan of fantasy, specifically the kind of fantasy written by working class British people who have sadly left this world in a boat drifting towards the sunset, then this new Lord of the Rings Unreal Engine 5 concept trailer might be right up your alley.
Created as a montage of fan-made Unreal Engine 5 projects setexplicitly in Tolkien’s legendary world of orcs, elves, and hobbits, we’re taken around to a variety of famous and recognisable vistas from the story we know and love. This includes a vibrant shower, the doors to Moria, and of course the Tower of Mordor.
Now, we’ve actually highlighted one of these montage concept trailers before. YouTube channel Enfant Terrible often create videos with a similar format and previously took us to the world of Bloodborne, recreated in UE5. It goes a long way in getting your imagination going, if nothing else. Also, it’s always great to see community creatives go ham with the relatively new engine, especially in universes we love.

                              <span>The Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 Max has a rather cumbersome name, but a lot of that comes from this headset’s pedigree, an upgrade to a second-generation wireless headset that’s one of the best in its class. It’s more expensive, but also outright better - and it’s one of my favorite gaming headsets on the market right now. 


In terms of its core feature set, this new Max model is largely similar to the original Stealth 700 Gen 2. It builds on several years and other models of Turtle Beach headset, and as a result it’s pretty damn sharp in all the metrics that matter.


It’s comfortable and can be worn for hours, for instance. It feels about as sturdy as a lightweight, wireless headset can be, and seems built to withstand the standard-issue wear and tear that’ll come from putting it on, hurriedly ripping it off, and tossing it to one side of the sofa - though I obviously wouldn’t exactly want to sit on it.

As well as that, anyone who finds themselves having fun across the Caribbean-inspired state of Yara will also be able to pick up the game with up to 60% off. This promotion will be available until August 17, and should you choose to buy the game, all of your progress from the free weekend will be carried over.
Players can install the game on consoles, or via Epic, Stadia, and Ubisoft Connect now, with access being revoked on 8 August at 7pm BST / 2pm ET / 11am PT.

Blizzard exec Jon Spector tweeted the news last night, in response to questions from fans on whether another test period would take place.


&quot;While we will continue testing OW2 daily internally, we&#x27;re not planning any additional public beta tests,&quot; Spector wrote. &quot;With all the valuable feedback we received from our alpha and two public beta tests, we will be focusing our efforts on launching the best game possible on 4th Oct.&quot;

Speaking to Rock, Paper, Shotgun, senior narrative designer Philip Lawrence said the decision to launch last year&#x27;s entry True Colors as a complete experience was &quot;the right decision&quot;, and one the studio wanted to stick with.


&quot;I can&#x27;t imagine we&#x27;d go back to the episodic model,&quot; Lawrence said. &quot;The reaction has been very positive.&quot;

The latest example of this sees Joel on horseback, as the screen slides between the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same scene.


&quot;Get ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful - and dangerous - journey across America in The Last of Us Part 1,&quot; Naughty Dog proclaimed in its tweet with the footage, which you can see below.

However, some fans are unhappy with both graphical changes and the cost of the remake.


The pixel art of the original has been smoothed out which gives a rounded effect, while the text has been sharpened with a new font.

Dataminer AndyReloads has already filmed himself strutting around like Iron Man in a new suit of armour that lets you wield a chest laser akin to Stark&#x27;s own arc reactor. 


The design of the armour, and especially the colouring, are obviously Iron Man-themed. But - thankfully - you&#x27;re not actually Iron Man, and the rest of the design bears resemblence to those warn by the series&#x27; technological Isu race.

The sale of Square Enix&#x27;s western studios - notably Crystal Dynamics and Eidos - was &quot;driven by concerns that the titles cannibalised sales of the rest of the group&quot;, with the company aiming to improve capital efficiency.

                              <span>We&#x27;re still not quite at the 1.0 release for Vampire Survivors, but we are at least now one step closer.


Following on from the recent release of patch 0.9, developer Poncle has now released patch 0.10.0 for the game, or in its words, &quot;The Not One&quot; patch. You can see a teaser for it below.


This patch brings with it a host of new content, such as new characters Cosmo Pavone and Big Trousers. Players will also now be able to get two new achievements, a new Arcana and a new weapon.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 remains the darling of Square Enix&#x27;s output as the publisher announces declining financial results in its latest report.



Total net sales from the last financial quarter (April to June) were 74.8bn yen, a drop of almost 16 percent compared to the same period last year, while operating income was 14.4bn yen, a drop of almost 17 percent. Net income actually rose due to foreign exchange gains.


However, while net sales of HD games has declined year on year, sales of MMO games have conversely risen year on year.

First announced in March, the concert will be held at Tokyo Garden Theatre on 11th August at 6pm local time in Japan.


For UK fans that&#x27;s 10am, and you&#x27;ll be able to stream it via YouTube and start your Thursday off with some Grammy-worthy tunes.

Even better - for those of us who like peeking inside our Christmas presents a little early - these files line up with a previous leak which appeared to identify the specific platforms for each upcoming DLC course. 


Now, fans have put together what they think is a schedule for the remaining DLC cups, including all of the tracks from Wave 3, expected later this year.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to March and you might recall reports claiming Microsoft was working on a new family plan for Game Pass. Those reports, it now transpires, were true, and an Insider Preview test of the new scheme is available now in an extremely limited number of countries.


As detailed in a new Microsoft blog post, the Xbox Insider trial version of the scheme will enable anyone with a special Insider Preview Game Pass plan to invite up to four people to share that subscription, with each one then gaining unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&#x27;s full selection of games, content, and benefits.


The immediate catch right now is that the test is only available to those in Colombia and Ireland. And while the people being added to a subscription by Insiders don&#x27;t need to be an Insider themselves, they do need a Microsoft account and must be in the same country.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s announcement that Frogwares - the developer behind the likes of Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One and The Sinking City - is remaking its 2007 Sherlock/Lovecraft crossover The Awakened, the studio has released a first cinematic trailer for the project, which is seeking Kickstarter funding right now.


The Awakened, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was the third instalment in a series of Frogwares-developed Sherlock Holmes investigatory adventures that has so far spanned nine games, pitting the Baker Street detective against Cthulhu cults and eldritch abominations across Victorian London, Switzerland, New Orleans, and the Scottish Highlands.


Frogwares&#x27; remake will see the studio reimagining the title for modern audiences, drawing on its learning from the more recent Sherlock games, and retooling its story to be a continuation of the young Sherlock arc, which started in last year&#x27;s Chapter One. And if you&#x27;re curious to know how that might look, the developer has you covered with a new cinematic trailer in which Sherlock and Watson traverse the New Orleans bayous into a strange realm  that, pleasingly, looks to share more than a few aesthetic beats with Frogwares&#x27; Lovecraftian The Sinking City.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds.

                              <span>A few years ago I had to be on very strong painkillers to help me sleep, and while I didn&#x27;t have more nightmares than usual, the quality of the ones I did have was markedly more weird than what I was used to. Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer. If Stanley Tucci visited this town on his quest to eat nice ravioli, his final piece to camera would be from inside an imminently-afire wicker effigy.

                              <span>Crypt of the Necrodancer, the acclaimed rhythm-based dungeon-crawler from Brace Yourself Games, has - following its first update in five years last month - launched a huge new expansion, titled Synchrony, into Steam early access, bringing new characters, online multiplayer, and more. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, there&#x27;s also some sort of sequel or spin-off on the way.


Getting the latter part of the announcement out of the way first, as details are currently rather limited, the follow-up is called Rift of the Necrodancer and is described as &quot;new standalone rhythm game in the Necrodancer universe.&quot; Exactly what form it&#x27;ll take is currently unclear, but Brace Yourself says to &quot;stay tuned&quot; for more details.


Thankfully, if it&#x27;s details you want, Crypt of the Necrodancer&#x27;s newly released Synchrony DLC delivers in spades, arriving alongside an absolutely enormous set of release notes. To summarise though, it brings three new characters, new enemies, new items, online multiplayer, a new Versus mode, full mod support, plus a stack of DLC-exclusive features.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the ever-expanding rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, continues to swell, this time with the newly released Enter the Panchaku update, which introduces pet petting, a formidable dual frying pan weapon, and more.


The ability to pet your pets in a rogue-like action-platformer mightn&#x27;t be at the top of your own personal list of exciting additions, but - as revealed in Evil Empire&#x27;s extremely extensive release notes - the feature is now in, giving players the ability to show their companions some love between biomes. And why wouldn&#x27;t you want to do that, you monster?


Elsewhere, the free Panchaku update introduces the new Panchaku weapon, which keen-eyed players might recognise as originating in the animated trailer for Dead Cells&#x27; Bad Seed expansion. It&#x27;s described as &quot;two frying pans tied together with a piece of string, which crits on enemies facing you and has a slick combo with hits behind and all around you&quot;. It&#x27;ll also reflect bombs and projectiles mid-combo.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re talking Pokémon, following the franchise&#x27;s huge announcement livestream that divulged fresh details on upcoming games Scarlet and Violet. 


The star of that show? Well, obviously it was Fidough - a freshly-baked dog  Pokémon made of bread, whose popularity has now set the internet ablaze. But, dear viewer, we have questions. If Fidough is bread... can you eat it? Should you eat it? Why wouldn&#x27;t you eat it? And how does it evolve?

                              <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 14th season coming in fast and its pre-launch promotional push in full swing,developer Respawn Entertainment has shared further details on new hero Vantage - this time focusing on her abilities - ahead of her arrival next Tuesday, 9th August.


Vantage was officially unveiled as Apex Legends&#x27; 22nd hero at the end of July, in a new Stories from the Outlands video introducing her as a young hunter on the snowy planet of Págos. Adding a sport of drama to her backstory, her mother is an escaped prisoner (wrongly convicted) who was forced to turn herself in after Vantage was badly injured in an accident.


With that lore dump out the way, Respawn has now turned its attention to detailing what Vantage will bring to Apex Legends in gameplay terms, revealing her abilities to be based around two core elements: her sniper rifle and her bat-like companion Echo.

That&#x27;s right, Wii classic Coconut Mall has been fixed, so the Shy Guy-driven cars at the end of the course are no longer static.


Bizarrely, however, rather than just move back and forth as they did in the Wii original, the vehicles now pull off doughnuts. I&#x27;m not sure this was an improvement.

Levels for The Spy Who Loved Me 64 include The Alps, where Bond famously skied off the side of a cliff only to deploy a Union Jack parachute, much to the chagrin of his perusers.

                              <span>The internet went barking mad over all the new information revealed in yesterday&#x27;s Pokémon livestream, but in particular the new breed Fidough, who yesterday became one of main topics of discussion on the internet. 


I&#x27;ve been asked (read, allowed) to bring you the best freshly-baked Fidough content that we&#x27;ve been enjoying. Consider this as a bit like a Paul Sudowoodo handshake.


Right. Let&#x27;s get this bread.

                              <span>Someone once wrote - I can&#x27;t find the piece, of course - that the reason Peanuts is better, and also weirder and sadder, than other gag comic strips is that it has four panels rather than three. Most comic strips find that three is enough, and why wouldn&#x27;t it be enough? Setup, development, punchline. The fourth panel in Peanuts is where things get weird and sad. A moment after the joke. A human moment, awkward and brilliant and often deeply memorable.


Anyway, I thought of this yesterday when pondering why most XCOM-alike tactics games have two action points, while Hard West 2 has three. 


Let&#x27;s take it back to the start: Jake Solomon&#x27;s XCOM reboot Enemy Unknown hit on something very special when it reduced the complexity of a turn-based tactics game down to a simple idea: each unit can do two things per turn. You can move and shoot, or you can move twice, etc etc. It&#x27;s not really a reduction in complexity, actually, but a clever repositioning of complexity. By making the rules of the game clear and non-fiddly, it allowed players to understand that the really engaging decisions lay out there on the actual battlefield. It wasn&#x27;t how to move and shoot, it was what you might do through moving and shooting.

Either way, Google, ever desperate to prove Stadia is still alive and kicking, is offering new LG TV owners a free three-month subscription to Stadia Pro. 


The Stadia app launched last year on LG TVs and supports any model from 2020 onwards.

                              <span>Long ago, I was a muso. At school I was the kid who never had a lunchtime or afterschool spare between choirs, orchestras, and jazz bands. At university I spent as much time with the musical theatre society as I did studying for my actual music degree. And with Two Point Campus, this gives me one ultimate objective: to create the ultimate fantasy music school.


Before that though, the basics. To those who&#x27;ve played spiritual predecessor Two Point Hospital, Two Point Campus will be very familiar. The two games are near-identical in their approach: take something typically mundane and make a game of it, adding a healthy dose of oddball British humour. The controls are reassuringly familiar, the art style bright, detailed and easily readable, and university life is accompanied by an appropriately 80s soundtrack for all the gossipy, John Hughes drama.


The game&#x27;s campaign is essentially an extended tutorial, each new level providing fresh challenges to explain core mechanics and systems, and serving as preparation for the endless customisable sandbox mode. Each campus begins as a blank slate of buildings ready to be filled with lecture halls, classrooms, dormitories, bathrooms, private tuition rooms, libraries, and more. Staff need to be hired to teach, clean up, and keep students happy. Students have their own needs which pop up in the form of mission requests: I need a party! I need a bookcase to study! I need a love bench! (More on that later).

A tweet from a Bungie employee in June listed a collaboration with African-American streamer Uhmaayyze, who the employee described as a hero.


The tweet received death threats in response, which was followed by several Bungie employees receiving calls, texts, and voicemails from anonymous callers on their personal phones filled with racial slurs, reports The Record.

The nature of the DLC means that players will need to complete the base game before it&#x27;s accessible to them.

Tencent already owns around five percent of Ubisoft (alongside chunks of dozens of other video game companies). Now, it&#x27;s seeking more.

                              <span>A Twitch streamer has achieved the impossible by completing the $20,000 (£16,400) Halo 2 challenge.


The challenge, set earlier this year by streamer Charlie &quot;Cr1tikal&quot; White, was that someone had to complete the entirety of the Halo 2 Anniversary campaign without dying on Legendary difficulty, with all &quot;Skull&quot; modifiers on. 


The effect of the modifiers range from increasing the health of enemies to all enemies being permanently cloaked. The only modifier that must be kept off is &quot;Envy&quot; skull, which replaces Master Chief&#x27;s torch with an active camouflage system (because that would make things too easy).

Earlier this year, Jeff Grubb reported that a Black Panther game was in the works with EA. Now, the loose-lipped journalist has shared that another Marvel project is also underway with the company.


Chatting as part of Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings stream, Grubb stated: &quot;[EA is] making that Black Panther game we spoke about... and [it&#x27;s] making another Marvel game that&#x27;s single player&quot;. This comment was said in a rather throw away manner, but, of course, it was quickly picked up by the internet.

That&#x27;s according to a new Nikkei (paywall) report, which follows up on Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial results issued earlier this week. 


During those results, Nintendo said it faced manufacturing issues due to component shortages. Speaking to Nikkei, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that sorting these was now Nintendo&#x27;s immediate goal.

                              <span>Have you ever met a cheater in Red Dead Online? I have - a few times, in fact. The latest encounter came at the worst possible moment, after I had spent an hour painstakingly hunting animals to fill up my wagon with pelts. I had set off on a trader mission across the map, opting for a risky long-haul voyage that left me open to attack.
A potential shootout with a player was a risk I could accept: combating an invisible god-like assailant, however, was something I really hadn&#x27;t signed up for. Out of nowhere, I was transformed into a flying saucer. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to realise what was happening - Red Dead Online is notorious for its cheaters, and one of them had decided to spend their evening targeting me. 


It turns out that driving a wagon as a spaceship is quite difficult. The ship was so vast that it obscured my view, and the glow from its lights made navigating the pitch-black desert almost impossible. Using my mini-map to steer, I somehow made my way to my destination, but my ordeal wasn&#x27;t over quite yet. I had some bandits to deal with.

                              <span>For those who&#x27;ve been with Sea of Thieves since its release back in 2018, the captaincy update is a thing of legend; originally intended to be the multiplayer pirate adventure&#x27;s very first post-launch update, it would give players the opportunity to acquire their own persistent vessel on the seas, and - in a proposition that still excites the pirate in me to this day - start their sessions in a gloriously dramatic fashion, bursting through the Legendary Hideout&#x27;s massive waterfall out into the world. But then Sea of Thieves&#x27; slightly wobbly launch happened, and Rare shifted its focus to fleshing out the game&#x27;s sandbox following criticism of its limited core. With that, the captaincy update was set aside, but never quite forgotten by the player base, gradually becoming the stuff of legend with the passing of time.


But then, earlier this year, it returned. As announced during Microsoft&#x27;s June showcase, captaincy and boat ownership were, after all this time, back on the cards. Now, the wait is finally over, with Sea of Thieves&#x27; near-five-years-in-the-making captaincy update launching later today.

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

Seemingly not, if publisher Koch Media are any indication, as they announced today that they&#x27;ve changed their name to Plaion. At least the mispronunciations are now lower stakes.

One of the included bug fixes is that &quot;The &#x27;Ask to be Girlfriend/Boyfriend&#x27; Want now targets appropriate Sims&quot;, which sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of my favourite monitors, and I picked one up from Amazon the last time it was discounted. This week the 32-in model has been discounted to a similar price, so I thought I should let you all know about it!

This is the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for this model, actually, even lower than it was during Prime Day, so it&#x27;s well worth picking this up if you&#x27;re after a high-speed drive for your PC or PS5.

                              <span>Intel’s Arc Alchemist graphics cards – their first real go at dedicated desktop gaming GPUs in modern times – are in a bit of a weird spot. If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

The newie is Turbo Golf Racing, which looks like Rocket League for minigolf and is hitting Game Pass on the very day it launches. Shenzhen is absolutely worth a go if you enjoy Zachlike puzzlers, and Turbo Golf looks like one of those &quot;could be fun, sure I&#x27;ll give it a try&quot; Game Pass games.

                              <span>Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but &#x27;round these parts we refer to it as &quot;The Laughing Deer Show&quot;. New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as &quot;barely contained&quot;. Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger&#x27;s action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol&#x27; stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character&#x27;s action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can&#x27;t be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question &quot;what games would you play for the first time again?&quot; more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

                              <span>Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you&#x27;re a manager with a budget and you&#x27;ve got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you&#x27;re not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you&#x27;re in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you&#x27;re able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that&#x27;s uniquely yours.

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

While just a few days into the Linux 6.0 merge window, here are some early benchmarks showing some of the areas where Linux 6.0 is allowing higher performance out of existing AMD EPYC 7003 series hardware...</span>

You read that right. Whiskey. Not the usual energy drink with videogame branding.
That said, you can mix the two readily and it doesn&#x27;t taste too awful. Trust me.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developers Behaviour Interactive have announced Meet Your Maker, a first-person building-and-raiding game.
Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the game has you building stand-alone levels called Outposts. The goal is not only to protect your Outpost but to infiltrate those created by other players.
Building focuses on a strategic, block-based design where you will draw from a customizable toolbox. Here you will find traps and guards for your maze-like Outpost. There are also Raiders ready for combat and posed to enter and attempt to take over other players’ creations.

                              <span>Chinese conglomerate Tencent has plans to acquire more shares in Ubisoft, according to sources familiar with the matter.
A reported by Reuters, the firm has expressed interest in increasing its stake in the game maker. Back in 2018, it acquired a 5% stake in Ubisoft, and as of press time, it&#x27;s unclear how much more of a stake Tencent plans to purchase, but it wants to become the single largest shareholder.
Currently valued at $5.3 billion, the Guillemot family, who founded Ubisoft, owns 15.9% of company shares and 22.3% of the net voting shares. It&#x27;s said Tencent could offer up to $101.84 per share to gain additional stakes - a premium of 127% to the stock&#x27;s $44.81 average price over the past three months.

                              <span>MultiVersus season one has been delayed to at least August 15, being pushed back for just over a week from the original seasonal start date. Originally, this was due to go live on August 8, but due to these unforeseen delays announced via social media, players will have to wait a little while longer to progress through a new battle pass.
In addition, this means Morty is also being delayed to a yet-to-be-announced time in the future. The extended season time can be either good or bad depending on your progress through it, but the push back of the second DLC character is a rough blow to pretty much everyone.
Game director Tony Huynh seems to be taking the development hard, tweeting from their personal account “I’m very unhappy that we disappointed players”. Now, delays do happen, especially in games that are receiving new content at a fast pace like MultiVersus, so it’s reasonable to expect bumps in the road every now and again.

                              <span>Today is a good day for fans of last year&#x27;s GOTY contender The Ascent, the top-down shooter from Neon Giant. The game has made huge strides since its release last summer. 
Most notably, The Ascent arrived on PlayStation, and received various bits of smaller add-ons. But no meaningful new content made it into the game since then, and this is about to change.
Neon Giant today revealed Cyber Heist, a major new DLC for The Ascent. The add-on arrives August 18, priced $10/€10/£8. Cyber Heist adds new main and side mission chains, set in a new Malhorst-Gelb-owned arcology. The story takes place after the events of the main campaign, with Kira offering you a new job.

It was revealed that the developer has plenty of plans up its sleeve, including two new games in the works, but of course, Albert Wesker stole the show.
Dead by Daylight was in receipt of its first Resident Evil chapter in summer of last year. The introduction of fan favourites, Nemesis, Leon Kennedy, and Jill Valentine, saw the game reach its highest player count yet on Steam.
Obviously having realised exactly what fans are eager for, Behaviour Interactive announced a second Resident Evil chapter during its sixth-anniversary stream in May, 2022.

                              <span>If you have spent any amount of time with The Sims 4, or even appreciating one of the communities many content creators, you&#x27;ll know that the simulation title can be chaotic. Half the charm of The Sims 4 is undoubtedly wedding the weirdest of couples and ultimately finding unique ways to kill them off, but the latest bugs to plague players have taken this to an unprecedented level of strange.
Following last weeks&#x27; free update to The Sims 4, which now allows players to choose the sexual orientation of their sims, a couple of unusual bugs emerged as a result.
The first of the bugs to emerge saw sims rapidly aging in a matter of minutes. For those who hate to look after toddlers, this wasn&#x27;t a terrible thing, but seeing entire families turn into seniors was frustrating for many.

                              <span>It seems part of the plan at this point, but a few things from the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 have leaked thanks to a private event with NFL players. 
Activision invited the Los Angeles Rams to play an early version of the multiplayer shooter this week, resulting in a few of the players showing content that&#x27;s yet to be officially announced, before they deleted their tweets, replacing them with generic shots of event banners.
Nothing can ever be truly gone from the internet, however, so Call of Duty fans anxious for some new information about Modern Warfare 2 saved and analysed the images for all for all of us. The first one of these is a fairly benign shot of the game&#x27;s lobby, which shows a similar layout to the more recent Call of Duty games.

                              <span>Welcome to the July 2022 report from the Reproducible Builds project!
In our reports we attempt to outline the most relevant things that have been going on in the past month. As a brief introduction, the reproducible builds effort is concerned with ensuring no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised. As ever, if you are interested in contributing to the project, please visit our Contribute page on our website.

                              <span>Munnar is a hill station in Idukki district of Kerala, India. Home to 
2nd largest tea plantation in the country. Lot of people 
visit here on summer and in winter as well. I live in the neighboring district of Munnar though I never made a visit. In my mind I pictured Munnar as a Tourist trap 
with lots of garbage lying around.
I recently made a visit and it changed my perception of this place.

Little background
I never liked tea much. I am also not a coffee person either. But if I 
have to choose over two that will be coffee because of the strong aroma. 
Going to relatives house, they always offered hot tea defacto. I 
always find difficult say ‘no’ to their friendly gesture. But I hate 
tea.
A generation before me drinks lot of tea here at my place. You can see 
tea stalls in every corn…</span>

                              <span>With NBA 2K23&#x27;s 9th September release date rapidly approaching, publisher 2K has shared a closer look at this latest series instalment&#x27;s new features - including a new trailer - playing up the concept of &quot;authenticity&quot; across its defensive and offensive tool kit.


It&#x27;s an extensive list of new features, as detailed in a lengthy new blog post, with 2K saying this year&#x27;s gameplay changes should &quot;should translate to more wins, and more seamless actions&quot;.


On the offensive side of things, there are new gesture combos to the Pro Stick, which 2K says has allowed it to &quot;expand the dunking controls to let you dunk exactly how you want&quot;. That includes the addition of a new rim hang control which, on new gen consoles, incorporates physics-based simulated rim hangs.

This was the company&#x27;s first ever showcase, streamed live on Twitch and YouTube. 

Here&#x27;s everything that was shown.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has revealed its next game: Meet Your Maker.


It&#x27;s a first-person building and raiding game that takes place in a hellish, post-apocalyptic wasteland, with players building towering industrial outposts filled with traps to protect genetic material - and then infiltrating the outposts of others to steal the precious resource.


It certainly feels like a departure from the popular horror multiplayer game, both in its genre and its aesthetic. But there are more similarities than you might think.

Halfbrick - also the studio responsible for mobile classic Fruit Ninja - initially announced an iOS and Android sequel to Jetpack Joyride back in February 2021, with an accompanying trailer suggesting some very familiar action, albeit with a slightly slicker new HD art style.


That announcement was accompanied by a limited launch in select territories, but Halfbrick suddenly pulled the game from Google Play and the iOS App Store in March this year, saying it had &quot;entered a new closed phase of development for an indefinite period&quot;.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Pokémon livestream, gave us a look at the exclusive plushies that&#x27;ll be sold at London&#x27;s upcoming Pokémon Center.
The Pokémon Company had already announced the Pokémon Centre pop-up store will be returning to London, but hadn&#x27;t given away any details on what new Pikachu design will be appearing. Images of the plushies have now been released, via today&#x27;s Pokémon livestream.
The previous pop-up store in 2018 had Pikachu suited up and topped off with a bowler hat, and was so popular the store ended up having to limit purchases and opening hours in order to cope with demand. This time, Pikachu has an even more iconic London look.

                              <span>It is impossible to get your head around memory. It&#x27;s intangible, yet all-powerful. It can be like living with a ghost, but the ghost is Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
If I was making a game about my own memories, my own experience of interacting with memory, I am confident that it would be the worst game ever made. An open-world affair, but an endlessly glitchy one. Landmarks disappear and shift. The same journey can take hours one day and seconds the next, and when you reach the destination it&#x27;s entirely different anyway. And wherever you go, you&#x27;re always at the centre of the map. I do not want to play this game.
But what about a game exploring someone else&#x27;s memories? What form would that take? What problems might it run into? Hindsight is an attempt to answer the first question, I think, and it also provides plenty of answers to the second.

                              <span>New data reveals that most mobile gaming genres have seen a decline in revenue during the first half of this year. 
The data from reliable app store analysis firm SensorTower stated the mobile gaming market fell by 9.6 percent year-over-year to $11.4bn in the US.
The only two categories that did not see a decline in the mobile gaming market were tabletop and arcade games.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard and Chinese publisher NetEase have reportedly cancelled an unannounced World of Warcraft MMO following a disagreement between the two parties.


As reported by Bloomberg, the unannounced project - internally known as Neptune and in development for three years - wasn&#x27;t a direct adaptation of the existing WoW MMO, but rather an MMORPG spin-off set in the same universe but during a different time period.


However, despite the project&#x27;s already lengthy development period, NetEase is now said to have disbanded its creative team - consisting of more than 100 developers - after a disagreement with Activision Blizzard &quot;over financial terms&quot; resulted in both parties pulling the plug.

But alas, the Stray modding community continues to give, and I am therefore compelled to continue cataloguing their work (see, that one wasn&#x27;t even noticeable! That wasn&#x27;t painful now, was it?).


First up, there&#x27;s another mod for the dog lovers among us, thanks to MrMarco1003, this time with Bolt from the titular Disney movie. The mod also changes Stray&#x27;s meows into barks, and you&#x27;ll get to see Bolt chilling out with his identically-shaped fur-iends at the beginning of the game. 


With the dog lovers placated, let&#x27;s move onto the modifications for us cat lovers.

&quot;What if Sonic Triple Trouble had been originally released on the Sega Genesis / MegaDrive, after Sonic 3 and Knuckles,&quot; asked fan game developer Noah Copeland. Well, Copeland not only asked this question, but they also answered it.
After releasing a demo for their creation several years ago, yesterday saw Copeland&#x27;s passion project fully realised (thanks, The Deleter).

                              <span>On May 7th 2020, Microsoft kicked off the new generation of consoles with a gameplay showcase featuring a wide range of games planned for the Xbox Series X - and Bright Memory: Infinite was the very first game shown off during this presentation. Now, more than two years later - and half a year after the arrival of the PC version - Bright Memory: Infinite has arrived on console. Given its prominent placement in that original showcase, I felt that we needed to check it out here on Digital Foundry. On the face of it, this is indeed a &#x27;next-gen only&#x27; exclusive - you can&#x27;t play the game on PS4 or Xbox One consoles - which makes the launch of a Nintendo Switch version all the more intriguing.


Bright Memory: Infinite is a fast-paced first-person shooter which combines snappy gunplay with sword driven melee combat. It&#x27;s not a long game but what&#x27;s here is solid and reasonably well executed - it almost recalls the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior, though with more focused, linear level design. Plus, if you&#x27;re playing on the latest consoles, Bright Memory Infinite promises support for 120Hz output and ray traced reflections, though not simultaneously.


Where it surprises the most, perhaps, is in its development history. Bright Memory: Infinite is a showpiece title for what modern development tools can offer when in the right hands - you see, most of the development duties on the game were executed by one person. In creating the game, Infinite was built using Unreal Engine 4 with additional support software and Quixel assets to speed up development time. That&#x27;s not to say this is entirely a solo project - artists, musicians and voice actors were all required to complete the game but considering the quality of the presentation, it&#x27;s an impressive accomplishment.

                              <span>Over the weekend, a leak with potential details of the next Tomb Raider game made its way around the internet. These details came from an audition script for a role in the game, and told of Lara Croft leading a team of younger tomb raiders as she deals with the isolation of success. 


Now, Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has issued a DMCA takedown notice to the Sacred Symbols Patreon, which leaked the audition script in question - and in doing so pretty much verified the details as accurate. 


Sacred Symbols has since released a video about this takedown, saying the company had &quot;[forced] our hand&quot; on the matter.

                              <span>Settle down into your Snorlax bean bag and pop down the hood of your Pikachu onesie. Today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents presentation - a Pokémon-focused Nintendo Direct - is due to broadcast today at 2pm UK time.
We&#x27;re expecting around 20 minutes of announcements and footage, including a deeper dive into this year&#x27;s highly-anticipated Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, due for Nintendo Switch in time for Christmas. (Stand by for more Lechonk!)
These shows typically pack in updates on other Pokémon spin-offs too, so expect a brief mention of things like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Go or Pokémon Cafe Mix. And finally, after years of waiting will we finally hear more about Pokémon Sleep?

                              <span>Nintendo Switch exclusive Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has earned the biggest UK launch yet for the series, in terms of boxed sales figures. 


But the critically-acclaimed RPG missed out on becoming the franchise&#x27;s most lucrative launch to date - largely because it launched without its more-expensive Definitive Edition, GamesIndustry.biz reported.


As you may recall, the extra contents of Xenoblade Chronicles 3&#x27;s Definitive Edition are now slated for launch later this year, due to &quot;unforeseen logistical challenges&quot;.

                              <span>Elden Ring has been heavily criticised for its performance issues, particularly its PC iteration.


That&#x27;s why one modder has taken matters into their own hands and taken drastic measures: chopping down the Erdtree.


For the unfamiliar, the Ertree is the giant golden tree that not only dominates the world with its shimmering branches, but dominates the narrative and the lives of the inhabitants in The Lands Between.

                              <span>NFL team the LA Rams may be feeling a little sheepish this morning. 


Following an event that allowed the team early access to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, several images and snippets from the game have made their way onto the internet. You could say, these leaks are ram-pant.


The first image shows off the game&#x27;s upcoming multiplayer lobby, which you can see in the tweet below. This image was originally shared by NFL player Cameron Dicker, although they clearly realised the error of their ways and swiftly removed the shot from their socials. This is the internet, however, and of course once it was out there, the Call of Duty community got wind of it and saved it for posterity.

                              <span>Valve has released SteamOS 3.3 along with a stable, updated version of the Steam Deck client.


The new version of SteamOS has plenty of new features as well as bug fixes.


Following Valve&#x27;s warning a couple of weeks ago about the Steam Deck&#x27;s performance in high temperatures,  temperature notifications have been added which warn you when the console goes outside of the safe operating range. Fashionably late to the heatwave, but handy for anyone who&#x27;s enjoying the last of the summer time.

&quot;We are investigating the attack and taking countermeasures. Additional information will be provided as the situation develops,&quot; reads the post.

                              <span>Nintendo has blamed component shortages for a further slowing of Switch hardware sales, which have impacted the company&#x27;s overall sales and profit for the past financial quarter. 


It&#x27;s not all bad news, however. Switch game sales remain brisk, with more games sold to consumers year-on-year and a solid start for Nintendo Switch Sports (which has now notched up 4.84m copies).


Nintendo highlighted several other first-party games to have sold well over the past three months: Mario Strikers Battle League shifted 1.91m copies, while Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold another 1.88m, taking it to a total of 4.53m and making it the best-selling Kirby game ever.

He described them as &quot;really, really important&quot;, although chief financial officer Chris Suh also followed up noting that live service games account for over 70 percent of the total business.

                              <span>Doug Cockle said something to me once that always stayed with me. He said when he recorded his lines for The Witcher games - he played the English Geralt of Rivia - he did them alone. He never recorded with any of the other actors - he barely met them. And I found that so strange - I still do. But I get it. I understand that in order to give meaningful dialogue choice, you need to cut performances up so you can stick them back together again in the way the player wants. And the greater the interactivity, the more you need to do it.
The problem with this is disjointedness: pauses in conversations where there would normally be none, mismatched tone where there wouldn&#x27;t normally be any. Sometimes it&#x27;s obvious, sometimes it&#x27;s not. And however good the performer - and direction and sticking back together - the result is never quite what it&#x27;s aiming to be: natural. Because it&#x27;s not.
South of the Circle got me thinking about this again. It&#x27;s a smallish game that came out on Apple Arcade a couple of years ago and resurfaced on PC and Switch this week, and I&#x27;m very glad it did, because it has some of the best performances in a game I have ever witnessed.

At under $140, it’s a good deal for those looking to get into Alder Lake and not overclock. That said, there are less expensive options available with similar specifications.</span>

That got started with a partnership with SkyWater Technology and Google covering the costs for open-source projects to see their initial chips fabricated on a 130nm process. Google&#x27;s Open-Source Silicon Design Initiative recently announced SkyWater 90mm manufacturing will get underway for future manufacturing runs. Today the news out of Google&#x27;s open-source group is that GlobalFoundries has joined this initiative and is providing 180nm manufacturing access...</span>

                              <span>Puzzles are fun. Exploring floating islands is pretty boss too. That’s why open-world puzzle game Project S: A Mystical Quest, announced at the end of the Behaviour Beyond stream today, has me raising an intrigued eyebrow as I lower my pipe to peer from behind a broadsheet newspaper. “I say, that looks rather like Breath Of The Wild, but with bits from The Witness and a faint hint of Myst,” I declare to Watson. “Astute observation, Wheeler,” he replies, “but why don’t you have a proper look at the trailer below?”

Good news for them today then, because visual novel Hooked On You: A Dead By Daylight Dating Sim just surprise-launched exclusively on Steam. Watch the trailer below to see a more playful side to four of DBD’s serial killers, which isn’t something I ever thought I’d type.

Wesker’s arrival is the second time Resident Evil has crossed over into DBD, but the upcoming Project W event will revamp the Raccoon Police Department map and bring along familiar Resi characters Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong as playable survivors. Barricade yourself inside the police station of your mind and watch the trailer below.

It combines building futuristic fortresses with raiding them for life-giving genetic material, either solo or in two-player online co-op. Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight. Check on how the post-apocalypse is faring in the trailer below.

                              <span>Even if you’re not “into” PC gaming hardware, spend enough time in its orbit and you’ll eventually develop a healthy scepticism for a specific type of electro-trickery. The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system.

                              <span>All Elite Wrestling announced like, I dunno, three games at once a couple of years ago. They all sounded terrible and we haven&#x27;t posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren&#x27;t on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE&#x27;s series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we&#x27;ll see more gameplay at next week&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

You have chosen your favourite little bits—of games, not corpses—and our quest resumes. This week, we pick between two forms of really committing to a game&#x27;s reality. What&#x27;s better: cameras which actually take pictures, or running into a wall so fast you hurt yourself?

                              <span>Whomst among us didn&#x27;t watch Whip It over a decade ago and think about giving full-contact skating sport a go, before falling over on once and deciding to pack it in? I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can&#x27;t be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023&#x27;s sports management game Roller Drama.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck software update, comprised of both a client update and SteamOS 3.3, is out now. It’s a fat stack of improvements and fixes, too, including a handful of brand new features.
You can read the full patch notes on Steam, but I’ll give you the highlights, which include a new warning that pops up when the Steam Deck’s temperature “goes outside the safe operating range”. When it starts throttling, in other words, a threshold that many Deck owners have been discovering during recent heatwaves. I have an overheating notification feature myself, only it’s just me typing “too hot” in the RPS Slack.

                              <span>Nintendo has released its Q1 financial report for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, noting a decline in both net sales and movement of Switch consoles.
According to Nintendo, overall sales fell 4.7% to $2.3 billion. There were  noted declines in both the video game platform and mobile sectors. The former saw a decline of 4.3%, while mobile, IP-related income fell 16.8%.
In hardware, Switch sales declined 22.9% to 3.43 million units partially due to the addition of the Nintendo Switch – OLED Model with its high unit price to the hardware lineup. But Nintendo said that factors such as the global shortage of semiconductor components impacted production, resulting in a decrease in hardware shipments and a subsequent decline in overall sales.

                              <span>Blizzard and NetEase had a World of Warcraft mobile game in the works, but the companies have apparently canceled development on the project.
This is according to a Bloomberg report which states the mobile version of the MMO was in development for three years before being canceled.
The report states the cancellation resulted in the disbandment of a 100-strong team at NetEase, with only some offered positions elsewhere in the company.

                              <span>NBA 2K23 is nearly with us, releasing September 9 this year. In the build up to launch, we’ve learnt a lot about the gameplay changes coming to the hugely popular basketball game. This includes improvements to shooting, dribbling, and blocking with new gesture combos, AI improvements, accessibility features and more.
We’ve broken down each major change coming with the latest release from 2K, so if you want to hit the court running, check out each major gameplay change coming to NBA 2K23 below!
First, there’s the pro stick and a vast selection of new gesture combos coming to it. Players have been able to flick or hold the stick to do more complex shots since 2K21, but with this entry, a new selection of options are coming for dexterous players. Speaking of shots, skill dunks were a tad too strong last year, so that’s been touched up to be more complex. This includes a physics-based rim hanging system.

This particular update, which focuses on Captaincy, has been long-awaited, much anticipated, and might just see me return to the game. After all, who doesn’t want to be the Captain of their own boat?
The Captaincy update will introduce features to Sea of Thieves that players have been requesting since the game was released, so it’s a pretty big deal for many keen pirates. You’ll be able to hop aboard your ship and get customising when the update goes live at 2am PT / 5am ET / 10am BST on August 4, 2022.

Barone took to twitter to share an unseen-before screenshot of his upcoming project, Haunted Chocolatier, and has amassed plenty of likes and love in under 24 hours.
While still trying to find a way to port Stardew Valley’s huge 1.5 update to mobile, which should release by the end of the year, Eric Barone has been chipping away at the development of their next project, Haunted Chocolatier.

                              <span>We spotted a rare discount on Lenovo&#x27;s brand new Legion 5i Pro 16 laptop, and it&#x27;s a high-end model with a 12th-gen Core i7 processor, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and a stunning 16-in 2560x1600 165Hz display. Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn&#x27;t a massive discount, but it&#x27;s a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

                              <span>With cancelled pre-order comes small discount. Isn’t that the motto of Spider-Man? Well, it’s close enough under the circumstances. Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

to aim for. Of course, Intel and others have made exquisite graphs containing
results for many different encoders (although they might have wanted to spend
a little more pixels on that latest one…), but you always feel suspicious

and I wondered whether this was the primary reason for it doing so ell.
So I made my own test, with the kind of footage I care about (a sports clip)
at the speeds that I care about (realtime).
I intentionally restricted the encoders to 16 cores (no HT, since that was

That&#x27;s because series creator Ed Boone has said as much.
Instead, says Boone, the spotlight belongs to other fighting games during the tournament.

                              <span>Everyone’s definition of value is different. For video games, this means debates constantly encircle the topics of price opposed to content and the need versus greed of rereleasing older games on newer hardware. 

A prime example of these debates comes with this September&#x27;s The Last Of Us, Part 1. A remake/remaster (I’m honestly not sure what to call it) of a game from 2013, this PS5 title will keep the core gameplay of the original, whilst improving the visuals, animations and AI, and add new DualSense capabilities, accessibility features and a slew of bonuses.
The inherent value of The Last Of Us, Part 1 comes down to each purchaser&#x27;s differing context. Some may have never played it before, be that because of a lack of accessibility options or access to hardware, whilst others may just want to jump back into one of their favourite games with some improvements. If this was a new version of Dark Souls, I’m sure I’d eat it up, even if I thought it was overpriced.

For the second quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.64 billion, a year-over-year (yoy) decline compared to $2.30 billion reported during Q2 2021.
That said, segment revenue and operating income grew versus the first quarter of the current fiscal year due to gameplay improvements and seasonal content made available across Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty: Warzone.

                              <span>Tekken is a worldwide phenomenon. This was as true 20 years ago as it is now, long before world tours or stadium esports, with hubs of exceptional fighting game talent travelling across continents and oceans to compete against others in foreign lands.  
Icons of those early days like Ryan “Prodigal Son” Hart paid out of pocket to represent their countries and communities on enemy turf. These days, the practice of travelling for competition is more common with sponsorships, social media, and official systems like the Tekken World Tour boosting the profile of excellent venues run by a passionate few. Now more than ever, your own scene can test its might against the Earth&#x27;s best. For a single weekend, the world can come to you. 
Except this experience may be in jeopardy for Tekken 7 players this year. The Tekken World Tour – an official Bandai Namco tournament circuit that in the past has done nothing but boost the prestige of global communities – may have undone this momentum with a handful of significant changes to its rules. With professional players, tournament organizers, and spectators alike puzzled by these adjustments, what are the repercussions of these changes for the worldwide Tekken scene?

This all started thanks to one animator - Jordan Rutter. A junior animator at Playtonic Games, he started a side project creating a character concept for Daffy Duck at the tail end of July. From there, clips of combos, aerials, and special moves all inspired by classic moments from the lovable duck were quickly published online, gaining traction among the community.
This excellent animation work in turn inspired some more creative juices to get flowing. Technical designer Dylan Micheli stepped up to the digital plate with their own Daffy work - this time a custom calling card for the character that you’d see in game, with all of his conceptual special moves included!

                              <span>Life is Strange is set to receive its first novel for the episodic series, and it&#x27;ll be a direct prequel to last year&#x27;s game, True Colors. Announced via Twitter, the novel is expected to hit the shelves on March 21, 2023.
The novel, which will be subtitled Steph&#x27;s Story, will follow main character Steph Gingrich and her bandmate, Izzie, as they go on tour. This is the same tour that eventually lands them in Haven Springs, where the game True Colors plays out.
This prequel is not the first time that Life is Strange has experimented with other mediums, with the series also having multiple comics attached to it since it&#x27;s conception in 2015. These comics begin where the original game left off and the series of graphic novels only ended this year; if you&#x27;ve not yet read them, there&#x27;s six volumes to catch up on. That said, you can obviously enjoy the Life is Strange games, and even the upcoming novel, without any prior reading!

                              <span>On Thursday, July 21, EA published a post regarding some policy changes concerning mods and custom content in The Sims 4.
In the post, EA acknowledges how mods are an important part of the gameplay experience for most of The Sims 4 community, and it supports this. It also explained to readers how to go about reenabling their mods after they were automatically disabled following the most recent update to the game.
However, EA has also laid down some new rules for the creators of custom content in The Sims 4, and understandably, the policy changes have led to panic and concern amongst players and creators.

                              <span>MultiVersus has been out for some time now, with thousands of players bashing their heads together trying to find out the best and most busted strategies to score a win online. Initial strong picks like Taz and Bugs Bunny have been discovered and patched, but the latest peak of competitive jank comes from an unlikely combo: Jake the Dog and Velma.
Showcased perfectly by a short Twitter clip from user LeviathanMVS, this combo allows players to quickly shoot off numerous hard to avoid projectiles from the pair. This, as you can imagine, chunks enemies for tons of damage struggle free.
Here’s how it works. You first start with Velma’s Spread the Knowledge (down special attack) which has her throw a book towards her ally. If it hits, both Velma and her ally gain a massive burst of cooldown reduction! This at the start of the match, when your teammate is right next to you, is a cakewalk to land.

                              <span>DICE rolled out a new patch for Battlefield 2042 this morning, making it the second since the launch of the game&#x27;s first season in June. Update 1.2 will also be the last one before the new season begins in September.
Much of the patch&#x27;s content was revealed ahead of time. The headline is undoubtedly the map rework of Kaleidoscope, which the developer showed a work-in-progress version of a couple of months ago.
The rework improves the flow of the map by adding a lot more cover, changing the flag arrangement, and altering train elevations. The map also looks different, exchanging the pristine look for a war-torn face.

                              <span>A cheap and god awful God of War rip-off has been made available to buy on the Xbox store. 


It&#x27;s called War Gods Zeus of Child, is priced £3.39, and lets you jankily control God of War hero Kratos. 


Having bought the game and played it myself, I can tell you it is a worthless, minutes-long experience where you make Kratos slash aimlessly at a never-ending stream of enemies in an arena environment, until you give up or Kratos dies.

                              <span>Yes, E3 was cancelled this year, but do not fear. Another show has appeared.


Rising from the grave of E3 is EEK3, an annual indie showcase organised by Haunted PS1.


As the name would suggest, Haunted PS1 is a community dedicated to indie games that are reviving the 90s era of gaming with weird and uncanny aesthetics. EEK3 in particular focuses on retro horror games and has a penchant for the low-fi, low-poly offerings its community brings.

                              <span>Xbox has announced the next batch of games coming to its Game Pass subscription service this August.


Available from today is Ghost Recon Wildlands on cloud, console and PC, the Tom Clancy co-op military shooter from 2017 - we called it &quot;beautiful yet callous&quot; in our review.



The remaining games coming soon are headed up by Two Point Campus, the latest sim game from the makers of Two Point Hospital. It&#x27;s out day one on 9th August across cloud, console, and PC and judging from our preview will be well worth playing.

NetherRealm&#x27;s Ed Boon has shut down reports that the developer would be making an announcement at this year&#x27;s fighting event.


&quot;It&#x27;s time for Street Fighter and other great fighting games to be in the sun,&quot; he tweeted earlier today. &quot;Let&#x27;s enjoy that!&quot;

                              <span>Diablo Immortal has stemmed the flow of falling Blizzard user numbers, and given the company a modest increase in monthly active engagement. 


However, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s latest financial results show Blizzard active users have only recovered slightly - to where they were just over a year ago - and revenue remains down slightly year-on-year. 


After falling to 22 million monthly active users for the quarter ending in March 2022, Diablo Immortal has helped Blizzard back to 27 million for the quarter ending at the beginning of July.

                              <span>The open world of Halo Infinite was significantly scaled back compared to its original vision.


That&#x27;s according to Joseph Staten, head of creative at 343 Industries, speaking on the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences podcast Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook (thanks TechRadar).


Infinite was the first open world Halo game so it&#x27;s understandable there were several changes during development, but in particular the scope and biome variety were heavily revised.

Please note that there will be some spoilers for Hitman 3&#x27;s Ambrose Island map below.


If you venture down from the Western Beach on Ambrose Island, you will come across a small nook in the coastline. Here, there is a gravestone set into the side of the cliff face.

                              <span>I spent five minutes with MultiVersus over the weekend, which turned into ten minutes and then an hour and then the best part of a morning. MultiVersus is great! If you aren&#x27;t aware of it, it&#x27;s a Warner Bros-themed Smash Bros-alike. You choose from a bunch of familiar characters, and then fight on 2D stages. Your aim is to get ring-outs by lobbing enemies off the screen, and the more damage you do, the further they fly when you hit them. Best of four wins. Simple.


Not simple, obviously, and here&#x27;s where an admission comes in. I love the idea of Smash Bros - and I particularly adore the way that the games have become sort of Nintendo museums, beautiful virtual dioramas in their own right. But I am thick and slow and these games have always looked fast and complicated. All of these Nintendo characters, some of which I am happy to admit I have not really heard of, fighting it out in astonishingly swift battles.


I think there are two reasons MultiVersus clicked. Three actually, the bonus third being that I was playing alongside my daughter, whose enthusiasm for these things always carries me aloft with it. Anyway, the other two reasons: One, MultiVersus is new, so there&#x27;s that sense of getting in on the ground floor. Even if people are turning up with Smash Bros experience - and they are, and it&#x27;s helping them - the psychological toll is lightened, because this is a game that&#x27;s been around for a few weeks at most.

                              <span>PlayerUnknown Productions has announced it has hired David Polfeldt as a senior advisor. 

Polfeldt was managing director of Ubisoft&#x27;s Massive Entertainment for 12 years. He left the company earlier this year in March, as he felt that he wasn&#x27;t &quot;the right manager for what the studio has become&quot;. 
During his tenure at Massive Entertainment, Polfeldt worked on many of its leading titles and was part of the teams in charge of the delayed Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and a mysterious open-world Star Wars project.

                              <span>Call of Duty fans are switching off from the franchise, Activision&#x27;s latest user figures suggest. 


Monthly active user data published by Activision shows player numbers have dipped over the past 12 months - from 127 million in June 2021 to just 94 million this year. 


The details are part of a tough round of financial results for Activision Blizzard this quarter, despite the recent and highly-profitable launch of Diablo Immortal.

What&#x27;s more, Western customers will need to purchase the console through Amazon Japan&#x27;s storefront due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, reports Polygon.


The console was originally intended as a Japan-only product, but &quot;by using Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;Japan Store&#x27; system, we found that at least a small number of units could be sold via Amazon.com, so a portion was allocated to make the North American version,&quot; says a Sega representative.

The new price is £49.99, down from £54.99. Customers will now need to cancel their pre-purchase of the game to receive a full refund and then pre-purchase the game again at the new price.

                              <span>A few years back, in a bid to explain Fortnite&#x27;s unexplainable world, Epic Games came up with the term &quot;Snapshot&quot; to describe, in-universe, why its battle royale matches can feature multiple people playing as the same Fortnite character, or why seemingly singular characters available in Fortnite - like Peely the banana, or The Rock, or Wolverine - can reappear under different guises. 


What is a Snapshot? Why is it a Snapshot? Dear reader, these are questions for another time. But the general term, at least, has stuck with me as I try to sum up what Fortnite was, and is, and will be. If you&#x27;d asked me five years ago today, I&#x27;d say it was a distinctly average PVE base building shooter - and the first time Eurogamer ever really covered Fortnite in detail was a preview of this now long-sidelined mode.


If you&#x27;d asked me four years ago, as Fortnite&#x27;s quickly-thrown-together battle royale was blowing up and footballers were doing its dances in World Cup matches, I&#x27;d say it was probably The Next Big Thing. Three years ago? Fortnite was established as a phenomenon, an industry-leading showcase of engine mastery and live service development that could pull off in-game stunts like no other. Want to blow up bits of the map in real-time with a giant volcano? No problem. Stage a giant monster versus mech fight and invite everyone in to see it live? You got it.

                              <span>This weekend the Formula E London E-Prix took place at the ExCel exhibition centre, the only top-level indoor and outdoor track in international motosport. It may not quite have the prestige of F1, but the sport is rapidly growing in popularity.


And it&#x27;s not just about electric cars, but virtual ones too. On Friday night the second Accelerate esports championship took centre stage at the London E-Prix. Streamed live on Twitch and YouTube, it saw drivers going head-to-head to win a share of €100,000.


The esports arm of Formula E grew during the pandemic and a need to engage racing fans online. Now that&#x27;s shifted towards expanding the audience of the sport, enticing fans to watch the real E-Prix through a love of video games and esports.

                              <span>This week marks the very long-awaited arrival of Sea of Thieves&#x27; captaincy update, and developer Rare has shared a detailed video breakdown of its new features - including ship owning, naming, and extended customisation - as part of its new Season 7 trailer.


Those who&#x27;ve been with Sea of Thieves for the long haul might recall that captaincy features were originally planned for the game&#x27;s very first post-release update, back in 2018. A development rethink after a wobbly launch saw those plans put on the back burner, so it was a bit of a surprise when they finally resurfaced some four years later during this year&#x27;s not-E3.


And now, with this Thursday&#x27;s slightly delayed launch almost upon us, we have a much clearer idea of how the update will work, with Rare&#x27;s new video suggesting at least one of the aims of captaincy is to answer player calls for more to spend their amassed in-game wealth on.

                              <span>Netflix is readying for the September arrival of its animated Cyberpunk 2077 series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, with the release of its first full trailer, introducing some of the story&#x27;s key players.


Edgerunners, which was announced back in June 2020, is a 10-episode collaboration between Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger, which has previously worked on the likes of Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill. It tells the story of a street kid trying to survive in the technology and body modification obsessed Night City.


&quot;Having everything to lose,&quot; explains Netflix, &quot;he stays alive by becoming an Edgerunner - a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.&quot;

                              <span>DICE has detailed its imminent 1.2 update for the beleaguered Battlefield 2042, which will, among other things, herald its first batch of planned map improvements based on the player feedback it requested earlier this year.


This initial round of improvements will target Battlefield 2042&#x27;s Kaleidoscope map, and will - as previously detailed - focus on adjustments to cover, intensity, line of sight, pathing, and traversal. These have been achieved by adding new flag positions, by placing new areas and assets around the map, and by raising terrain.


DICE says terrain changes will &quot;break sightlines and let infantry move more purposefully around the map&quot;, while new assets will &quot;bring more tactical destruction&quot;, giving players new options as the environment evolves throughout a game.

                              <span>Apex Legends&#x27; 14th season, officially known as Hunted, is right around the corner, and Respawn is currently in full-on hype mode ahead of its 9th August arrival. And now, following the official unveiling of new hero Vantage last week, the developer now confirmed a major overhaul for its original Kings Canyon map, alongside a level cap increase for players.


Kings Canyon has, of course, been around since Apex Legends&#x27; launch back in 2019, and Season 14&#x27;s extensive overhaul aims to improve some of the ageing map&#x27;s more troublesome issues. Before we get to the mechanical stuff though, there&#x27;s perhaps the most immediately obvious change - upgraded lighting and a new skybox, both intended to make for a &quot;more immersive, vibrant environment&quot;.


In terms of gameplay changes though, there&#x27;s the new Relic point of interest, which is designed to help create a little bit more breathing space on the map in the early to mid game so squad battles are less likely to be interrupted by third parties. This has been achieved by filling the Skull Town and Thunderdome area sunk in Season 5 with sand and building a new series of winding, interconnected buildings for fresh skirmishes, complete with a giant skull centerpiece.

                              <span>EA has detailed FIFA 23&#x27;s Career Mode, which lets you play as a famous manager for the first time.


In the manager career portion of Career Mode, you can use the likeness of a raft of famous managers from the Premier League, including Jürgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel.

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen feedback from players wanting to play as some of their favourite managers, and we&#x27;re happy to say FIFA 23 enables you to play as one of the 350+ authentic football managers, of which 30+ have star heads, in Career Mode,&quot; EA said in a detailed blog post.

This is Digital Foundry&#x27;s weekly show, where the team down tools for an hour or so to discuss the latest gaming and technology news. After a couple of weeks away, myself and John Linneman have returned to the mics, discussing the latest PlayStation 4 firmware beta offering 1440p display support, along with sharing some thoughts on the latest The Last of Us Part 1 footage. VR is also a hot topic too, with Sony revealing new headset features in the same week that Meta ups prices on the Oculus Meta Quest 2 and the massive multi-billion burn-rate on its metaverse gamble comes into focus.
Kicking off with PlayStation 5&#x27;s 1440p update, we&#x27;ll be covering this more extensively, but the headline points are fairly straightforward…</span>

                              <span>A Brazilian governmental filing has given us a rare glimpse into Sony&#x27;s thoughts on the impending $69bn Microsoft buyout of Activision Blizzard - and specifically, the fact that Xbox will soon own blockbuster first-person shooter franchise Call of Duty. 


In Brazil, companies within the same sphere of any such corporate transaction are asked for their thoughts on deals of this magnitude. And, intriguingly for us, Brazil also posts all of these details online (albeit in some cases with redacted passages). 


Sony&#x27;s response is largely public, and contains a number of arguments which paint the potential of Xbox owning Call of Duty in a problematic light (as spotted by ResetEra, and translated for us by Eurogamer Portugal).

Among Us first released in 2018 but didn&#x27;t see mainstream popularity until 2020. During that time, Bromander stated that he, along with fellow co-founder Forrest Willard and mutual friend Amy Liu, were working full-time on Among Us.

                              <span>Early footage of Deadrop has hit the internet, giving us a look at the project backed by controversial streamer Guy Beahm, AKA Dr Disrespect. 


However, fans of Beahm have given the footage a mixed reception - especially after the project was hyped up by the streamer and compared to Call of Duty. In June, a widely-shared comment by Beahm stated that Deadrop &quot;blows out anything from the COD engine&quot;. 


What we&#x27;re seeing today is a look at Deadrop as it stands currently, for those who paid $50 for a Founders Access Pass (yes, that&#x27;s the one which includes a procedurally-generated NFT for your character avatar).

For the unaware (most of us), Accolades could be awarded to fellow players in online games to commend their gameplay - teammates and opponents alike could be welcoming, helpful and more.


But according to an addition on the PlayStation website, the feature is being removed.

Dataminers have managed to access version 1.0 of the game - a version that was compiled on 8th October 2021, before the network test was held and before recent patches could be applied.


As detailed on YouTube by Kotn3l (spotted by PC Gamer), the game&#x27;s most infamous boss, Malenia, used to have slight differences to her moveset that made her even more aggressive.

                              <span>As much as I love Star Wars and as much as I love virtual reality, I&#x27;ve always been slightly disappointed by Disney&#x27;s official Star Wars VR offerings.
It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re bad, mind. I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun with them, especially EA&#x27;s Star Wars: Squadrons. My problem is that they always feel like they do the bare minimum when it comes to immersion or run time.
I think Disney&#x27;s episodic VR games like the Vader Immortal trilogy are a good example of this. The pitch for that series in particular is great. Use the Force! Shoot blasters! Fight Vader! But, it all comes at the cost of a very slow and plodding adventure that has the pacing speed of a Bantha. When they work, they work. But most of the time they feel like bite sized adventures that were built to pass the time in a queue for a ride at Galaxy&#x27;s Edge, rather than be an epic space adventure in their own right.

The claim of copying comes from concept artist and Call of Duty fan Sail Lin, who has highlighted images of their own dog skin design, originally uploaded to Artstation back in December 2019.


Writing on Twitter, Lin said he was &quot;very disappointed to see my work being plagiarised by a big company like Activision in this way&quot;. Eurogamer has contacted Activision for comment.

                              <span>Best Month Ever! is such a (seemingly) unusual game that I didn&#x27;t know what to make of it after seeing the original trailer, or even after checking out the demo. It&#x27;s about a white woman named Louise, set in the US during 1969, where she must spend as much time as possible with her Black, biracial son Mitch. This is because Louise has been diagnosed with an illness and has only one month left to live.


The story is told in flashbacks with a voiceover from an adult Mitch, contextualising the choices and decisions made by his mother at the time. Of course, these are choices you end up making through dialogue options throughout the game, creating a Louise whose future characteristics are based on Mitch&#x27;s observation of your behaviour.


It begins with Louise having to collect her final paycheck from her abusive boss at the nearby diner, with Mitch (supposedly) sitting in the car. Through his eyes, you observe Louise being sexually harassed and make a quick getaway after torching up the boss&#x27; car with an old lighter.

The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

I can&#x27;t keep pace with professionals so it&#x27;s fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I&#x27;m playing Aran&#x27;s Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It&#x27;s a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

                              <span>Microsoft have justified their $68.7 billion ($56 billion) purchase of Call Of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard by telling regulators that the company doesn’t produce “must have” games. If that’s making you ask why they’d stump up more than any other tech buyout in history for the privilege of owning a company that doesn’t have any killer apps in its stables, then you can line up right behind me, bosmang.

                              <span>Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

The Season 14 update will drop in just over a week&#x27;s time, and as well as the customary new Legend - youthful sharpshooter Vantage - we&#x27;ll also be seeing lots of weapon updates, and some important changes to Apex&#x27;s oldest map, Kings Canyon. Remember Skull Town? Well, it&#x27;s back. Sort of.

Whatever the project is, ZA/UM’s reference to Shakespeare’s play Hamlet in the job listing certainly suggests they’ll stick with the keen intellect of their last RPG. If you’re not familiar with Disco Elysium’s blend of ideology and role-playing then watch Astrid’s (RPS in Peace) video below.

                              <span>Last year, I wrote about on how to get my
buggy Keychron C1 keyboard working properly on Linux by setting a kernel module
parameter. Afterwards, I contacted Hans de Goede since he was the last
one that contributed a major patch to the relevant kernel module. After some
debugging, it turned out that the Keychron keyboards are indeed misbehaving
when set to Windows mode. Almost a year later, Bryan Cain provided a
patch fixing the behavior, which has now been merged to the Linux kernel in
5.19.
Thank you, Hans and Bryan!</span>

it up on three of the last four companies I’ve worked for (initially I installed
it using the omnibus packages on a
debian server but on the last two places I moved to
the docker based installation,
as it is easy to maintain and we don’t need a big installation as the teams
using it are small).
On the company I work for now (kyso) we are using it
to host all our internal repositories and to do all the CI/CD work (the
automatic deployments are triggered by web hooks in some cases, but the rest is
all done using gitlab-ci).
The majority of projects are using nodejs as programming
language and we have automated the publication of npm packages on our gitlab
instance npm registry
and even the publication into the npmjs registry.…</span>

                              <span>We’ve finally gotten our first piece of Project L news this year, and it’s a big one. Project L will be free to play! This may not come as a massive shock to fans of other Riot Games projects, but in the AAA fighting game scene this is a massive leap. In addition, it was revealed that the mystical bruiser Illaoi will also be joining the base roster of the game, as elaborated in a dedicated blog post.
The video also gives a brief update on the current state of development for the game. The core gameplay development is finished, leaving character development, competitive or social features. Also, while microtransactions will be present Tom stated: We operate with one approach - if we don’t like it, we won’t do it. When it comes to monetization we promise to be respectful of your time and your wallet”.
As it stands right now, there aren’t many big budget fighting games out there that have taken the leap into a free-to-play model. MultiVersus is the largest and most recent example and while it may have shot to the moon with 100,000 concurrent PC players on launch, it’s impossible to gauge what portion of that success comes from the free cost of entry or the colourful cast. Nonetheless, not having to pay to play is a massive boon for the title’s accessibility.

                              <span>Stray is a deeply unbelievable game. It isn’t the hostile, fleshy monsters that chase you through the sewers which stretch credulity to breaking point. A race of maintenance robots that have evolved individuality and self-awareness after the death of their creators doesn’t seem completely outside the realm of possibility. What completely obliterates the willing suspension of disbelief is the ridiculous idea that a cat would ever help anybody.  

Have you ever heard of a bomb-sniffing cat? Seen anyone with a guide cat? Of course you haven’t. Yet Stray is a story about a cat that not only actively helps everyone it meets, but follows direct instructions. This can no longer be accurately described as Science Fiction, make no mistake – Stray is a work of High Fantasy. 
Stray depicts the journey of an ugly orange cat wandering through a robot-populated, quarantined city, inexplicably bringing happiness everywhere it goes. Every robot that meets it can’t help but beam at it, gigantic cutesy emojis flashing on their television faces. Absolutely everyone is delighted to meet it, melting whenever the horrid thing brushes up against them. Stray is quite simply a work of feline propaganda, creating a deeply unbelievable world where even the very notion of vague indifference towards the animal has been excised.

                              <span>Sony quietly announced over the weekend that it is shutting down its Accolades feature, literally because no one used it.
Doesn&#x27;t it feel good when you&#x27;re playing online on your PS5, and another player sends you an Accolade to say &#x27;good job&#x27;? Sorry, what do you mean &#x27;what&#x27;s an Accolade?&#x27; If you haven&#x27;t heard of the feature, don&#x27;t worry, literally nobody else has, and Sony knows that too, as a notice was placed on the PlayStation website announcing the removal of the feature.
&quot;In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,&quot; reads the notice. &quot;The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.&quot;

                              <span>A vast new sweep of information regarding the future of Apex Legends has been revealed, via an early press and influencer briefing we attended last week. Alongside multiple reveals regarding Season 14 and significant changes to Kings Canyon, we’ve learnt more about Respawn’s long term goals via a Q&amp;A – including info on cross progression, ranked changes, and in-game gifting.
These further out additions haven’t got any date attributed to them yet, instead being tinkered with in the background. According to senior game designer Eric Canavese: “We are actively working on gifting to other players right now, but we want to make sure it’s something people enjoy, something that doesn’t feel grindy”.
On Cross Progression, Evan stated: “We’re actively working on cross progression, but there’s no release date on it. The game wasn’t built with it in mind, which makes it complicated. But I hear you, and I want cross progression too. It’s something we’re definitely working on – we want it sooner than later.”

                              <span>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, the next game from the creators of Nioh, is set to receive a demon &quot;in the near future.&quot;
Announced at Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Games Showcase in June, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a new action title from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, and through an announcement on the game&#x27;s official Twitter, it was confirmed that it would be receiving  a &quot;gameplay trial in the near future.&quot; The announcement was no more specific than that, though it did outline some other details we can expect. 
Like Nioh 2, Wo Long will also have a character creator, which is always fun to play around with. It sounds like similarly to Nioh it will have challenging gameplay, though considering the reveal trailer only included cinematics, it&#x27;s unclear how the game actually will play. But we can probably assume it will build upon what Nioh established.

                              <span>Okay, so we’ve already been over the so-so games coming in 2022 that we’re probably going to give a chance, but what about the games we actually can’t wait to play? 
Well, in this second part of the feature, we’ll be exploring that very subject. It’s clear most of the games that would easily end up on this list have been pushed back to 2023. That said, between the precious few that (so far) are sticking to their 2022 guns, and the couple of your under-the-radar, sleeper hit contenders still to come, this year won’t actually end up being that dire when all is said and done.
As mentioned in the first part, this is obviously not an objective list; it only reflects my own picks. The two sets of games could easily be reversed if someone else was in charge, and it is admittedly easier to do this in our current 2022 than it would’ve been had even half of the games we thought we’d be playing actually arrived.

                              <span>Evo - the largest annual fighting game tournament in the world - has announced the Evo Lounge. This will be a dedicated live show running alongside the show August 5 - 6 that will present new game and DLC reveals, as well as curated highlights from the tournament itself. If you’re more interested in the big reveals than the hours upon hours of excellent competition, this is for you.
According to an official PlayStation blog post, the live show “will feature top-shelf curated show coverage, bracket updates, interviews with players, and exciting content and reveals from developers and publishers&quot;. We know that Warner Bros, Arc System Works, Capcom, SNK, and Bandai Namco will be present.
So, what is actually going to be shown off? While we don’t know for sure, recent events as well as the current fighting game landscape can help us make some educated guesses. The most obvious of which is Street Fighter 6, which was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation showcase. With only five of the cast revealed (not via leaks), it’s likely that at least one new character will be shown at the show.

                              <span>Stray only released just a few weeks ago, but modders have already had a good go at transforming the indie adventure title. We&#x27;ve seen the likes of CJ (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) and America&#x27;s laziest furball, Garfield, make their way into the game so far, opening up an avenue for modders to do what they do best.
The latest mod to capture our attention introduces Spyro the Dragon as your cute protagonist. I suspect there&#x27;ll no doubt be a very long line of future character mods to come, but if I say so myself, this feels like the best and most-fitting so far (aside from people modding their own pets into the game!).
Modder, MrMarco1003, has plucked Spyro from the Reignited Trilogy and popped them into Stray. They&#x27;ve even gone as far as replacing the other cats from the games prologue with fellow drakes, too.

There&#x27;s also that Detective Pikachu sequel for the Switch that was revealed around the same time as Pokémon Sleep, which we have also heard nothing about since it was announced three years ago.

                              <span>Anyone that&#x27;s come face to face with Malenia in Elden Ring knows she&#x27;s quite the doozy, but a recent datamine found that she used to be even tougher.
With the advent of day one patches, it&#x27;s pretty rare that we&#x27;re actually playing the game that arrives on the disc. This is also true of Elden Ring, as the 1.0 version&#x27;s late game area Leyndell had some noticeable differences. And thanks to modder kotn3l, we now know what the 1.0 version of Malenia was like (as spotted by PCGamer).
FromSoftware&#x27;s games and bosses are often very complex, with almost puzzle-like enemies, as their patterns are something you need to figure out how to overcome. These patterns need a lot of fine tuning, and it&#x27;s clear from kotn3l&#x27;s video that Malenia&#x27;s were a bit too tough compared to how she is now.

                              <span>Technically, Smash Bros. Ultimate and new content for it all came to an end back in October 2021, when Kingdom Hearts&#x27; Sora was introduced to the fighting game. However, Smash has continued to live on not just through its loyal community, but through the creative screenshots of its director, Masahiro Sakurai.
Sakurai started, and committed to, a long-standing tradition of posting screenshots from the game to Twitter every day. These screenshots in particular have been of great joy and amusement to many Smash fans, simply due to the fact that Sakurai manages to capture characters and environments so perfectly in each of them. The below shot is definitely a perfect example of how passionate the Wii Fit trainers can get about a fight.
That said, the playful tradition is set to come to an end. In a recent tweet, Masahiro Sakurai shared that it looks as though he&#x27;ll run out of screenshots this August. He claims that he&#x27;d even taken an additional 200 screenshots towards the end of development, making it hard to believe they&#x27;re gone so quickly.

                              <span>There’s a lot to love with MultiVersus. Whether it’s the cool cast of characters, the player-friendly approach to live service, or the healthy dollop of wackiness you really kind of need in this kind of light-hearted title. But for those who care about the performance of the games they play, or have a competitive streak, you’ll be happy to hear that MultiVersus is leading the pack on the technical side too!
This was first discovered by Twitter user Nigel Woodall, a reputable input lag tester - who posted their discoveries online. The most crucial for players is an average input lag delay of 31.47 milliseconds on the PS5, which is less than two frames of delay at 60 FPS.
Okay, so what does this actually mean? Well, in the simplest terms, it means that when you press a button on the PS5 while mashing away at MultiVersus, your move comes out fast. Hella fast, actually. Faster than any other fighting game on the platform right now by at least two frames.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming pirate game Skull and Bones is &quot;not a narrative-driven game&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to game director Ryan Barnard, who revealed to True Achievements that whilst it will have &quot;narrative pieces&quot;, focus on your player&#x27;s own story and has &quot;an underlying story&quot;, the adventure will not be &quot;narrative-driven&quot;.

&quot;Skull and Bones is not a narrative-driven game,&quot; Barnard explains. “We have narrative pieces - in the game, you&#x27;ll meet important NPCs called Kingpins which have their own stories that you&#x27;ll learn as you develop rapport with them by taking on contracts with them. There is an underlying story to the game with which we build the entire world lore, but that&#x27;s not the main focus. We want players to create their own stories and be able to choose the type of pirate they want to be.

                              <span>Firaxis has released a deep dive into Doctor Strange&#x27;s abilities, playstyle, and tactics from its upcoming strategy game, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns.

Teaming up with (wonderful) content creator Christopher Odd, Firaxis&#x27;s five-minute video lets us see how the sorcerer can be best utilised when the card-based strategy game finally drops later this year.

As spotted by NME, Doctor Strange - a support hero - has some interesting tricks up his sleeve, including the ability to heal, protect, and completely conceal himself and allies in battle.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the last chapter in one of DF Retro&#x27;s most expansive projects yet. Across every Sunday this month, we&#x27;ve taken a look at 1080p gaming on Sony&#x27;s controversial PlayStation 3. We&#x27;ve looked at the beginnings of the full HD dream from Sony&#x27;s initial marketing claims, through to the late 2006 launch. We&#x27;ve seen triumph and disaster, along with a gradual metamorphosis, with 1080p coming into its own on smaller scale projects with less advanced visuals - punctuated by the arrival of stereoscopic 3D, requiring higher pixel counts, providing a backdoor to further 1080p support for the &#x27;Triple&#x27;. In this final chapter, we cover the years 2013 to 2015 - a period of transition as the difficult PS3 era yields to the juggernaut success of PlayStation 4. 
2013 proves to be an intriguing year for 1080p…</span>

                              <span>It looks like Dead By Daylight has more Resident Evil content on the way.

Whilst not formally confirmed by either developer Behaviour Interactive nor Resident Evil rights holder, Capcom, credible DBD leaker DBDLeaks has shared some very convincing assets, including images of the icons, outfits, charms, dialogue lines, and character biographies for Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers, and Ada Wong.

Wesker - called &quot;The Mastermind&quot; - will be a playable Killer, and you&#x27;ll be able to jump into the shoes of Ada and Rebecca as Survivors. While their perks are apparently yet to be finalised, DBDLeaks has shared what they say are Wesker&#x27;s perks: Superior Anatomy, Awakened Awareness, and Terminus, which collectively allow Wesker to vault faster, see the auras of other Survivors whilst carrying one, and cause Survivors to be &quot;permanently Broken when the exit gates are open&quot;.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed members of the Disco Elysium subreddit, job listings for three new artistic positions at the studio are perhaps hinting what themes and motifs may be apparent in the studio&#x27;s next game.

Interestingly, fans of the RPG don&#x27;t necessarily think this marks a big departure for the team, though, especially given &quot;how much time [the creators] have put into cultivating the setting of Disco Elysium&quot;.

Google responded to a new batch of online rumours this week by promising that it is &quot;always working on bringing more great games to the platform&quot;.

&quot;Stadia is not shutting down,&quot; the company tweeted when asked outright on Twitter if closure was imminent. &quot;Rest assured we&#x27;re always working on bringing more great games to the platform and Stadia Pro. Let us know if you have other questions.&quot;

Launching as part of The National Trust&#x27;s Festival of Archeology, it&#x27;s hoped the recreation will excite young people and get them more interested in historical landmarks, such as castles. 

&quot;A thousand years of history and we&#x27;ve re-imagined it all in Minecraft&#x27;s The Wild Update,&quot; Xbox explained on Twitter. &quot;With the help of [historian Alice Loxton] and [content creator GrianMC] we restored the ruins of National Trust&#x27;s Corfe Castle back to its former glory.&quot;

                              <span>In the house where I grew up, I shared a room with two older brothers. I was a nosy kid, and I have a lot of happy memories of looking through my brothers&#x27; books and whatnot while they weren&#x27;t around. One day - this is decades back; I can at least remember that it was sunny - I found a paperback that my brother Paul had picked up somewhere. Paul liked science-fiction This was sci-fi. It was by Harry Harrison, and it was one of his Stainless Steel Rat novels.


Actually, it was a very special one, an odd one. But we&#x27;ll get to that in a second. Harry Harrison was a big deal in 20th century sci-fi, a writer who moved from illustrating comics to turning out novels that existed in the raggedy edge-lands between parodying space operas and reveling in their excesses. However he handled things, he always brought an anti-war message that was sometimes hidden, given the rather conservative genre he worked within. Outside of the Stainless Steel Rat books - the Rat is a charming con-man and occasional hero - he&#x27;s probably best known for writing the novel that Soylent Green was loosely based upon.


So yes, the book of Paul&#x27;s I&#x27;d found was a bit of an oddity amongst Harrison&#x27;s output. It was a game book. You Can Be The Stainless Steel Rat was published in 1985, according to my lovely  eBay copy, battered but still with a bit of gloss on the cover. 1985! This means it hit right in the middle of the Choose Your Own Adventure craze, and it cleaves tight to many of the genre&#x27;s standards, like numbered sections that come with choices at the end. As a reader, you ping back and forth through the book following your instincts, and probably keeping a finger or two marking previous choices for the moments in which your instincts fail.

                              <span>A recently spotted Overwatch 2 survey sure seems to be implying that a single skin could cost as much as $45.
As reported by PCGamesN, Twitter user Porterguage recently shared a survey a friend of theirs received that asked about potential prices for skins in the upcoming Overwatch sort-of-sequel. The survey seems to be asking fairly simple questions that are mostly along the lines of &#x27;would you buy this thing for this amount of money,&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t paint a perfect picture for the sequel.
One question asked &quot;How likely would you be to purchase a Mythic Skin at a price of $44.99?&quot; Considering this is essentially the cost of an entire game, that does certainly seem to be quite the price tag for one skin. The survey also asks things like the likelihood of buying a weapon charm for $9.99, or a Legendary Skin at $24.99.

Those of us who lived through the PS3 and Xbox 360 era of pointlessly arguing which console was better know that discussions could sometimes get unnecessarily heated. But former Xbox executive Peter Moore, who helped oversee the company in that era, recently touched on how he &quot;encouraged the console wars,&quot; as a way to elicit some healthy competition in his team (thanks, GameSpot).
&quot;We encouraged the console wars, not to create division, but to challenge each other, and when I say each other I mean Microsoft and Sony,&quot; said Moore on the Front Office Sports podcast. &quot;If Microsoft hadn&#x27;t stuck the course after the Xbox, after the red rings of death, gaming would be a poorer place for it, you wouldn&#x27;t have the competition you have today.&quot;

As reported by PCGamesN, the studio&#x27;s website describes it as being made up of &quot;gamedev veterans and fresh blood specialists.&quot;
While the name of the studio&#x27;s first project hasn&#x27;t been revealed yet, Dark Passenger has gone into some detail as to what the game will be like. &quot;Our goal is to create highly exciting on-line experiences that are focused both on cooperation and rivalry,&quot; Dark Passenger describes the game.

                              <span>The great Nier: Automata church mystery of 2022 has finally been solved, and it turns out it really was an intricate mod.
Over the last week or so, the Nier community has truly kicked into gear over a mystery surrounding a video clip shared by a member on the game&#x27;s subreddit showing an area that had never been seen before. This clip surged in popularity when it was shared by video game hacker Lance McDonald, leading many to question how it was possible. The answer? It was all essentially a PR stunt from three modders unveiling some impressive new tools.
The reason why it was such a mystery is that Nier&#x27;s modding community couldn&#x27;t find any of the files in any version of the game. When Nier Automata producer Yosuke Saito and director Yoko Taro both tweeted about the mod, but didn&#x27;t clear anything up, some believed it could be some kind of marketing move for the upcoming Switch port (which is probably going to be the best way to play the game&#x27;s side quests).

Earlier this week (July 29), Smilegate outlined the content roadmap across August and September for Lost Ark. Starting things off in August, the Pet Ranch will be joining as a new way to spend some time in the game. &quot;The Pet Ranch is the perfect place to play, grow, and earn rewards with your pet,&quot; reads the roadmap. &quot;Recover your pet’s morale, manage pet functions, and earn Jelly Cookies that can be exchanged for valuable rewards!&quot;
Also coming in August are some new activities for the ongoing Maharaka festival. In the upcoming update, you&#x27;ll be tasked with collecting as many leaves from the Maharaka Tree in Maharaka Paradise as you can, which you can then exchange for mounts, animal skins, and more.

These days Dead by Daylight is thought of as the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate of horror, featuring horror collaborations ranging from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Silent Hill. Resident Evil was a very popular one, and it seems like developer Behaviour Interactive has plans to continue working with Capcom, as more characters from the series have leaked online.
The leaks come from the reliable DBDLeaks Twitter account, which recently showed off the models and outfits of Albert Wesker, the new killer, and Ada Wong and Rebecca Chambers as playable survivors. They all have their classic looks, which will likely please fans of the characters.

                              <span>An artist has alleged that an upcoming Call of Duty: Warzone skin has copied an older piece of art of theirs.
As spotted by Polygon, Warzone has recently caused a bit of controversy over a skin that has potentially plagiarised the work of artist Sail Lin. Earlier this week (July 27), Raven Software shared the patch notes for season four of the battle royale which showed an upcoming skin of a Samoyed for operator Kim Tae Young. 
However, Lin took to Twitter to point out just how similar this upcoming skin looks to a piece of their work that they shared to ArtStation in 2019. And they wrote that they believe their work has been plagiarised by Activison, saying that they have reached out to Activision asking for an explanation as to why this happened.

                              <span>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is finally out, and it turns out that you&#x27;re probably going to be doing a lot more walking than in the last one.
The term JRPG will generally elicit a response of &#x27;oh, this game is gonna be big&#x27; in most people. But big can mean different things, like how long the game actually is, or the amount of side quests there are. For Xenoblade Chronicles 3, that comes in the form of the world being essentially five times bigger than the previous entry, at least according to one of the game&#x27;s directors, Koh Kojima.
Nintendo recently shared an interview with three of the lead developers of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, including Kojima, fellow director Genki Yokota, and writer Tetsuya Takahashi. And in the interview, the three dished out various details about the latest game in the series, as well as the series as a whole.

Getting there
As we traveled with complete camping gear and wanted to stay in our tent, we avoided the high alpine parts of the trail and started just where the trail came down from the Alps and entered the Karst. A great way to get there is to take the night train from Zurich or Munich towards Ljubljana, get off at Jesenice, have breakfast, take the local train to Podbrdo and you can start your tour at 9:15am. From there you can reach the trail at Pedrovo Brdo within 1½h.
Finding the way
We did not use any paper maps, and instead relied on the OpenStreetMap d…</span>

                              <span>The last new PC I bought was a Dell PowerEdge T110II in 2013. That model had been out for a while and I got it for under $2000. Since then the CPI has gone up by about 20% so it’s probably about $2000 in today’s money. Currently Dell has a special on the T150 tower server (the latest replacement for the T110II) which has a G6405T CPU that isn’t even twice as fast as the i3-3220 (3746 vs 2219) in the T110II according to passmark.com (AKA cpubenchmark.net). The special price is $2600. I can’t remember the details of my choices when purchasing the T110II but I recall that CPU speed wasn’t a priority and I wanted a cheap reliable server for storage and for light desktop use. So it seems that the current entry model in the Dell T1xx server line is less than twice as fast as fast as it was in 20…</span>

Get it on github.
These release notes are also available on the git-cinnabar wiki.
What’s new since 0.5.9?

Fixed correctness issues with bundle chunks with no delta node.

Background
chiark is my “colo” - a server I run, which lives in a data centre in London. It hosts ~200 users with shell accounts, various websites and mailing lists, moderators for a number of USENET newsgroups, and countless other services. chiark’s internal setup is designed to enable my users to do a maximum number of exciting things with a minimum of intervention from me.
chiark’s OS install dates to 1993, when I installed Debian 0.93R5, the first version of Debian to advertise the ability to be upgraded without reinstalling. I think that makes it one of the oldest Debian installations in existence.

That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren&#x27;t happy that it extends to private servers.

                              <span>To have an extremely timely conversation: how do you feel about this year&#x27;s games so far? And how do you feel about this question in the first place? I&#x27;ve had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that&#x27;s down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start &#x27;old&#x27; games all the time, and maybe it&#x27;s less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I&#x27;ve had a good gaming year, and that&#x27;s what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>The weekend is here. Or is it still Wednesday? Wait. Did you say it’s Saturday? Right. Well, we all get confused sometimes.
I suppose it means that the weekend is upon us, then, and it means that, hopefully, you will have plenty of time to play some games. To be honest with you, I haven&#x27;t slept since Thursday night. Friday evening came around, and it turned into one of those nights where my brain just wouldn&#x27;t shut off.
So, to pass the time until McDonald&#x27;s opened up for breakfast, I played some games and rocked out. With my earbuds in, of course, so as not to disturb the man of the house. He is grumpier than John Wayne when he wakes up. Plus, I didn&#x27;t want him killing my gaming and grunge buzz.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive is bringing Giant Squid&#x27;s mythic adventure game The Pathless to Switch and Xbox consoles this winter.
Currently available for PC, PlayStation, and Apple Arcade users, the open-world action-adventure game has you taking control of the Hunter, who must find a way to lift the curse from the world. This curse stems from an island where ancient gods reside. These gods are known as the Tall Ones.
When the Hunter arrives on the island, she finds a Spirit Mask that shows the world’s secrets. Here, she meets the Eagle Mother and cleanses her of a curse before the entity known as the Godslayer attacks and appears to have killed the spirit.

In June, the studio said the game would see a release in September, and now we know exactly when it will land: September 27.
The game is currently in testing with update 0.14, and those who are flighting the game should know the update is notably lighter than previous releases. It is also the final major update for Game Preview before the 1.0 Release in September.

Whilst not formally confirmed by developer Neon Giant - all we got was a cheeky tease on Twitter celebrating the game&#x27;s first anniversary and a ten-second video - we are told to &quot;gear up for a new contract&quot;, leading some to speculate that it may be referencing new, and currently unannounced, DLC.

&quot;It&#x27;s our 1st Year Anniversary!&quot; Neon Giant tweeted. &quot;We&#x27;re humbled by the support and love we&#x27;ve had since launch. Thank you to our awesome community for sticking with us and for playing our game! We appreciate each and every one of you!

Led by Jakub Ben and Marcin Michalski, the newly-founded studio Dark Passenger will bring the new first-person multiplayer game to Steam, Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X. As yet, no name nor release window have been confirmed.

&quot;The troubled time has come in the Land of the Cherry Blossom when nameless conquerors overthrow the ruling shogun and took over his throne,&quot; the studio explains. &quot;Everyone who dared to oppose him, not only failed but also, against their will, joined his ranks.

Check it all out in the three-minute video below, although it all comes with the usual caveats that the new area is under development and the footage below &quot;is not indicative of the final product:

                              <span>I was 38 years old when I realised I was a bard. I shouldn&#x27;t really have been surprised - I was Danny Zuko in my high school production of Grease after all, and then I was Frank n&#x27; Furter in stockings and suspenders. But the realisation vexed me, because until that point I&#x27;d never had much time for bards. They were, as far as I was concerned - and I can barely bring myself to write it now - padding. Oh the hollowness! Oh the shame! How could I ever have been so empty? Yet, perhaps the fault was not entirely my own.
You see, I grew up on bards as interpreted by computer games, and to me, there, they were a forgettable class. They were there only to serve others. In Dark Age of Camelot, which I spent a long time playing, the bard-likes were the speed buff your group needed to get around quickly - that was their purpose. They could do a few other things but none as well as the other classes could. And in World of Warcraft, another game I put a lot of time into, bards weren&#x27;t a playable class at all.
Look across RPGs and it&#x27;s a similar story. There&#x27;s no bard class in the Divinity: Original Sin series, and in Dragon Age, the whole series, the bard only crops up as playable in Origins as a rogue subclass. Those series couldn&#x27;t be more heavily inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons and yet, the poor old bard doesn&#x27;t get a look-in. And it leaves you wondering why. Or, it reinforces a belief somewhere in your head that bards aren&#x27;t good enough to make the cut.

                              <span>Following Valve&#x27;s pledge to more than double its Steam Deck shipments back in June, the company has announced that improvements to its supply chain mean it&#x27;ll now be able to fulfil all current reservations for the handheld gaming PC &quot;by the end of the year&quot;.


Steam Deck has, of course, been in massive demand since its unveiling last July, with wait times for reservations rapidly stretching into this year. Unfortunately, supply chain issues forced Valve to delay initial shipments from the end of 2021 into this year, with further rollouts perhaps not as rapid as Valve would have liked.


We&#x27;ve had plenty of updates since then - Valve said it would be ramping up production into &quot;the hundreds of thousands&quot; in March, while June saw it announce shipments would more than double in the coming months - and the latest brings great news for those that already have Steam Deck reservations.

                              <span>Shortly after Nintendo released the first wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC in March, data miners uncovered what appeared to be a near-complete list of platforms each new wave would be pulling tracks from - and the recent arrival of Wave 2 appears to validate that leak, giving fans a solid foundation for the giddy speculation of classic tracks still to come.


Following Wave 1&#x27;s release, data miner Fishguy6564 shared a video of Mario Kart 8&#x27;s track selection screen with the Booster Course Pass&#x27; ten remaining cups unlocked, complete with the platform origin of each included track. The then-unreleased Wave 2&#x27;s Turnip Cup, for instance, was shown to contain four tracks taken from Mario Kart Tour, SNES, N64, and DS, while Propeller Cup listed tracks from Tour, GBA, Wii, and a final, yet to be defined course.


We now know, following Wave 2&#x27;s release this week, that those leaked platforms line up perfectly with Mario Kart 8&#x27;s newly expanded track roster. The final track listing for the Turnip Cup is New York Minute (Mario Kart Tour), Mario Cart Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalimari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS), while the Propeller Cup brings Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and Sky-High Sundae (Tour). Notably, the latter is debuting as part of the Booster Pack but coming to Tour later, which might explain its absent tag in the leak.

                              <span>Following an extensive report into the development of Rockstar&#x27;s hugely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 earlier this week, a few additional claims have surfaced, giving a clearer indication of just how ambitious the project was originally planned to be.


Rockstar finally confirmed development on GTA 6 was &quot;well underway&quot; earlier this year, and while official details remain extremely limited, a report by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier on Tuesday shared a number of tantalising details about the project, claiming it&#x27;ll be set in Miami and will feature the series&#x27; first female protagonist as part of a Bonny and Clyde-style duo.


Notably, though, Schreier claimed Rockstar&#x27;s initial plans were much more ambitious, featuring a map that would include &quot;large swaths of North and South America&quot;. Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo has since added a little more detail to those claims, citing his own source as saying Rockstar had earlier planned to have four protagonists in GTA 6, with the action unfolding across three cities.

                              <span>The final episode of imported Australian TV show, Neighbours airs today on channel 5 here in the UK and, considering I’ve haven’t watched an episode in over 20 years, I’m actually surprised at how sad I am about that fact.


Neighbours was a huge part of my childhood, as it was for many other people my age, and it was always something I looked forward to watching after school and then discussing in the playground the following day. I vividly remember things like the death of Daphne after a tragic car accident (I think that might have been the first regular TV character I ever saw die)  and how my primary school was abuzz with excitement for an upcoming episode that would feature the wedding of fan favourites Scott and Charlene. 



One storyline in particular has stuck with me all of these years, though, and that was the time Todd Landers got addicted to the video game Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins.

                              <span>Meta has released its quarterly financial results, giving insight into its recent decision to increase the price of its Meta Quest 2 headset.


Reality Labs, the division of Meta which works on its virtual reality and metaverse products, posted a net $2.8bn loss over the last three months. 


Revenue during this period saw a 48 percent increase to $452m, which CFO Dave Wehner attributed to sales of Meta Quest 2 during Meta&#x27;s earnings call with investors, but this was heavily outweighed by the costs and investments Meta is putting into Reality Labs.

Today on Weekly, Martin Robinson dives into Xenoblade Chronicles 3, a game he&#x27;s just rated Essential and spent the last month playing. What&#x27;s so good about it? And can I play it if I haven&#x27;t played the others? We hear it from the horse&#x27;s mouth. (Note: Martin is not actually a horse.)
Christian Donlan, meanwhile, takes us into the world of Rollderdrome, which looks to be another banger from London-based OlliOlli developer Roll7 - how does it do it? This game is a rollerskates shooter where you need to pull off tricks to power your combat. Donlan is very into it.

For example, someone has taken inspiration from the truly horrifying PT demo, and remade it using the tools from Forge mode.


Spotted by PC Gamer, cosplayer Death Templar shared their PT x Halo hybrid creation on YouTube. As with PT, the player starts in a barren and gloomy room, with only one exit. The difference here, however, is that they have a gun (and I didn&#x27;t spot a cockroach on the floor).

                              <span>Former Xbox executive Peter Moore has said his team &quot;encouraged the console wars&quot; during his Xbox 360-era tenure - as a way to drive competition between Microsoft and Sony.


This competition has helped the industry, Moore continued, and saw Microsoft continuing to commit to video games despite the Xbox 360&#x27;s costly &quot;Red Ring of Death&quot; debacle.


&quot;We encouraged the console wars, not to create division, but to challenge each other,&quot; Moore said, speaking on the Front Office Sports podcast (thanks, IGN). &quot;And when I say each other I mean Microsoft and Sony.

                              <span>Last night, a free upgrade for What Remains of Edith Finch was officially confirmed during Annapurna&#x27;s recent showcase. This was following rumours the game would be getting Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions earlier this month. 


However, if you are one of the many who got their hands on the game when it was included as part of PlayStation Plus, there&#x27;s bad news. The new upgrade is only available to those who actually purchased the game, rather than getting it via Sony&#x27;s subscription service.

                              <span>Sony is still to see its promised accelaration in PlayStation 5 production, the company&#x27;s latest financial results show. 


During the three months ending 30th June, Sony shipped 2.4m consoles, only a slight increase on the 2.3m it managed during the same time last year. 


This contrasts with Sony&#x27;s forecast for the year, during which it expects to sell 18m consoles compared to the 11.5m it sold in 2021.

The new rules, which were announced yesterday, will take effect from 1st September.


Valve is making these changes to ensure the browsing and shopping process is as &quot;clear and straightforward as possible&quot; for customers.

The update will add in: subtitle size, colour and background toggles; speaker name display in story mode; closed captions; and a permanent reticle.


It&#x27;s a small but notable list of options that will hopefully open the modern horror classic to a wider audience.

These amiibo were originally meant to be released along with Min Min from Arms earlier this year.

Multiple women, including some Ismail had met as Assassin&#x27;s Creed fans, alleged Ismail had contacted them privately and encouraged relationships while concealing the fact he was married.

YouTuber BjornTheBear decided to pit the top 21 animal field bosses against one another in a battle to the death on Caelid&#x27;s battlefield, to determine which was the strongest.


This was done over a series of rounds, firstly with each creature at their usual strength and then scaled to match.

I know just about every jump scare in the Resident Evil remake, so imagine my surprise when the famous zombie dogs bursting through the east wing windows set piece produced a surprising and undignified squeal from me in Resident Evil: Director’s Cut.

                              <span>Things are not looking great for the sequel to 2018&#x27;s Tomb Raider film adaptation, which starred Alicia Vikander as a young Lara Croft searching for her father on the island of Yamati.


A new report from The Wrap has revealed that following its buyout by Amazon, MGM has lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films. The studio reportedly had until May of this year to move ahead with a sequel, but that ship has now sailed.


As a result, a &quot;host of Hollywood movie studios&quot; are currently making bids on the rights to the film, with insiders revealing that this has resulted in Alicia Vikander being removed from the project.

                              <span>We have a conclusion! The secret church in Nier: Automata that&#x27;s been puzzling players all week has been confirmed to be a mod.


Earlier today, reddit user sadfutago - behind all the videos so far - posted a link to a Twitch stream that revealed all behind the previously unseen secret church area and its use of Nier: Replicant assets.



The stream showed various assets from the game and the secret church area, before admitting all was done through an in-game mod, which will be made available publicly. The VOD wasn&#x27;t saved but you can still watch clips of the broadcast.

                              <span>Dicebreaker Recommends is a series of monthly board game, RPG and other tabletop recommendations from our friends at our sibling site, Dicebreaker. This month, the team go on the hunt in one of the best video game board games around - Bloodborne: The Card Game.
The Soulsborne series has had a mixed showing on the tabletop so far. Arguably the series&#x27; most popular entries before the release of Elden Ring earlier this year, the original Dark Souls and cosmic horror Bloodborne, have both seen full-blooded board game and card game adaptations, with Dark Souls also making a recent leap into a D&amp;D-like tabletop RPG.
Until Elden Ring inevitably gets its own tabletop outing, the Soulsborne board games are well worth revisiting when you need a moment to stop dying to Malenia and unwind with some good ol&#x27; fashioned cardboard for a couple of hours.

                              <span>Frogwares, the developer behind last year&#x27;s investigatory open-world adventure Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, has announced it&#x27;s remaking Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, a Lovecraft-themed crossover the studio originally released back in 2007.


The Awakened was Frogwares&#x27; third Sherlock Holmes adventure, and the developer&#x27;s ongoing association with the detective has resulted in an additional six instalments in the series since then, meaning it&#x27;s got years of experience to build on as it reimagines its 2007 title for modern audiences - not to mention its further dalliances with Lovecraft in 2019&#x27;s The Sinking City.


Frogwares&#x27; &quot;full remake and substantial rewrite&quot; of The Awakened will shift the events of the original to serve as a continuation of its young Sherlock arc, started in last year&#x27;s Chapter One. As such, it&#x27;ll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an adventure that&#x27;ll span Victorian London, a Swiss psychiactric ward, the New Orleans bayous, and the Scottish Highlands as the fledging detective wrestles with dark, Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

                              <span>In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

                              <span>After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she&#x27;s killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

And now I&#x27;ve returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It&#x27;s a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can&#x27;t quite emulate its predecessor&#x27;s polish.

I&#x27;ve wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It&#x27;s actually two games, and I&#x27;m not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who&#x27;s inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you&#x27;re swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

                              <span>Earlier this month, RPS turned 15 years old, so it only seemed right that this month&#x27;s Time Capsule entry should be the year of our birth: 2007. Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve&#x27;s Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

                              <span>For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that&#x27;s because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

                              <span>Under the Stairs is a small studio based in Zagreb, Croatia, and on July 14, its first game finally hit Steam. From a small, tight-knit team, Eyes in the Dark: The Curious Case of One Victoria Bloom yielded a 5/5 score in our review for its unique take on, and fresh approach to, the roguelike genre.
The roguelike genre isn’t my favourite. While you can catch me ploughing hours beyond hours into various sims that require a tonne of grinding, roguelikes have never been able to keep me hooked for all that long. Eyes in the Dark, however, felt like a breath of fresh air, and almost like it was made for people like me. For people that have just never gelled with the genre.
We sat down with Under the Stairs’ director, Vladimir Bogdanić, to talk all about how the studio came together, and how Eyes in the Dark came to fruition. From indie development, inspirations, music, and even what the future holds for Under the Stairs, here’s our insight into the world of Under the Stairs and its quaint game, Eyes in the Dark.

                              <span>The Analogue Pocket, the gorgeous but expensive modern Game Boy replacement, gets its first major update today – and it’s bringing with it significant new features.
The new features added today are headlined by the introduction of ‘openFPGA’, something which is an impressive new string to the Analogue Pocket’s bow – while also being a feature that has ruffled feathers in the wider retro gaming community. The update also includes the much-anticipated 1.1 update to the Pocket’s operating system. Which is a bigger deal that it sounds.

Peacockingly described by Analogue as “the future of video game preservation”, openFPGA basically opens up the Analogue Pocket hardware to make it an ecosystem for deploying emulation of other gaming hardware on them device – all using the game-changing FPGA technique.

                              <span>The original Watch Dogs was an all-time stinker. Released back in 2014, it represented the absolute nadir of Ubisoft open-world design. It was a dour, joyless slog that had no idea how to actually engage with any of the themes or ideas raised by its near future Big Tech Dystopia setting. The protagonist – Aiden Dogs – instantly became the poster boy for bland, uninspired leading men in videogames.
The whole thing reeked of a design by committee obligation created solely to hype the potential of the upcoming PS4 and Xbox One, one of those swanky trailers for a launch title that’s destined to be quietly cancelled and forgotten about – but this one, inexplicably, made it to release somehow. That really should have been the end of Watch Dogs, and for many of you it probably was. 

It’s hard to imagine a game that had fewer expectations than Watch Dogs 2. It seemed like a mistake at first, something Ubisoft had pencilled into their schedule under the assumption that the first game was going to be a smash hit. Lack of corporate oversight coupled with absolutely zero anticipation probably goes some way to explaining how it ended up being one of the greatest open-world videogames ever made.

 She’d left work to surprise him. A lovely little act of kindness on what would have otherwise been a completely ordinary day. Just another feature-less weekday blended in with all the rest – the palatable home-made protein smoothie of life.
A posh afternoon tea from the local fancy-for-the-area cafe that sits on the park. Sandwiches with pickle that isn’t Branston’s. Cheese that isn’t 40% lighter cheddar. Scones with a hint of cinnamon. Homemade tray bakes the likes of which you usually only see on the TV that are the size of an eight-year-old&#x27;s hand. How lovely. At least that was the intention.

And it looks like you could level the same critisism at developer Player First Games. Over on Twitter, Player First Games’ co-founder and MultiVersus’ game director Tony Huynh has confirmed that some nerfs for the iconic cartoon rabbit are in the works – and they&#x27;ll hit the game after EVO 2022. 
So when is the Bugs Bunny nerf coming to MultiVersus? EVO kicks off on August 5, and runs until August 7. You can expect the nerf to drop after that date.

                              <span>A new Apex Legends cinematic trailer has introduced Vantage - a young but talented marksman - to the game. Packing a custom sniper rifle and their pet bat, we see a bit of backstory teased as well as some hints towards what their ability kit could look like in game.
As with all character launch  trailers, we get a lot of time with Vantage allowing us to further understand the backstory established in the Stories from the Outlands trailer released earlier this week. Cutting between a firefight and a one-to-one with their mum in prison, the trailer (embedded below) gives a nice overview of what the deal with Vantage is.
While initially not great in a fight, we see some pretty nifty sniping skills shown off in the trailer too, which give ample room for speculation in regard to her move set. For one, we see her pull down a visor over her right eye, identifying incoming enemies which fits in well with her scout / sniper archetype. We also see her send out her bat mid-combat - here’s hoping they play a bigger part in-game than a cute sidekick!

                              <span>Fatshark has announced another delay for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the studio&#x27;s follow-up to Vermintide. The co-op shooter, previously set for launch in September, has been pushed back to November 30.
This is a delay of over two-and-a-half months, but that&#x27;s sadly not the end of the bad news. Fatshark also said that the Xbox Series X/S version will not arrive on the same date with PC, and will instead launch &quot;shortly after.&quot;
The studio shared a statement on Twitter by co-founder and CEO Martin Wahlund, who said the decision to delay the game was hard, but necessary to ensure the day one experience is the best it can be. More specifically, Wahlund cited game stability and performance as two key areas in need of improving. The extra time will also be used to &quot;mature key systems.&quot;

                              <span>The diffoscope maintainers are pleased to announce the release of diffoscope
version 220. This version includes the following changes:

* Support Haskell 9.x series files and update the test files to match. Thanks
  to Scott Talbert for the relevant info about the new format.
  (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#309)
* Fix a regression introduced in diffoscope version 207 where diffoscope
  would crash if one directory contained a directory that wasn&#x27;t in the
  other. Thanks to Alderico Gallo for the report and the testcase.
  (Closes: reproducible-builds/diffoscope#310)

Based on it appearing to require patching of the system firmware image, they hypothesise that it&#x27;s propagated by manually dumping the contents of the system flash, modifying it, and then reflashing it back to the board. This probably requires physical access to the board, so it&#x27;s not especially terrifying - if you&#x27;re in a situation where someone&#x27;s sufficiently enthusiastic about targeting you that they&#x27;re reflashing your computer by hand, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;re going to have a bad time regardless.
But let&#x27;s think about why this is in the firmware at all. Sophos previously discussed an implant that&#x27;s sufficiently similar in some technical details that Kaspersky suggest they may be related to some degree. One notable differe…</span>

                              <span>If you wish modern Fire Emblem was more focused on strategy RPG battles and less focused on perfect teatimes, then Vestaria Saga 2: The Sacred Sword Of Silvanister might be for you. It&#x27;s a fantasy turn-based strategy game designed by original Fire Emblem creator Shouzou Kaga with a team of volunteers, and it was released on Steam today with a full English translation.

It was previously aiming to release in September, but in an update on Twitter the developers say Darktide will now launch on November 30th. 

The upside is that they&#x27;re going to run technical tests and betas before the full release, and you can sign-up to participate now.

I&#x27;ve less of an excuse not to do it now however, because a Steam client update released yesterday added Steam Input support for &quot;Nintendo Online classic controllers.&quot;

There was some fresh gameplay for Thirsty Suitors and Hindsight, plus a newly revealed game from Wilmot’s Warehouse devs Hollow Ponds. We were treated to a few glimpses at what Kentucky Route Zero team Cardboard Computer and If Found… devs Dreamfeel are working on too. The latter involves cats.
Don’t fret if you didn’t catch the Annapurna Interactive stream today, because we’ve got all the info you need to know right here. Read on!

                              <span>SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can&#x27;t accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup&#x27;s imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to &#x27;join Prime to save $32 on this item&#x27;.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell&#x27;s willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we&#x27;re seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you&#x27;re free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

                              <span>Goats. Why do they exist, and what makes them so loud? Goat Simulator 3 might not answer these deep questions when it bursts onto PC on November 17th, but you can bet it’ll make a lot of noise anyway. Watch the trailer below for a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s next for the wacky even-toed ungulates.

                              <span>Alice is away this week, leaving the lads to their own devices to discuss the best nice blokes in video games. A coincidence? Who can say. What isn&#x27;t a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That&#x27;s my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of &#x27;nice&#x27; list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week&#x27;s edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of &#x27;best nice bloke-ness&#x27;, Nate and Matthew have framed this week&#x27;s episode as the four people they&#x27;d most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

Now, you can enjoy Stray together with some buddies and/or pals thanks to a new multiplayer mod for the game. This is classic stuff people, because we’re talking splitscreen local co-op.

                              <span>I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

It serves as a sequel of sorts to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, although they’re calling it a “full remake and substantial rewrite” of the original. There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you&#x27;ve played The Sims 4 since then, you&#x27;ll have automatically downloaded it unless you&#x27;ve been playing offline. While the patch&#x27;s release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

                              <span>An update to Minecraft: Java Edition is causing frustration among players over the possibility of being kicked out of their own private servers. Minecraft’s 1.19.1 update released yesterday, but its introduction of a player reporting tool has been worrying players since the update went into pre-release in June. While you’re pondering the future of Minecraft, you can watch a really awkwardly timed, tongue-in-cheek video from Mojang below.

And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you&#x27;ve not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

Cue Stray In Doom, which sends Doomguy off for a rest to let a sweet little kitty frag some demons in his stead. Creator Edy Pagaza tweeted footage from the mod earlier this week, and you can now try it for yourself by downloading it from ModDB. You can watch a trailer below. Aww!

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - the promising co-op shooter/melee hybrid from Vermintide developer Fatshark - has been delayed again. It&#x27;s now due for a PC release on 30th November, with the Xbox Series X/S version arriving &quot;shortly after&quot;.


This will, of course, be the second delay for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, which was announced at the tail-end of 2020 for release the following year. Unfortunately, its development - as with many recent games - was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and Fatshark ultimately made the decision to push its launch into 2022 in order to &quot;focus on the level of quality on release, as well as invest in more systems to support Darktide for years to come.&quot;


March finally brought the news fans had been waiting for, with Darktide receiving a 13th September release date on PC and Xbox Series X/S, but that&#x27;s now shifted again.

                              <span>As is the monthly tradition, August brings a fresh batch of titles for Xbox Games with Gold members, with the service&#x27;s next four offerings now confirmed to be Saints Row 2, Monaco: What&#x27;s Mine is Yours, Calico, and ScourgeBringer.


Calico, for Xbox One and Series X/S, serves up some wholesome life sim action in which players are tasked with rebuilding the local town&#x27;s cat cafe - choosing its decor, baking its food, and filling it with an assortment of not necessarily feline creatures to bring in the customers. It&#x27;ll be available as part of Games with Gold from between 1st and 31st August.


ScourgeBringer, Games with Gold&#x27;s second Xbox One and Series X/S title for the month, is a &quot;fast-paced free-moving roguelite platformer&quot; that sees players, in the role of deadly warrior Kyhra, slashing and shooting their way through a post-apocalyptic world in a bid to save humanity. This one can be downloaded from 16th August to 15th September.

                              <span>Sony has unveiled the new Backbone One PlayStation Edition, an officially licensed iPhone controller created with PS Remote Play in mind.


Backbone One PlayStation Edition is identical to the existing Backbone One controller, with one key difference: it eschews the original&#x27;s black colour scheme in favour of pristine white hues inspired by Sony&#x27;s DualSense wireless controller. However, other familiar DualSense design elements, including parallel thumbsticks, are not replicated.


Sony is promoting the Backbone One PlayStation Edition - which is powered by the connected device - as the perfect companion to its PS Remote Play service, enabling players to stream their games from their PS4 or PS5 consoles to their iPhones using the dedicated App Store app.

I&#x27;ve cataloged 25 such secrets and references in the video below, ranging from hidden developer messages and musical memes, through to nods to famous books, games and TV shows.
One word of warning though, this video does show footage from most areas in the game so do think about paws-ing it until you&#x27;ve completed the game; if you want to avoid spoilers.

                              <span>Seven months after launch, Halo Infinite continues to evolve with 343 Industries embarking on an extended beta testing period for campaign co-op. This is a crucial feature for a Halo title, desperately missed on the game&#x27;s debut - and clearly a challenge for the developer. After all, Halo has transitioned from a linear shooter into an open world experience, with a vast degree of freedom for the player - and the notion that up to four players can travel the map doing whatever they please wouldn&#x27;t really make sense. 343&#x27;s solutions are constrictive - but they do work - and overall impressions are favourable. 


First impressions suggest a co-op experience close in nature to those that have gone before - but only because of the nature of the opening brace of campaign chapters. These are entirely linear in nature and 343&#x27;s strategy in keeping players together is simple: there are certain &#x27;points of no return&#x27; - such as passing a door that permanently closes behind you, or kicking off a new cutscene, that reset the positioning for all players. With that in mind, I never felt that the game was artificially keeping us closer together, it felt like a classic Halo co-op experience. 


Obviously, this changes in the open world simply because it has to, with 343 setting up what it calls an Area of Operation - or AOO. This is roughly defined as a maximum distance of 300 metres between players, with warnings starting to kick in at around the 250m metre mark. Once too far apart, the player furthest away from the next objective is auto-killed, spawning closer to his counterpart. The end result is that freedom is curtailed, but the fireteam is kept together, essentially forcing a focus on the next target.

                              <span>Goat Simulator 3 - which, in a fine example of a joke gone wildly out of control, is actually the direct sequel to the original Goat Simulator - has been given a release date and will be launching for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 17th November.


The original Goat Simulator, developed by Coffee Stain Studios, launched back in 2014, delivering a daft blast of physics-based nonsense in which players took control of a goat, causing chaos, inflicting damage, and accruing points across an open-world map. 


Its goat-themed mayhem struck a chord and the game went on to sell &quot;millions&quot; of copies, in turn convincing Coffee Stain that a sequel was required. Goat Simulator 3 (because sequential numbering be damned) was announced earlier this year, promising, among other things, a new sandbox world known as San Angora, full of quests, collectibles, and secrets.

Speaking as part of an official interview published by Nintendo, Xenoblade developer Genki Yokota was asked whether we would ever see more from Xenoblade Chronicles, given that he had previously called 3 &quot;the culmination of the series&quot;. 


In response, Yokota replied: &quot;Yes it will still go on.&quot; In fact, he said he wanted to keep it going for &quot;as long as possible&quot;.

Yesterday&#x27;s eye-catching report into Rockstar discussed positive changes for employees and suggested this new company outlook could also be reflected in Grand Theft Auto 6, whenever it finally arrives. How important are these changes, and could the industry as a whole benefit? Or should we be calling some of these things out as long overdue, and simply just a bare minimum? 

Also this week, the Nier: Automata secret church/door - the apparent existence of which has been puzzling fans and the wider internet. Is it a brand new discovery? A very clever mod? Or an incredibly elaborate marketing ploy for a new Nier game by the tight-lipped Yoko Taro? Join Ed Nightingale, Ishraq Subhan, Liv Ngan and myself as we try to explain.

There&#x27;s also a secret feature called the Homestretch included in the update that will be turned on at a later date.

                              <span>A year ago today, the &quot;A Better Ubisoft&quot; group penned an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard workers which also called out Ubisoft&#x27;s own management for its handling of misconduct scandals in the past. 


This group has been campaigning for improved working conditions since the company was hit with allegations of a toxic work environment, including numerous accounts of sexual harassment and assault concerning multiple employees at the company.


However, the group says, its demands for change have not been met despite Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot vowing he would do &quot;everything in [his] power to ensure that everyone... feels welcomed, respected, and safe&quot;.

                              <span>Life is Strange is getting its first tie-in prose novel, titled Steph&#x27;s Story. 


The book, which is set to launch on 21st March 2023, will chart the life of fan-favourite D&amp;D lover Steph while on the road with her bandmate Izzie. 


This sounds like the time period which directly precedes last year&#x27;s True Colors and its Steph-focused DLC chapter Wavelengths, which I enjoyed. That DLC included a few voice clips from Izzie in the form of memories, and hinted at a sad end to Steph&#x27;s time roadtripping while in a musical duo.

But some eagle-eyed fans noticed that the polish for the trailer was not all there. 


Skip to 3:06, and you&#x27;ll notice a player doing a T-Pose as the narrator discusses how the improvements to the game make it feel more like &quot;real world football.&quot;

For the former, an announcement on Twitter stated the game would be pulled from 31st July, although existing owners will not be impacted.


&quot;The initial digital game was released 9 years ago, and we no longer feel the current quality and reliability are on par with what Pandemic deserves on digital platforms,&quot; reads the statement.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is old, clunky and boring, but at the same time I am entranced by it. This is history I&#x27;m playing; the game is 18 years old. There&#x27;s nothing you can do short of remaking it that&#x27;s going to make it feel young and exciting again - and Wizards of the Coast tried that last year with Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance, and look how that turned out (clue: not well). So all those lumps and bumps I feel while playing it - all those things that have been smoothed by the many waves of action role-playing games since - I don&#x27;t mind them. In fact, I love them, because they&#x27;re what revisiting Dark Alliance 2 is all about.
Quick history lesson: Dark Alliance was an experiment, really, in bringing Dungeons &amp; Dragons to console. Interplay didn&#x27;t want a slower, wordy adventure like BioWare&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate but something more suited to a console audience - something faster, something more action-packed. So it enlisted Snowblind Studios (which would go on to make something of a spiritual successor in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North - remember that? We gave it 4/10) to make one. There was reticence but when BG Dark Alliance came out in 2001, it was surprisingly well received, so a sequel was greenlit.
This time, however, the beloved Black Isle Studios would make it. This was the house of Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and Fallout, a bonafide RPG legend, and its involvement added a layer of intrigue and excitement to the game. But Dark Alliance 2 would also be the last game Black Isle would release, with Interplay closing the studio and laying off all of the staff months before release, and cancelling a Dark Alliance 3 in the process. People from Black Isle would go on to form new studio Obsidian Entertainment thereafter. So there&#x27;s all this history wrapped up in the game.

                              <span>Zombies have returned to Call of Duty Warzone in a limited-time mode called Rebirth of the Dead.


While we last saw zombies in the now blown-up Verdansk map, this time they will be invading Rebirth Island, which was first introduced with the release of Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War. 


The new mode, developed by support studio Beenox, has had some significant changes from the previous mode to better fit into Rebirth Island&#x27;s smaller map design.

                              <span>Many have hoped Rockstar will one day release a Bully remake or sequel, but currently these hopes seem unlikely to bear fruit.
Now, however, a fan has taken matters into their own hands, and remade a trailer for the game in Unreal Engine 5, bringing it into the modern age.

YouTube channel TeaserPlays, a &quot;Graphics Designer studio&quot;, has released its vision of Bully today (thanks, Dexerto).

                              <span>Steam now supports Nintendo&#x27;s classic controllers released for the Switch.


The patch notes from Valve state: &quot;Added support for Nintendo Online classic controllers&quot;. That means you can use your NES, SNES, Mega Drive, or N64 wireless controllers with PC games.


If you&#x27;re looking to grab a controller, though, they&#x27;re available exclusively on Nintendo&#x27;s store for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.

                              <span>After three years, the Pokémon Centre pop-up store will be returning to London in August.


The last time a pop-up was held in the UK was from 19th October to 15th November back in 2019 at Westfield Shepherd&#x27;s Bush location.


This year, the pop-up will be held alongside the Pokémon World Championships at ExCeL London from 17th to 21st August. The Pokémon World Championships is an invite-only esports event run by The Pokémon Company, but the store will be open for anyone to attend.

                              <span>My wife plays GTA Online a couple of times a week. It&#x27;s not hard to see why she&#x27;s stuck with it. Rockstar&#x27;s endlessly unspooling criminal playground is weird and sometimes creaky, but it&#x27;s still beautiful - no other company has captured the rosy opioid bloom of LA light like this - and it&#x27;s still fun. More than anything, it&#x27;s unpredictable: whenever you go into GTA Online, you always come out with some kind of story.


Last night Sarah was busy, so I fired it up alone. I wanted to check out the new GTA Online Criminal Enterprises update. But this is important for what follows: I don&#x27;t regularly play the game myself. I watch it from the sofa a lot, but I almost never pick up the controller.


Criminal Enterprises brings quite a lot to GTA Online as far as I can tell. New weapons and new vehicles are just the start of it. There&#x27;s also a suite of story missions, though, and this is what I was interested in.

                              <span>The death of a sim can be an emotional time. The Grim Reaper shows up with his scythe in hand, the family gathers around to send their loved one off, and a period of mourning descends upon the house. But, if a Sim has lived a good, long life, this can also be a chance for celebration in recognition of time well spent. 


However, a new glitch was accidentally introduced in a recent update for The Sims 4, and it is fast tracking this whole process. This means that some elderly sims have been dropping dead well before their time. As well as this, children are rapidly becoming teens, teens becoming young adults and so on.


Players are reporting this all happening after a visit to create-a-sim (CAS), or during the loading screens. This is even when the game&#x27;s &quot;Long Lifespan&quot; is enabled.

First up there&#x27;s a brand new mod for The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition from legendary VR modder Raicuparta. I&#x27;ve already featured a couple of Rai&#x27;s flatscreen to VR mods on our YouTube channel, including his excellent Firewatch VR mod and his stunning Outer Wilds VR mod.
On the offical side of things, Straight Back Games, the developer behind the terrifying team-based survival game Devour has just released an official VR update for the game.

                              <span>Blizzard and NetEase&#x27;s Diablo Immortal has notched up $100m in player spending after two months, almost entirely without the game&#x27;s Chinese market. 


That&#x27;s according to reliable app store analytics firm Sensor Tower, which compared Diablo Immortal&#x27;s start to that of Pokémon Go (which took just two weeks to rake in $100m) and Fire Emblem Heroes (10 weeks). 


Diablo Immortal revenues now seem set to accelerate, since the app arrived belatedly in China this week.

It even features transparent face buttons like the DualSense, and sports a place to plug your Pulse 3D headset into the accessory.

                              <span>Stray is the first game from French developer, BlueTwelve, and ultimately, it’s an incredibly impressive feat from the team. Not only did Stray claw its way to the top of Steam wishlists the day prior to release, but at the time of writing, it currently sits at the top of Steam’s best of 2022, even surpassing God of War.
In the words of The Aristocats, everybody wants to be a cat, or so it seems. However, while Stray’s four-legged feline is at the forefront of the game, I raise the argument that it is not the Outsider that makes Stray wonderful. Jumping around as elegantly as a cat would, and causing as much destruction and chaos as one would too, is just part of the fun here. On the whole, Stray&#x27;s hook is the story of hope and friendship at the center of the experience – I’d argue it&#x27;s that which has really brought people together, especially given the tumultuous times that we’re currently living in. I should also warn, if you’re yet to finish Stray, there are spoilers ahead.
Of course, pet owners are rejoicing in the fact that there’s a game for them. I’m not even a pet owner (right now), and this game made me itch to get a cat again like never before. However, I don’t think it is the cat themselves that stirs up this feeling within me. Instead, it’s how this cat touches the lives of everyone around them, including players of the game.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s free update to The Sims 4, which will now allow players to choose the sexual orientation of their sims, a rather troublesome bug has emerged. The bug appears to be aging players&#x27; characters at an alarming rate.
If, like me, you can&#x27;t stand to look after toddlers in The Sims 4, this isn&#x27;t terrible news. However, the bug is not just affecting toddlers. Simply put, no sim is safe.
First reported by PCGamer, it appears that this bug is causing sims to grow from toddlers to seniors in just a matter of minutes. The Sims Community website, however, has reported that the issue is primarily affecting those who are using &#x27;short&#x27; and &#x27;long&#x27; life spans in the game.

                              <span>If you’re a fan of Bully - the classic school RPG from the good folk at Rockstar - you’re sure to be interested in a new Unreal Engine 5 showcase shining a new light on the classic title. Created and presented on YouTube by Teaserplay, we get plenty of character, environment, and conversational shots in the new engine.
The video is currently sitting at a comfy  246,000 views, with numerous fans of the series eager to see the game recreated in modern technology. There are some criticisms of the faces - especially Jimmy’s mug - but this balances out with some genuinely impressive buildings and exterior locations.
This video isn’t a sudden announcement of a full on fan-remake, but instead a concept trailer showcasing what a full on modern remake could look like. According to the description of the video: “We tried to use all the power and features of Unreal Engine 5 to recreate this such as Lumen, Nanite, Ray Tracing and Metahuman to create Jimmy Hopkins and Dr Crabblesnitch&#x27;s face”.

                              <span>This November, the PS5 will celebrate its second birthday. Despite some first party bangers – Returnal, I&#x27;m looking at you – so far, Sony’s machine’s got off to less of a running start and more of an agonising crawl. It’s a problem that Microsoft’s new boxes aren’t immune to either, but cunningly, Xbox has pulled a rabbit out of a hat. The name of its new floppy-eared friend? Game Pass. While Microsoft has been quietly collecting studios and Sony releases a steady stream of exclusives, by Year Two, there’s one clear winner of this console generation: Game Pass.

Boasting over 25 million subscribers and winning over the hearts and minds of value-loving gamers, the slow-build service has been genuinely disruptive to the video games industry. It’s seen this console generation defined less by ‘next gen’ release and more by a shiny new way to consume them. WIth fan twitter accounts happily parroting Xbox’s ‘best deal in gaming’ and fanboyism now gleefully extending to subscription services, it seemed the battle lines for this generation have already been drawn. It was inevitable then, that Sony would throw itself into the subscription service skirmish. It&#x27;s chosen battle-ready champion? An all-new, three-tiered PS Plus offering. 
Rolling out worldwide last month, in these early days, it’s hardly been the valiant comeback Sony hoped for. Following months of leaked information, PS Plus’s 2.0 ‘grand’ reveal was fired out with… well, less of a bang and more an inaudible whimper. Light on PS1 and PS2 classics and looking from a distance like Poundland Game Pass, Sony’s initial offering reeked of a quick money grab. A poorly copied scrap of ‘subscription service 101’ homework. Yet, it turns out, the reality is far from the disaster it seems.

                              <span>Earlier this month, Nintendo released a reminder of something that feels as inevitable as the heat death of the universe – the closure of the digital store fronts that power the 3DS and Wii U, meaning many games available via those download services will enter a state of not-for-sale limbo, risking becoming another piece of abandonware. 

This isn’t exactly a surprise, as Nintendo has a history of outright shutting down the servers and infrastructure for its outdated hardware. The Wii’s digital store was discontinued 3 years ago now. It still sucks, of course – but it’s just a sort of fact of life.

So, the facts right now are that as of the end of August, you’ll no longer be able to add funds to Wii U and 3DS eShop accounts. From next March, you’ll no longer be able to make purchases – though you’ll remain able to redownload anything you already own “for the foreseeable future”.

                              <span>The developer behind Dead by Daylight, Behaviour Interactive, has revealed that it will be hosting its first ever games showcase in early August, 2022.
The event, named Behaviour Beyond, will happen on the eve of the developer&#x27;s 30th anniversary, and is said to boast a bunch of exciting announcements for Dead by Daylight, but also some key announcements for new games and universes. You&#x27;ll be able to tune into the showcase via the Behaviour Interactive Twitch and YouTube channels on August 3, from 1:30 PM EDT / 6:30 PM BST.
If you&#x27;re a fan of Dead by Daylight, which is one of our best horror games of all time, this will no doubt be pretty thrilling news. After the success of the first Resident Evil chapter added to the game, we now know that we&#x27;re in for a second. However, little details have been shared about this, and this showcase certainly looks to clear up some questions that fans have.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal is proof that there&#x27;s money to be made in hell. Though NetEase and Blizzard are insistent that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of players aren&#x27;t spending money in the game, it appears the ones that are have some deep pockets indeed.
Though fans have been particularly vocal about the number of microtransactions and the cumulative cost of fully upgrading a character, those that don&#x27;t mind the expense are bank-rolling the game to some degree. 
New data from mobile analytics company Sensor Tower notes that Diablo Immortal&#x27;s first eight weeks on the (digital) shelves has seen the game take a massive $100 million in player money. That sounds like a lot – and, indeed it is! – but when it comes to mobile games, it still pales in comparison to Pokemon Go, which hit the $100m mark in just 14 days. The less popular, but still notable, Fire Emblem Heroes took 10 weeks to get to that benchmark (thanks, Eurogamer).

                              <span>Sony has shared some news about the next major PlayStation 5 firmware update, which enters beta today. Participants in the US, Canada, UK, Japan, Germany, and France will receive an email today when the download becomes available.
Sony didn&#x27;t say when the rest of us will get their hands on the new update, other than &quot;later this year.&quot;
This is one of the bigger firmware updates for PS5. The headline feature is support for 1440p resolutions, something that&#x27;s invaluable for players using the console on a PC monitor - where that resolution is more popular.

                              <span>Since the disclosure of Retbleed earlier this month as the newest CPU security vulnerability around speculative execution, I&#x27;ve posted some Intel/AMD benchmarks looking at the mitigation cost for the affected older generations of processors. Last week I also looked at the accumulated CPU mitigation cost on AMD Zen 1. Today is a similar comparison over on the Intel Xeon E3 v5 &quot;Skylake&quot; side with looking at the cost of just the Retbleed mitigations and then the overall CPU mitigation cost when toggling all of the various vulnerabilities with the &quot;mitigations&#x3D;off&quot; flag.</span>

                              <span>Here are the slides I presented for a ClickHouse SF Bay Area Meetup in
July 2022, hosted by Altinity. They are about Akvorado, a
network flow collector and visualizer, and notably on how it relies on
ClickHouse, a column-oriented database.
Slides in PDF format

The meetup was recorded and available on YouTube. Here is the part
relevant to my presentation, with subtitles:1


I got a few questions about how to get information from the higher
layers, like HTTP. As my use case for Akvorado was at the network
edge, my answers were mostly negative. However, as sFlow is
extensible, when collecting flows from Linux servers instead, you
could embed additional data and they could be exported as well.
I also got a question about doing aggregation in a single table.
ClickHouse can aggregate automatically data using TTL. My answer for
not doing that is partial. There is another reason: the retention
periods of the various tables may overlap. For example, the main table
keeps data for 15 days, but even in these 15 days, if I do a query on
a 12-hour window, it is faster to use the flows_1m0s aggregated
table, unless I request something about ports and IP addresses.
To generate the subtitles, I have used Amazon
Transcribe, the speech-to-text solution from Amazon AWS.
Unfortunately, there is no en-FR language available, which would
have been useful for my terrible accent. While the
subtitles were 100% accurate when the host, Robert Hodge from
Altinity, was speaking, the success rate on my talk was quite
lower. I had to rewrite almost all sentences. However, using
speech-to-text is still useful to get the timings, as it is also
something requiring a lot of work to do manually. ↩︎</span>

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I&#x27;ve been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I&#x27;ve begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring&#x27;s boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

                              <span>When I sat down to talk to Wadjet Eye founder Dave Gilbert last week, he was in the middle of trying to sum up The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a new point and click adventure from Cloak And Dagger Games that his studio will be publishing later this year. &quot;Usually, by the time a game comes out, I&#x27;ve compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven&#x27;t done that with Hob&#x27;s Barrow yet,&quot; he says. &quot;Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it.&quot;
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce &quot;Incantamentum&quot; correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. &quot;I said, &#x27;Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you&#x27;re going to be adding voice acting to this because it&#x27;s screaming for it&#x27;,&quot; Gilbert tells me. &quot;And he said, &#x27;Well, we will if we can find a publisher who&#x27;ll do it for us.&#x27;&quot; So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

                              <span>There are some things in this world that just take you completely by surprise. Drop bears, for example. It was a total shock, though, when co-father of the OG Xbox Seamus Blackley revealed earlier this week that the Jurassic World series originally started life as a sequel to 1998&#x27;s terribly received PC-exclusive Jurassic Park: Trespasser. You can watch the original pitch trailer for Jurassic World that Blackley created below.

                              <span>More information about Rockstar’s next Grand Theft Auto game has slipped out of a new report from Bloomberg. Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series&#x27; history. It sounds like we might have quite some time to wait to play it though, so watch the trailer for GTA Online’s new Criminal Enterprises update below to sate your appetite for misdemeanours.

                              <span>When licensed life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley was revealed in June, I cringed while simultaneously letting out a little “ooh” of excitement. See, Animal Crossing and animated Disney movies have both long been big deals in the Wheeler household, and the new game seemed to be riffing heavily on the former. A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.

                              <span>The Force isn’t strong with the remake of classic RPG Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic, which has been delayed indefinitely following a badly received demo shown internally at the end of June. Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised. Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more &quot;realistic&quot;.

                              <span>Urbek City Builder looks like a traditional entry to the genre: you place buildings, cars and little people begin to scurry about, and you gradually expand your urban sprawl. The twist is that there&#x27;s no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building&#x27;s resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It&#x27;s out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

This is according to sources speaking to Bloomberg, the female protagonist is Latina and part of a ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ bank-robbing duo.
It also states in the report that instead of taking place in one city, the game will start the player off in a fictional version of Miami with more cities and missions added regularly. Players can expect the game’s world to be large, with more interior areas available than in previous games.

                              <span>You know those beloved novels you always mean to read, but never quite get around to? Ico is my gaming equivalent. Released in 2001 for Sony’s bulky behemoth, this PS2 classic is heralded as one of the medium’s greatest achievements. If that wasn’t enough of an excuse for a games journalist to just fucking play it already, it’s also part of a trilogy that I utterly adore. Falling head over heels for creator Fumito Ueda’s feverishly anticipated 2016 epic The Last Guardian (remember thinking this would never release?) and most gamers’ first encounter with Ueda (seminal goliath slayer, Shadow Of The Colossus), Ico’s alluring box art has always beckoned. Now, with the PS2 classic available to stream via PS Plus Extra, it was finally time to see what the fuss is all about.

Entirely predictably then, Ico hooks me immediately. When it comes to the navel-gazing ‘games as art’ discourse, there’s a reason that Ico is always highlighted as a shining example. Light on narrative and heavy on ambience, Fumito Ueda’s breakthrough project is a majestic mood piece – a universally relatable adventure that largely avoids cutscenes and, instead, relies on its setting to tell its tale. 
And what a setting. There’s a wonderfully surrealist quality to Ueda’s debut that immediately recalls the ill-fitting, ethereal nature of childhood dreams. Thanks to the PS3’s notoriously difficult-to-emulate cell processor, Ico is only available to stream via Sony’s rebranded PS Now service, giving it an unintentionally murky look. Still, it’s hard to care when the core art style is this good. At times, Ico’s odd camera angles and surrealist pacing make the whole thing feel like a playable Renaissance painting; amping up that dreamlike feel which defies Ico’s dated visuals, oozing a quietly entrancing sense of mystique and dread.

                              <span>MultiVersus seems to be popping off in a major way ever since it went live in open beta this week. According to SteamDB, an external tool that tracks the concurrent and peak player counts of games that use the platform, the game has shot well over 100,000 concurrent PC players in the last 24 hours. This makes it, by far, the most popular fighting game release for the platform.
Checking now, the game is showing no sign of slowing, with it nearing a whopping 150,000 peak! It’s safe to say that the combination of the game’s free-to-play model, as well as a colourful cast of popular Warner Bros characters, has charmed the gaming community at this moment in time.
It’s also worth noting that the developers - Player First Games - have some significant content updates planned in order to maintain this momentum. Many will know that NBA star Lebron James was added to the cast upon the open beta release, but Rick &amp; Morty are also set to join the roster during the upcoming season one period. Time will tell if these characters paired with the experience of actually playing the game will keep numbers high in the coming weeks.

                              <span>FIFA 23 will make major improvements to the series’ Hypermotion movement system, EA has said.


On next-gen console versions, which now includes PC, these advances will be powered by new motion capture technology and machine learning animations. 


Dubbed Hypermotion2 by EA Sports, players in FIFA 23 will have a greater freedom of motion than in previous years and move less robotically in response to dynamic conditions. These movements draw on motion capture data from more real-life games than previously, which are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that can generate movement animations in real time in response to what’s happening on the pitch in your match.

                              <span>The free-to-play game scene is booming right now. There’s Apex Legends, Final Fantasy 14, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Warframe – and so, so many more besides. But getting to the front of the pack is hard: there’s an ever-increasing number of competitors, and what was once the domain of experimental up-and-comers is now the killing floor for triple-A developers. Yes, indies can make a name for themselves in the space, but the established studios rule the roost now: it’s hard to be a small fish in a big pond when sharks like Epic, EA, Ubisoft and Bungie are milling about. 

The newest addition to this proverbial feeding frenzy? Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. Teaming up with relatively unknown studio Player First Games (seriously, the outfit doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page at the time of writing), Warner Bros. has wrestled into the free-to-play market in a meaningful way with MultiVersus – a free-to-play crossover fighting game that has pilfered characters from across the expansive Warner Bros. Discovery catalog. If you don’t know the game, it’s like Smash Bros. Except it’s not.
Like Smash, you can select a character from any one of some myriad properties. Instead of Nintendo, though, the roster is picked and chosen from licenses from Warner Bros., DC Comics, HBO, Turner Entertainment, and Cartoon Network. So, you can have characters from Scooby-Doo teabagging Steven Universe, or maybe you’ll see Harley Quinn smash a Game of Thrones character around the face. There’s also an original character, Reindog (half reindeer, half dog), who may quietly be the best character in the game. But don’t tell anyone.

As per usual, Dealabs leaked the lineup, after having posted the correct lineup of free titles for PS Plus ahead of Sony&#x27;s official announcement each month.
According to Dealabs&#x27; leak, the roster of games is set to include Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 Remake for both PS4 and PS5, with Little Nightmares arriving on PS4 only. And as usual, they were right: Sony has confirmed all three titles are coming to the service in August.

                              <span>Wylde Flowers looks to be the magical mixture of farming sim, Stardew Valley, and the sort of spellcasting you&#x27;d expect to see Pelican Town&#x27;s Wizard pulling off (spoiler: his spells aren&#x27;t half as cool).
The magical sim was previously exclusive to Apple Arcade, but it has now been announced that the indie will be coming to PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch on September 20, 2022.
The charming indie has you step into the shoes of Tara, as she goes on a heart-warming journey to become a witch and restore her grandmother&#x27;s farm simultaneously. By day, you&#x27;ll be tilling soil and tending to your farm, but by night, you&#x27;ll be bonding with your coven and practicing spells. If you wish to live out a whimsical cottagecore lifestyle, this could be the game for you.

One such candidate imagines what would happen if legendary adventurer Indiana Jones somehow made it into the world of Elden Ring, with all of its undiscovered mysteries and dangers around every corner.
But we don&#x27;t have to imagine this, because someone went ahead and made this crossover.
YouTuber Eli_handle_b․wav, whom you may know from their excellent Austin Powers in Mass Effect two-parter, has ventured into the world of FromSoftware&#x27;s latest, and brought Indiana Jones along.

Maybe you&#x27;d prefer to see Persona 2: Innocent Sin or Persona 2: Eternal Punishment&#x27;s protagonists once again shunted into the spotlight instead – after all, other than a release on the PS Vita a few years back, many gamers haven&#x27;t had the chance to experience that story at all. 

Well, fret not. Atlus knows Persona fans would very much like to see some of the old games revisited and given the remake treatment. In the Atlus Survey 2022 Special Program livestream that took place yesterday (thanks, Persona Central), the studio published several results from its consumer questionnaire that it sent to fans around the world back in May 2022.

Since then, we&#x27;ve heard and seen nothing from developer Aspyr, which makes today&#x27;s report all the more frustrating.

                              <span>Tactics Ogre: Reborn will reportedly launch on November 11th, according to a new leak. The same leak also includes the first screenshots of Reborn, and a feature list that suggests Reborn is more than a straight port of 2010&#x27;s Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together.

                              <span>Bank robberies are classic cowboy fare. Whether you&#x27;re up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy&#x27;s going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games&#x27; chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
&quot;In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I&#x27;m fucked up,&quot; he tells me. &quot;In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.&quot;

                              <span>The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red&#x27;s fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD&#x27;s limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we&#x27;re starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

Included in the free title update coming next month, you also get a look at the Forlorn Arena.
Introduced in Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Lucent Nargacuga can turn invisible and perform a double tail slam. Its spikes can be extended with the shaking of its tail, causing venomous spikes to fly toward you.

                              <span>Judged solely on its sales numbers and the breathless praise across the internet, you’d think Elden Ring is a matchless masterpiece – impossible not to love. Not only is it From Software’s bestselling game but, at the time of writing, the bestselling game of 2022. I hated it. I think I’m the only one?

Look at my PlayStation trophies, however, and you’ll spot the sheepish shine of Elden Ring’s platinum. Does that mean I have a story of redemption to share? One in which I go from hating Elden Ring to loving it?
No.

                              <span>Sony has provided some additional information on its PlayStation VR2 headset by detailing the new see-through feature and broadcasting option.
According to Sony, with PS VR2 you can see your surroundings while wearing the headset due to the new see-through feature. This feature allows you to check where the Sense controllers are without taking the headset off.
This is accomplished thanks to the embedded front cameras. To use the see-through feature, you can press the function button on the headset or use the Card in the Control Center to switch between viewing your surroundings, or viewing content on the headset.

                              <span>Before it even began, everyone was banking on 2022 being an all-time great. Many of the highly-anticipated games from the year before got pushed back to 2022, and when you consider the games already targeting this year – we were unquestionably in for one of the toughest Game of the Year showdowns. 
Who wins the Breath of the Wild 2 vs Elden Ring fight? Is Rocksteady’s new game after years of dormancy actually good? Will Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga come out this year? What’s the deal with God of War Ragnarok? Will Firaxis do the right thing and take cards out of Midnight Suns? Will the Stalker sequel stand up to the classic games? Will DICE turn Battlefield 2042 around? 
Those, and many others, were all questions on our collective minds around January. The point is: there was no way 2022 was going to have a shortage of big, tentpole games to play and talk about. A few short weeks later, however, reality began to take hold, and, one by one, our most anticipated games got pushed back to 2023 and beyond.

                              <span>Stray is a cat simulator intertwined with a cyberpunk adventure, and as a result, the game is strewn with dialogue and signs that are, at first, illegible to most. Fortunately, B-12 is the perfect translator, however, Josh Wirtanen of Half-Glass Gaming spent some time decoding the language for all to understand.
Josh started out by decoding the chapter titles, which are displayed both in English and in Stray&#x27;s language, and he noted a few differences between translations. For example, the chapter &#x27;The Slums&#x27; is actually named &#x27;Home: Slums Part One&#x27; in the deciphered language.
The same can be said for Sheet Music too. Across The Slums, there are eight pieces of Sheet Music to deliver to Morusque in exchange for a pretty cute badge. One of these pieces of music, as noted by Josh, is titled &#x27;Come On&#x27; in the games language, but Morusque calls that same song &#x27;Cool Down&#x27;.

                              <span>For me, probably the most refreshing thing about modern Nintendo is its full-force embracing of the role-playing genre. No series represents this recently-adjusted stance more than Xenoblade – and its latest entry, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, proves that Nintendo’s recent interest and dedication to the genre is paying off dividends.

In many ways, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the culmination of everything developer Monolith Soft has done up to this point. Anybody can appreciate the game – it’s simply a good one. But truly understanding the depth of appreciation it deserves is likely tied to understanding the history of the developer, from when its founders broke free of Square after finding them too obsessed with Final Fantasy over new ideas, through to its days with Bandai Namco, and finally its time as a subsidiary of Nintendo. Here, the developer works on both original games and as a support studio for more widely popular Nintendo titles. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the natural conclusion of all of those events – and it’s wonderful.
This third mainline Xenoblade title is as feature-rich as all of its predecessors, if not more so. As a result, I could easily spend many words talking about the mechanics of the game – but it’ll probably suffice to say that it’s an interesting and engaging action RPG combat system that features familiar elements from Xenoblade 1, 2, and X alike. At first blush, it’s most similar to the second game, however. And that’s no bad thing. That game ruled – with the odd caveat – and so too does this sequel.

Surprsingly, Nacon didn&#x27;t say how long the delay is going to be. The company simply said it will be &quot;a few months&quot;, which is a little unusual. 
With that said, Nacon promised an update with a more solid release date in the near future. The reason for the delay is the very understandable need for polishing the game to make it the best version it can be.

                              <span>Stray is the charming catventure from BlueTwelve Studios, and the adventurous indie has taken Steam by storm, to say the least. Not only did it top Steam&#x27;s most-wishlisted the night before its release, but it&#x27;s now technically become the best game on Steam in 2022, according to user reviews.
Steam250, a platform for tracking and ranking Steam games, shows that Stray has now overtaken Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War in the process. It seems that everybody wants to be a cat.
First reported on Twitter by SkillUp, Stray currently has 46,244 votes from Steam users and an overall score of 8.61, which simply means that 98% of people enjoyed the game. On the other hand, God of War only trails behind ever so slightly with 53,182 votes and an overall score of 8.56, which means 97% of users are fans of God of War.

                              <span>It may be the worst kept secret in games this year: Returnal is coming to PC. We&#x27;ve seen evidence of the game already manifest in the form of screenshots taken on PC, and via the massive Nvidia leak that happened back in 2021.
There&#x27;s even a whole bit of the SteamDB database that lists the game as &quot;Oregon&quot;, complete with various tags attached that describe the game perfectly.

                              <span>Like each month, have a look at the work funded by Freexian’s Debian LTS offering.
Debian project funding
No any major updates on running projects.
Two 1, 2 projects are in the pipeline now.
Tryton project is in a review phase. Gradle projects is still fighting in work.
In June, we put aside 2254 EUR to fund Debian projects.
We’re looking forward to receive more projects from various Debian teams! Learn more about the rationale behind this initiative in this article.
Debian LTS contributors
In June, 15 contributors have been paid to work on Debian LTS, their reports are available:
Abhijith PA did 14.00h (out of 14.00h assigned).
Andreas Rönnquist did 14.50h (out of 14.50h assigned and 10.50h from previous period, thus carrying over 10.50h to the next month).

                              <span>Latest virtnbdbackup version now
supports backing up remote libvirt hosts, too. No installation on the
hypervisor required anymore:
virtnbdbackup -U qemu+ssh://usr@hypervisor/system -d vm1 -o /backup/vm1


Same applies for restore operations, other enhancements are:
New backup mode auto which allows 
easy backup rotation.
Option to freeze only specific filesystems within backed up domain.
Remote backup via dedicated network: use --nbd-ip to bind the remote
NDB service to an specific interface.
If virtual machine requires additional files like specific UEFI/Kernel
image, these are saved via SFTP from the remote host, too.
Restore operation can now
adjust
domain config accordingly (and redefine it if desired).
Next up: add TLS support for remote NBD connections.</span>

The freight simulator&#x27;s Montana DLC was announced in November last year, and now developers SCS Software say it&#x27;ll begin its journey on August 4th. There&#x27;s a new trailer and a longer in-game video to watch below.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards have hit a new low-water mark on Ebay, where a 10% off code (HOT10) has brought them to £660. This is the price for a Zotac Trinity model, but if you prefer Inno3D&#x27;s designs then you can get one of their cards for just £10 more. Either way, you get an impressive level of performance for half the price that some were paying just a few months ago.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 processors are getting ever cheaper, with the mid-range Ryzen 5 5600 today crossing the £130 barrier for the first time. You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

                              <span>Every Monday, Super Auto Pets shakes its big bag of animals and draws a fresh selection for its &#x27;Weekly Pack&#x27; mode. SAP is my favourite auto-battler, and offering a whole new meta every week has me coming back long after I would&#x27;ve stopped playing. I do enjoy the flow across a week as builds rise and fall on an accelerated timescale before everything is wiped clean and starts over on Monday. Which makes me wonder: what&#x27;s the best day of your gaming week, reader dear?

                              <span>Fed up with waiting for big-name console games to come out on PC after they’ve landed on current-gen consoles? Good job that a Naughty Dog artist has said that The Last Of Us Part 1 remake will be launching on our beige box of choice “very soon” after coming to PS5 on September 2nd then. Senior Environment Texture Artist Jonathan Benainous made the comment to a The Last Of Us fan who tweeted at him about the PC version.

My favourites are when modders make the game&#x27;s cat look like their own real cat, and show me photos of that pretty cat. Then... you have some weirder options, like turning it into Garfield (in both realistic and cartoon forms) or a horrifying quadripedal version of GTA: San Andreas star CJ.

The code language in the game appears a lot like something that should be legible, but it’s not. At least, not straight away anyway. Luckily, these things don’t ever stay cryptic for long. HalfGlassGaming’s Josh Wirtanen has proffered a handy guide to how to read the chapter titles, signs and music sheets, with help from the growing Stray community.

                              <span>It sounds like EA is publishing a video game all about Black Panther, one that sees the player becoming a new version of the character.
The report comes from Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb during his Game Mess Mornings podcast, claiming that the Black Panther game is currently in early development. The internal name for the title is Project Rainier, and is being developed by a new studio led by former Monolith Productions studio head Kevin Stephens.
The &quot;big open world Black Panther Game,&quot; as described by Grubb will see the player taking up the mantle of the superhero after the previous incarnation dies. Apart from that, details are otherwise slim on the title, but it does sound like it will be a single-player title, a departure from EA&#x27;s previous live service leanings.

                              <span>Breath of the Wild is a pretty lonely game, but an upcoming splitscreen multiplayer mod makes it a little bit less so.
The sequel to Breath of the Wild, whatever it might be called, is coming out in spring 2023 (hopefully). That&#x27;s still about a year away, so all we have is the original game to keep us busy. But playing games by yourself can be a bit solitary in these modern times. Which is where modder Kirbymimi steps in to provide a splitscreen multiplayer mod that is entering into beta this week.
Footage of the mod has been shared online by YouTuber and modder Waikuteru, and it honestly looks really good so far. The mod shows two Links taking on the overrun Hyrule castle, and doesn&#x27;t seem to run into any trouble performance wise.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers will be present and playable by the public at EGX this year! The controversial entry into the legendary SEGA IP has previously split the gaming community into two camps of lovers and haters following its initial gameplay reveal. What better way to make your mind up on the title than to head down to London and try it out yourself.
Sonic Frontiers is the first every fully open world Sonic game, allowing players to dash freely between different locations in the overworld rather than having them progress through a series of levels. While 3D Sonic games have allowed those in control to explore a range of vast areas (looking at you, Sonic 06), this pushes that experience to a vaster extent.
As for EGX, it’s set to start September 22 - 25 at the ExCeL centre in London. If you want to figure out what all the noise is about surrounding this game, this is a great opportunity to get your hands on it yourself. It’s also the first time the public will have a chance to test it out, so Sonic megafans eager to be among the first to control Sonic on his new adventure have ample reason to go.

Since FIFA 20, the Old Lady of Turin has appeared as ‘Piemonte Calcio’ due to licensing agreements with FIFA’s cross-town rival, eFootball (formerly Pro Evolution Soccer, RIP).


However, Juventus has signed a new exclusive multi-year contract with EA to appear in their games, in another twist in a rivalry almost as great as the Derby Della Mole between Juve and Torino.

Roller Champions, the free-to-play roller skating action game released by Ubisoft earlier this year, may be on the chopping block soon if Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb is to be believed. If true, this means that news of the game’s demise would have come only two months following its release.
Speaking on the Xbox Era podcast, the journalist from Giant Bomb claims to have recieved information which he then revealed to his peers while on the topic of Ubisoft changes and cancellations. This nonchalant reveal was followed by brief praise for the game, mixed with the shared sentiment that it wasn’t quite exciting enough to keep their interest.

The two will be making &quot;triple-a video games together,&quot; starting off with an action platformer. 
&quot;Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favourite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,&quot; said Funko CEO Andrew Perlmutter. &quot;“By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilising the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.&quot;

                              <span>Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remastered version of the remake of the original game, has had a number of details and screenshots leak online.
While this isn&#x27;t the first leak for Tactics Ogre: Reborn, it is the most in depth one. As reported by Gematsu, details leaked through the PlayStation focused website PS Deals, which even potentially confirmed a release date of November 11. And the title will supposedly come to both PS4 and PS5 when it does launch, though other platforms haven&#x27;t been ruled out yet.
&quot;Based on the 2010 release, the game features improved graphics and sound, as well as updated game design, bringing to life a new Tactics Ogre that remains true to its roots,&quot; reads the description of the game.

                              <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s co-op campaign has been eagerly anticipated for a while now, with the beta arriving just last week, but to the dismay of many fans, the new mode will not feature any online matchmaking. This will also persist even after the mode leaves beta, meaning players must recruit friends of their own to play alongside.
This campaign update is currently in beta for Xbox Insiders. The full update, which includes online co-op and split-screen play, is set to fully launch in August of this year.
Online co-op play does not extend to online matchmaking, however, meaning that if you&#x27;re trying to play co-op online, you&#x27;ll need to recruit friends to play with yourself.

                              <span>Over the weekend, it looked like the name of the next game in the Monster Hunter series had leaked from a fairly unusual source: Discord. The title is apparently called Monster Hunter Paradise, according to the leak - but it turned out not to be the case.
The leak originates from Discord&#x27;s developer mode, which one Twitter user was messing with before they stumbled upon a number of events for upcoming games, including seemingly the next Monster Hunter. 
As spotted by VGC, most Discord events they dug up have placeholder names, except one in particular. The original tweet, which has since been deleted, included screenshots of a game called Monster Hunter Paradise on Discord&#x27;s backend.

                              <span>Multiversus - the free-to-play platform fighter from Player First games and Warner Bros - looks like it’s setting up for an incredibly popular soft launch. Even before the open beta releases on July 26, the game has reached a peak PC player count of over 60,000 on Steam alone (via SteamDB).
While not an official Valve tool, SteamDB can be a good measure of rough player popularity, if taken with a pinch of salt. With recorded user numbers reaching this all time peak even before waves of eager players are let in, on just one of the three launch platforms, it’s easy to see this title becoming one of the big industry victors this season.
Those who have been playing during previous betas have something to look forward too on launch, as a collection of new characters are joining the roster! This includes American basketball player Lebron James who’ll be popping into the game alongside the open beta, and Rick &amp; Morty who’ll both be in the game during season 1.

                              <span>Over a week ago, if you&#x27;d of mentioned ginger cats to me, my first thought would&#x27;ve been Garfield. Now, however, my first thought is of a very different, unnamed ginger kitty from Stray, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Garfield doesn&#x27;t still hold a special place in my heart.
One modder, who clearly has similar interests, has made it so that Garfield finds himself astray in the unknown world of The Slums, Midtown, and beyond. We&#x27;ve seen keen modders flock to Annapurna&#x27;s most successful launch and turn the protagonist of Stray into a dog, and even into CJ from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Obviously, Garfield is perhaps the most fitting of all the character mods we&#x27;ve seen so far.
If you&#x27;re one of the many players that are playing Stray via PC, you can also play as Garfield to your heart&#x27;s content. Modder, Chris Robino, has made the mod publicly available on Nexus Mods.

In this article are more tests of the Radoen 680M graphics looking at the integrated graphics speed-up with RDNA2 finally replacing Vega as a big upgrade and also how this compares to the Intel Alder Lake P Xe Graphics performance for Linux laptops.</span>

sessions, Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings, workshops, and
activities, DebConf22 was a large
success.
The conference was preceded by the annual DebCamp held 10 July to 16
July which focused on individual work and team sprints for in-person
collaboration towards developing Debian. In particular, this year there
have been sprints to advance development of Mobian/Debian on mobile,

to get introduced to Debian and have some hands-on experience with using
it and contributing to the community.

As reported by Polygon, more than 69 million Neopets accounts may have had their customer data stolen in a major data breach. A Neopets representative confirmed through Discord that the company is &quot;actively working&quot; on fixing the issue, and later on the official forum and Twitter released a statement addressing the breach.
&quot;Neopets recently became aware that customer data may have been stolen,&quot; reads the first tweet. &quot;We immediately launched an investigation assisted by a leading forensics firm. We are also engaging law enforcement and enhancing the protections for our systems and our user data.&quot;

                              <span>All things must come to an end, this time the multiplayer servers for a couple of Killzone titles, and RIGS: Mechanized Combat League.
Earlier this week, Guerrilla announced on Twitter that online servers would be shutting down for a couple of Killzone games. &quot;On 12 August 2022, online servers for Killzone: Mercenary, Killzone Shadow Fall (including Intercept Mode) and RIGS: Mechanized Combat League will shut down. Online features (including online multiplayer modes) will cease on that date,&quot; reads the tweet. But single player modes will still be available. 
RIGS is the most recent of the three titles, having release in 2016, and requires the use of a PSVR headset. So considering the age of all three of them, and the lattermost needing what will soon become an outdated piece of hardware, it isn&#x27;t particularly surprising that any of them are shutting down.

                              <span>The followup to Immortals Fenyx Rising is reportedly going to be a Polynesian inspired spin-off.
Another week, another drip from the leakiest faucet, sorry, journalist around, Jeff Grubb, as spotted by VGC. This time, it&#x27;s about that supposed Immortal Fenyx Rising sequel that was reported on earlier this year. Except according to Grubb, it isn&#x27;t actually a full on sequel that&#x27;s in the works, but a spin-off.
Speaking on the Games Mess Decides podcast, Grubb said &quot;Ubisoft Quebec&#x27;s sequel to Immortals Fenyx Rising is not a proper sequel. It&#x27;s more of a spin-off. The production name of the game is called Oxygen.&quot;

                              <span>Steam&#x27;s refund system lets you refund a game if you&#x27;ve played less than two hours, and Refund Me If You Can challenges you to do just that.
While there is a nuanced conversation to be had about Steam&#x27;s refund system, at the very least two hours is a good amount of time to get a feel for most games. Most developers would generally prefer their game to not be refunded if they can help it, but Refund Me If You Can from Sungame Studio actively encourages you to… if you can beat it in time.
Refund Me If You Can&#x27;s premise is simple: &quot;One maze, one monster tracking you down, will you have the courage and dexterity to escape this nightmare in less than two hours?&quot; You play as someone called Sarah, and only you (the player) can wake her up from a nightmare she&#x27;s having.

                              <span>Zenless Zone Zero, the next presumably hit-gacha game from the developers of Genshin Impact, has had its beta test confirmed for this August. 
Hoyoverse has put out a notice confirming the exact time and date of Zenless Zone Zero&#x27;s Tuning Test (say that five times fast). Those that want to test out the game can signup on the game&#x27;s main page, and if you get in you can expect to try it out starting from August 5, 3am BST/ 4am CEST. Not the friendliest of start times to those in the UK and the EU, but you take what you can get.
The test end time hasn&#x27;t been set in stone just yet though, so presumably you&#x27;ll have a bit of time to really get a feel for the game if you&#x27;re lucky enough to be picked for the beta. Make sure you do so soon if you are interested though, as signups close next week, July 27.

Revealed last year, Dragon Ball: The Breakers (weird title) is an asymmetrical multiplayer game quite similar to Dead by Daylight, only within the world of Dragon Ball. And it&#x27;s officially out October 14, bringing one of the most iconic villains from the series, Frieza, along with it.
In the game&#x27;s previous network test, only Cell was available to play as in terms of villains, with Earth as the main stage to play on. With the latest trailer showing off Frieza, Planet Namek also looks to be another stage the you will be able to survive or hunt on.

                              <span>Fall Guys is clearly desperate to go fast, as a datamine has shown off a Sonic the Hedgehog-themed stage in action.
Back in 2020, Sonic made his first appearance in the bean-themed battle royale with a skin of the fastest hedgehog alive. So far any collaborations Fall Guys has had with other properties has been relegated to cosmetic, but recently fans have spotted what appears to be an entire Sonic-themed stage coming to the game. 
The screenshot of the Sonic stage was included in the &#x27;next up&#x27; screen, most likely as a mistake, but obviously this had fans wondering what this meant. And now, dataminer FGPancake has managed to find the actual stage in the game, as well as load it in and play around in it.

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment seems to have accidentally shown off the next Apex Legends character joining the roster.
You might remember that back in March there was quite a big Apex Legends leak showing nine potential new characters, including the most recent addition Newcastle. Now it seems that Respawn itself has accidentally shown a brief preview of the next character joining the game, advertising a potential upcoming Stories from the Outlands. If you want to wait for the official reveal though, maybe skip this one.
As reported by Dot Esports, one fan spotted this preview in the Apex client yesterday (July 23), inviting players to watch a Stories from the Outland episode titled Survive. &quot;There&#x27;s a new installment of the Stories from the Outlands!&quot; reads the description. &quot;Watch survive and meet the new Legend joining the Games in Apex Legends: Hunted, coming August 9!&quot;

but it looks like enough of the required parts may finally align,
and it seems it&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ll have to go to get to that next quality
level. (Specifically, I&#x27;d like to go from 720p60 to 1080p60 for sports,
and it seems this is hard to do under H.264 as-is without making pretty
big concessions in terms of artifacts/smudges, or else jack up the
bitrate so much that clients will start having viewing problems.)
After some brief testing, it seems
SVT-AV1 is the obvious choice;
if you&#x27;ve got the cores, it produces pretty good-looking 10-bit AV1 using
less CPU time than x264 veryfast (!), possibly mostly due to better
parallelization. But information about using it for live streaming was hard
to find, and asking online turne…</span>

Now Ex-Zodiac has entered early access, and it looks like it&#x27;s got more going on than straight homage. Fox McCloud never rode a motorbike, for one.

In a lengthy development update, they say the switch should make it easier to patch and maintain the game after release, among other benefits. They also show off some fancy creator tools, and say Hytale won&#x27;t release in 2023.

To compensate, I decided to watch Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns latest trailer while pretending it wasn&#x27;t about Marvel superheroes, but just a Firaxis-made tactics game with character classes who have wildly divergent skillsets. The video focuses on the spider-powered class - and heck, it does look pretty cool.

                              <span>Almost 2 decades ago, Planet Debian was
created using the &quot;planetplanet&quot; RSS aggregator. A short while later, I
created Planet Grep using the same software.
Over the years, the blog aggregator landscape has changed a bit. First
of all, planetplanet was abandoned, forked into Planet
Venus, and then abandoned again.
Second, the world of blogging (aka the &quot;blogosphere&quot;) has disappeared
much, and the more modern world uses things like &quot;Social Networks&quot;, etc,

Debconf 22 is happening in Prizren, Kosovo.
And it has been my pleasure to again be here and take lots of pictures of the
event and of the surroundings.
The photos can be found in this Google Photo shared album and also on
this git-lfs share.
But the main photographic delight, as always is the DebConf 22 Group Photo.
And here it is!!!

You can also see it in:

                              <span>Back in 2020, I wrote this article about using DKIM to sign outgoing
debian.org mail. This worked well
for me for a while: outgoing mail was signed with DKIM and somehow was
delivered. Maybe. Who knows.
But now we have a relay server which makes this kind of moot. So
I have changed my configuration to use that relay instead of sending
email on my own. It seems more reliable that mail seems to be coming
from a real debian.org machine, so I&#x27;m hoping this will have better
reputation than my current setup.
In general, you should follow the DSA documentation which includes a
Postfix configuration. In my case, it was basically this patch:

                              <span>With the recent resurgence in Covid19 I’ve been working from home a lot and using both my work laptop and personal PC on the same monitor. HDMI KVM switches start at $150 and I didn’t feel like buying one. So I wrote a script to change inputs on my monitor. The following script locks the session on the local machine and switches the monitor’s input to the other machine. I ran the command “ddcutil  vcpinfo| grep Input” which shows that (on my monitor at least) 60 is the VCP for input. Then I ran the command “ddcutil getvcp 60” to get the current value and tried setting values sequentially to find the value for the other port.
Below is the script I’m using on one system, the other is the same but setting the different port via setvcp. The loginctl command is to lock the screen to prevent accidental keyboard or mouse input from messing anything up.
# lock the session, assumes that seat0 is the only session
loginctl lock-session $(loginctl list-sessions|grep &quot;seat0 *$&quot;|cut -c1-7)
# 0xf is DisplayPort, 0x11 is HDMI-1
ddcutil setvcp 60 0x11
For keyboard, mouse, and speakers I’m using a USB 2.0 hub that I can switch between computers. I idly considered getting a three-pole double-throw switch (four pole switches aren’t available at my local electronic store) to switch USB 2.0 as I only need to switch 3 of the 4 wires. But for the moment just plugging the hub into different systems is enough, I only do that a couple of times a day.

                              <span>Pretty much everyone who has spent some time on a command line in Linux would have looked at the free command. This command provides some overall statistics on the memory and how it is used. Typical output looks something like this:
             total        used        free      shared  buff/cache  available
Mem:      32717924     3101156    26950016      143608     2666752  29011928
Swap:      1000444           0     1000444


Memory sits in the first row after the headers then we have the swap statistics. Most of the numbers are directly fetched from the procfs file /proc/meminfo which are scaled and presented to the user.  A good example of a “simple” stat is total, which is just the MemTotal row located in that file. For the rest of this post, I’ll make the rows from /proc/meminfo hav…</span>

                              <span>Among my collection of PC hardware, I have a few rarities whose netboot implementation predates PXE. Since I recently managed to configure dnsmasq as a potent TFTP and PXE server, I figured that I&#x27;d try chainloading iPXE via BOOTP options. This required preparing a boot image using antiquated tools:
$ sudo mkelf-linux --param&#x3D;autoboot --output&#x3D;/srv/tftp/ipxe.nbi /srv/tftp/ipxe.lkrn

The host succesufully loads the boot image, except that the iPXE blob fails to find the network card:

Debian Conference, is taking place in Prizren, Kosovo
from July 17th to 24th, 2022.
Debian contributors from all over the world have come together at
Innovation and Training Park (ITP)
in Prizren, Kosovo, to participate and work in a conference exclusively
run by volunteers.
Today the main conference starts with over 270 attendants expected
and 82 activities scheduled,
including 45-minute and 20-minute talks and team meetings (&quot;BoF&quot;),
workshops, and a job fair, as well as a variety of other events.
The full schedule at
https://debconf2.debconf.org/schedule/
is updated every day, including activities planned ad-hoc
by attendees during the whole conference.
If you want to engage remotely, you can follow the
video streaming available from the DebConf22 website
of the events happening in the three talk rooms:
Drini, Lumbardhi and Ereniku.
Or you can join the conversation about what is happening
in the talk rooms:
  #debconf-drini,
  #debconf-lumbardhi and
  #debconf-ereniku
(all those channels in the OFTC IRC network).

Sector General novels, except
with a diplomat rather than a doctor.  The aliens are moderately strange
(not just humans in prosthetic makeup), but are mostly earnest,
well-meaning, and welcoming.  Trang&#x27;s security escort is more military
than he expects, but that becomes a satisfying negotiation rather than an
ongoing problem.  There is confusion, misunderstandings, and even
violence, but most of it is sorted out by earnest discussion and attempts
at mutual understanding.



This is, in other words, diplomat

                              <span>While working on a CNC with servo motors controlled by the
LinuxCNC
PID
controller, I recently had to learn how to tune the collection of values
that control such mathematical machinery that a PID controller is.  It
proved to be a lot harder than I hoped, and I still have not succeeded
in getting the Z PID controller to successfully defy gravity, nor X
and Y to move accurately and reliably.  But while climbing up this
rather steep learning curve, I discovered that some motor control
systems are able to tune their PID controllers.  I got the impression
from the documentation that LinuxCNC were not.  This proved to be not
true
The LinuxCNC
pid
component is the recommended PID controller to use.  It uses eight
constants Pgain, Igain, Dgain,
bias, FF0, FF1, FF2 and
FF3 to calculate the output …</span>

                              <span>I arrived in Prizren late on Wednesday. Here’s what I did during debcamp (so over 3 days). I hope this post just motivates others to contribute more to Debian.
At least 2 DDs want to upload packages that need a new version of python3-jsonschema (ie: version &gt; 4.x). Unfortunately, version 4 broke a few packages. I therefore uploaded it to Experimental a few months/week, so I could see the result of autopkgtest reading the pseudo excuse page. And it showed a few packages broke. Here’s the one used (or part of) OpenStack:
Nova
Designate
Ironic
python-warlock
Sahara
Vitrage




Thanks to a reactive upstream, I was able to fix the first 4 above, but not Sahara yet. Vitrage poped-up when I uploade Debian release 2 of jsonschema, surprisingly. Also python3-jsonschema autopkgtest itself was broken…</span>

                              <span>INN 2.7.0 NEWS file for all
of the details, including breaking changes to watch out for when
upgrading.



INN 2.7 is now the stable branch, and will be maintained on the 2.7 Git
branch.  The main branch is now open for development targeting 2.8.0.
(I&#x27;m still hoping to get to the build system overhaul before 2.8.0 is
released.)  As of tonight, if all goes well, the nightly stable snapshots
will be generated from the 2.7 branch instead of the 2.6 branch, so be
aware that you will need to pay close attention to the upgrade if you&#x27;re
using a snapshot.



As always, thanks to Julien ÉLIE for preparing this release and doing most
of the maintenance work on INN!



You can get the latest version from
the official ISC download
page or from my personal INN pages.  The
latter also has links to the other INN documentation.</span>

                              <span>Git-cinnabar is a git remote helper to interact with mercurial repositories. It allows to clone, pull and push from/to mercurial remote repositories, using git.
Get it on github.
These release notes are also available on the git-cinnabar wiki.
What’s new since 0.5.8?
Updated git to 2.37.1 for the helper.
Various python 3 fixes.
Fixed stream bundle
Added python and py.exe as executables tried on top of python3 and python2.
Improved handling of ill-formed local urls.
Fixed using old mercurial libraries that don’t support bundlev2 with a server that does.
When fsck reports the metadata as broken, prevent further updates to the repo.
When issue #207 is detected, mark the metadata as broken
Added support for logging redirection to a file
Now ignore refs/cinnabar/replace/ refs, and always use the corresponding metadata instead.
Various git cinnabar fsck fixes.</span>

                              <span>Three members of the Debian Perl Group
met in Hamburg between May 23 and May 30 2022 as part of the 
Debian Reunion Hamburg
to continue perl development work for Bookworm and to work on QA tasks across
our 3800+ packages.
The participants had a good time and met other Debian friends. The
sprint was also productive:
pkg-perl-tools and dh-make-perl were improved and extended.
More than 50 uploads were done, and more than 30 bugs were fixed or at least triaged.
autopkgtests were added to lots of packages.
Some requests to remove obsolete packages were filed as well.
The more detailed report
was posted to the Debian Perl mailing list.
The participants would like to thank the Debian Reunion Hamburg organizers
for providing the framework for our sprint, all sponsors of the event, and
all donors to the Debian project who helped to cover parts of our expenses.</span>

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been working with simple/trivial scripting languages, and I guess I finally reached a point where I thought &quot;Lisp?  Why not&quot;.  One of the reasons for recent experimentation was thinking about the kind of minimalism that makes implementing a language less work - being able to actually use the language to write itself.
FORTH is my recurring example, because implementing it mostly means writing a virtual machine which consists of memory (&quot;cells&quot;) along with a pair of stacks, and some primitives for operating upon them.   Once you have that groundwork in place you can layer the higher-level constructs (such as &quot;for&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, etc).
Lisp allows a similar approach, albeit with slightly fewer low-level details required, and far less tortuous thinking.  Lisp always feels higher-level to…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been wanting to use my brand new NitroKey 3, but TOTP is not supported yet. So, I’m looking to implement it myself, since firmware and tooling are open-source.
NitroKey 3’s firmware is based on Trussed framework. In essence, it’s been designed so that anyone can implement an independent Trussed application. Each such application is like a module that can be added to Trussed-based product. So if I write a Trussed app, I’d be able to add it to NK3’s firmware.</span>

                              <span>FOAAS by now moved to version 2.3.2 in its repo. This releases 2.3.2 of rfoaas catches up, and brings the first release in about two and a half years.
This 2.3.2 release of FOAAS brings us six new REST access points: absolutely(), dense(), dumbledore(), lowpoly(), understand(), and yeah(). Along with these new functions, documentation and tests were updated.
My CRANberries service provides a diff to the previous CRAN release. Questions, comments etc should go to the GitHub issue tracker. More background information is on the project page as well as on the github repo

&quot;Secured-core&quot; is a term used to describe machines that meet a certain set of Microsoft requirements around firmware security, and by and large it&#x27;s a good thing - devices that meet these requirements are resilient against a whole bunch of potential attacks in the early boot process. But unfortunately the 2022 requirements don&#x27;t seem to be publicly available, so it&#x27;s difficult to know what&#x27;s being asked for and why. But first, some background.
Most x86 UEFI systems that support Secure Boot trust at least two certificate author…</span>

Thanks, as ever, due to the release team for actually giving us an update, the press team for announcements - and, of course, the various sponsors, administrators and maintainers of Debian infrastructure like cdimage.debian.org and the CD building machines.
It&#x27;s been a quiet release for the media team in terms of participation - we&#x27;ve not had our usual tester for debian-edu and it&#x27;s been a bit subdued altogether.
Not even as many blog posts as usual: I suppose I&#x27;ll make up for it in August at the BBQ in Cambridge - if we don&#x27;t all get another lockdown / COVID-19 variants / fuel prices at ££££ per litre to dissuade us.</span>

Thanks, as ever, to the crew: RattusRattus and Isy, Sledge struggling through feeling awful. No debian-edu testing today, unfortunately, but that almost never breaks anyway.
Everyone&#x27;s getting geared up for Kosovo - you&#x27;ll see the other three there with any luck - and you&#x27;d catch all of us at the BBQ in Cambridge. It&#x27;s going to be a hugely busy month and a bit for Steve and the others. :)</span>

Testing on the standard install media is pretty much done: Isy, Andy and Sledge have moved on to testing the live images.
Stupidly hot for UK - it&#x27;s 28 degrees indoors with windows open.
All good so far :)</span>

                              <span>The Rcpp team is please to announce the newest release 1.0.9 of Rcpp which hit CRAN late yesterday, and has been uploaded to Debian as well. Windows and macOS builds should appear at CRAN in the next few days, as will builds in different Linux distribution and of course at r2u. The release was prepared om July 2, but it took a few days to clear a handful of spurious errors as false positives with CRAN — this can when the set of reverse dependencies is so large, and the CRAN team remains busy. This release continues with the six-months cycle started with release 1.0.5 in July 2020. (This time, CRAN had asked for an interim release to silence a C++ warning; we then needed a quick follow-up to tweak tests.) As a reminder, interim ‘dev’ or ‘rc’ releases should generally be available in the Rcp…</span>

                              <span>I finally managed to get hold of a Thinkpad Z13 to examine a functional implementation of Microsoft&#x27;s Pluton security co-processor. Trying to boot Linux from a USB stick failed out of the box for no obvious reason, but after further examination the cause became clear - the firmware defaults to not trusting bootloaders or drivers signed with the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA key. This means that given the default firmware configuration, nothing other than Windows will boot. It also means that you won&#x27;t be able to boot from any third-party external peripherals that are plugged in via Thunderbolt.
There&#x27;s no security benefit to this. If you want security here you&#x27;re paying attention to the values measured into the TPM, and thanks to Microsoft&#x27;s own specification for measurements made into PCR 7, switching from booting Windows to booting something signed with the 3rd party signing key will change the measurements and invalidate any sealed secrets. It&#x27;s trivial to detect this. Distrusting the 3rd party CA by default doesn&#x27;t improve security, it just makes it harder for users to boot alternative operating systems.
Lenovo, this isn&#x27;t OK. The entire architecture of UEFI secure boot is that it allows for security without compromising user choice of OS. Restricting boot to Windows by default provides no security benefit but makes it harder for people to run the OS they want to. Please fix it.

                              <span>This took a while to arrive! After the success of the reissue of
Coil&#x27;s Musick To Play In The Dark, it was inevitable that the
second edition would also be reissued. The pre-order opened late
November 2021 and mine arrived in late April this year.






I was toying with the idea of ordering one of the most exclusive editions
direct from DAIS Records, in particular the
glow in the dark one, but with international shipping the cost was pretty high.
I went with a UK distributor
(Boomkat)
instead, who had their own exclusive edition: black-in-purple-in-clear.






I&#x27;m happy with my decision: it&#x27;s one of the most interesting variants I own,
and from what I&#x27;ve read, glow in the dark vinyl never sounds great anyway.
(I think I have at least one glow in the dark 7&quot; single somewhere)
Stand-out track: Tiny Golden Books
Since I didn&#x27;t say so last time, the stand-out track on volume one is Red
Birds Will Fly Out of the East and Destroy Paris in a
Night,
but both volumes are full of really interesting moments (🎵 One day, your eggs
are going to hatch and some very strange birds are going to emerge. 🎵)</span>
