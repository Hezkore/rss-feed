          "description": "On May 7th 2020, Microsoft kicked off the new generation of consoles with a gameplay showcase featuring a wide range of games planned for the Xbox Series X - and Bright Memory: Infinite was the very first game shown off during this presentation. Now, more than two years later - and half a year after the arrival of the PC version - Bright Memory: Infinite has arrived on console. Given its prominent placement in that original showcase, I felt that we needed to check it out here on Digital Foundry. On the face of it, this is indeed a 'next-gen only' exclusive - you can't play the game on PS4 or Xbox One consoles - which makes the launch of a Nintendo Switch version all the more intriguing.\r\n\n\r\nBright Memory: Infinite is a fast-paced first-person shooter which combines snappy gunplay with sword driven melee combat. It's not a long game but what's here is solid and reasonably well executed - it almost recalls the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior, though with more focused, linear level design. Plus, if you're playing on the latest consoles, Bright Memory Infinite promises support for 120Hz output and ray traced reflections, though not simultaneously.\r\n\n\r\nWhere it surprises the most, perhaps, is in its development history. Bright Memory: Infinite is a showpiece title for what modern development tools can offer when in the right hands - you see, most of the development duties on the game were executed by one person. In creating the game, Infinite was built using Unreal Engine 4 with additional support software and Quixel assets to speed up development time. That's not to say this is entirely a solo project - artists, musicians and voice actors were all required to complete the game but considering the quality of the presentation, it's an impressive accomplishment.\r\n \nRead more",

And the greater the interactivity, the more you need to do it.\nThe problem with this is disjointedness: pauses in conversations where there would normally be none, mismatched tone where there wouldn't normally be any. Sometimes it's obvious, sometimes it's not. And however good the performer - and direction and sticking back together - the result is never quite what it's aiming to be: natural. Because it's not.\nSouth of the Circle got me thinking about this again. It's a smallish game that came out on Apple Arcade a couple of years ago and resurfaced on PC and Switch this week, and I'm very glad it did, because it has some of the best performances in a game I have ever witnessed.\n Read more",

          "description": "I spent five minutes with MultiVersus over the weekend, which turned into ten minutes and then an hour and then the best part of a morning. MultiVersus is great! If you aren't aware of it, it's a Warner Bros-themed Smash Bros-alike. You choose from a bunch of familiar characters, and then fight on 2D stages. Your aim is to get ring-outs by lobbing enemies off the screen, and the more damage you do, the further they fly when you hit them. Best of four wins. Simple.\r\n\n\r\nNot simple, obviously, and here's where an admission comes in. I love the idea of Smash Bros - and I particularly adore the way that the games have become sort of Nintendo museums, beautiful virtual dioramas in their own right. But I am thick and slow and these games have always looked fast and complicated. All of these Nintendo characters, some of which I am happy to admit I have not really heard of, fighting it out in astonishingly swift battles.\r\n\n\r\nI think there are two reasons MultiVersus clicked. Three actually, the bonus third being that I was playing alongside my daughter, whose enthusiasm for these things always carries me aloft with it. Anyway, the other two reasons: One, MultiVersus is new, so there's that sense of getting in on the ground floor. Even if people are turning up with Smash Bros experience - and they are, and it's helping them - the psychological toll is lightened, because this is a game that's been around for a few weeks at most.\r\n \nRead more",

Why is it a Snapshot? Dear reader, these are questions for another time. But the general term, at least, has stuck with me as I try to sum up what Fortnite was, and is, and will be. If you'd asked me five years ago today, I'd say it was a distinctly average PVE base building shooter - and the first time Eurogamer ever really covered Fortnite in detail was a preview of this now long-sidelined mode.\r\n\n\r\nIf you'd asked me four years ago, as Fortnite's quickly-thrown-together battle royale was blowing up and footballers were doing its dances in World Cup matches, I'd say it was probably The Next Big Thing. Three years ago? Fortnite was established as a phenomenon, an industry-leading showcase of engine mastery and live service development that could pull off in-game stunts like no other. Want to blow up bits of the map in real-time with a giant volcano? No problem. Stage a giant monster versus mech fight and invite everyone in to see it live? You got it.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "This week marks the very long-awaited arrival of Sea of Thieves' captaincy update, and developer Rare has shared a detailed video breakdown of its new features - including ship owning, naming, and extended customisation - as part of its new Season 7 trailer.\r\n\n\r\nThose who've been with Sea of Thieves for the long haul might recall that captaincy features were originally planned for the game's very first post-release update, back in 2018. A development rethink after a wobbly launch saw those plans put on the back burner, so it was a bit of a surprise when they finally resurfaced some four years later during this year's not-E3.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, with this Thursday's slightly delayed launch almost upon us, we have a much clearer idea of how the update will work, with Rare's new video suggesting at least one of the aims of captaincy is to answer player calls for more to spend their amassed in-game wealth on.\r\n \nRead more",

These have been achieved by adding new flag positions, by placing new areas and assets around the map, and by raising terrain.\r\n\n\r\nDICE says terrain changes will \"break sightlines and let infantry move more purposefully around the map\", while new assets will \"bring more tactical destruction\", giving players new options as the environment evolves throughout a game.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Apex Legends' 14th season, officially known as Hunted, is right around the corner, and Respawn is currently in full-on hype mode ahead of its 9th August arrival. And now, following the official unveiling of new hero Vantage last week, the developer now confirmed a major overhaul for its original Kings Canyon map, alongside a level cap increase for players.\r\n\n\r\nKings Canyon has, of course, been around since Apex Legends' launch back in 2019, and Season 14's extensive overhaul aims to improve some of the ageing map's more troublesome issues. Before we get to the mechanical stuff though, there's perhaps the most immediately obvious change - upgraded lighting and a new skybox, both intended to make for a \"more immersive, vibrant environment\".\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay changes though, there's the new Relic point of interest, which is designed to help create a little bit more breathing space on the map in the early to mid game so squad battles are less likely to be interrupted by third parties. This has been achieved by filling the Skull Town and Thunderdome area sunk in Season 5 with sand and building a new series of winding, interconnected buildings for fresh skirmishes, complete with a giant skull centerpiece. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As much as I love Star Wars and as much as I love virtual reality, I've always been slightly disappointed by Disney's official Star Wars VR offerings.\nIt's not that they're bad, mind. I've had a lot of fun with them, especially EA's Star Wars: Squadrons. My problem is that they always feel like they do the bare minimum when it comes to immersion or run time.\nI think Disney's episodic VR games like the Vader Immortal trilogy are a good example of this. The pitch for that series in particular is great. Use the Force! Shoot blasters! Fight Vader! But, it all comes at the cost of a very slow and plodding adventure that has the pacing speed of a Bantha. When they work, they work. But most of the time they feel like bite sized adventures that were built to pass the time in a queue for a ride at Galaxy's Edge, rather than be an epic space adventure in their own right.\n Read more",

          "description": "Best Month Ever! is such a (seemingly) unusual game that I didn't know what to make of it after seeing the original trailer, or even after checking out the demo. It's about a white woman named Louise, set in the US during 1969, where she must spend as much time as possible with her Black, biracial son Mitch. This is because Louise has been diagnosed with an illness and has only one month left to live.\r\n\n\r\nThe story is told in flashbacks with a voiceover from an adult Mitch, contextualising the choices and decisions made by his mother at the time. Of course, these are choices you end up making through dialogue options throughout the game, creating a Louise whose future characteristics are based on Mitch's observation of your behaviour.\r\n\n\r\nIt begins with Louise having to collect her final paycheck from her abusive boss at the nearby diner, with Mitch (supposedly) sitting in the car. Through his eyes, you observe Louise being sexually harassed and make a quick getaway after torching up the boss' car with an old lighter.\r\n \nRead more",

We've looked at the beginnings of the full HD dream from Sony's initial marketing claims, through to the late 2006 launch. We've seen triumph and disaster, along with a gradual metamorphosis, with 1080p coming into its own on smaller scale projects with less advanced visuals - punctuated by the arrival of stereoscopic 3D, requiring higher pixel counts, providing a backdoor to further 1080p support for the 'Triple'. In this final chapter, we cover the years 2013 to 2015 - a period of transition as the difficult PS3 era yields to the juggernaut success of PlayStation 4. \n2013 proves to be an intriguing year for 1080p…",

          "description": "In the house where I grew up, I shared a room with two older brothers. I was a nosy kid, and I have a lot of happy memories of looking through my brothers' books and whatnot while they weren't around. One day - this is decades back; I can at least remember that it was sunny - I found a paperback that my brother Paul had picked up somewhere. Paul liked science-fiction This was sci-fi. It was by Harry Harrison, and it was one of his Stainless Steel Rat novels.\r\n\n\r\nActually, it was a very special one, an odd one. But we'll get to that in a second. Harry Harrison was a big deal in 20th century sci-fi, a writer who moved from illustrating comics to turning out novels that existed in the raggedy edge-lands between parodying space operas and reveling in their excesses. However he handled things, he always brought an anti-war message that was sometimes hidden, given the rather conservative genre he worked within. Outside of the Stainless Steel Rat books - the Rat is a charming con-man and occasional hero - he's probably best known for writing the novel that Soylent Green was loosely based upon.\r\n\n\r\nSo yes, the book of Paul's I'd found was a bit of an oddity amongst Harrison's output. It was a game book. You Can Be The Stainless Steel Rat was published in 1985, according to my lovely  eBay copy, battered but still with a bit of gloss on the cover. 1985! This means it hit right in the middle of the Choose Your Own Adventure craze, and it cleaves tight to many of the genre's standards, like numbered sections that come with choices at the end. As a reader, you ping back and forth through the book following your instincts, and probably keeping a finger or two marking previous choices for the moments in which your instincts fail.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I was 38 years old when I realised I was a bard. I shouldn't really have been surprised - I was Danny Zuko in my high school production of Grease after all, and then I was Frank n' Furter in stockings and suspenders. But the realisation vexed me, because until that point I'd never had much time for bards. They were, as far as I was concerned - and I can barely bring myself to write it now - padding. Oh the hollowness! Oh the shame! How could I ever have been so empty? Yet, perhaps the fault was not entirely my own.\nYou see, I grew up on bards as interpreted by computer games, and to me, there, they were a forgettable class. They were there only to serve others. In Dark Age of Camelot, which I spent a long time playing, the bard-likes were the speed buff your group needed to get around quickly - that was their purpose. They could do a few other things but none as well as the other classes could. And in World of Warcraft, another game I put a lot of time into, bards weren't a playable class at all.\nLook across RPGs and it's a similar story. There's no bard class in the Divinity: Original Sin series, and in Dragon Age, the whole series, the bard only crops up as playable in Origins as a rogue subclass. Those series couldn't be more heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons and yet, the poor old bard doesn't get a look-in. And it leaves you wondering why. Or, it reinforces a belief somewhere in your head that bards aren't good enough to make the cut.\n Read more",

Unfortunately, supply chain issues forced Valve to delay initial shipments from the end of 2021 into this year, with further rollouts perhaps not as rapid as Valve would have liked.\r\n\n\r\nWe've had plenty of updates since then - Valve said it would be ramping up production into \"the hundreds of thousands\" in March, while June saw it announce shipments would more than double in the coming months - and the latest brings great news for those that already have Steam Deck reservations.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Shortly after Nintendo released the first wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC in March, data miners uncovered what appeared to be a near-complete list of platforms each new wave would be pulling tracks from - and the recent arrival of Wave 2 appears to validate that leak, giving fans a solid foundation for the giddy speculation of classic tracks still to come.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing Wave 1's release, data miner Fishguy6564 shared a video of Mario Kart 8's track selection screen with the Booster Course Pass' ten remaining cups unlocked, complete with the platform origin of each included track. The then-unreleased Wave 2's Turnip Cup, for instance, was shown to contain four tracks taken from Mario Kart Tour, SNES, N64, and DS, while Propeller Cup listed tracks from Tour, GBA, Wii, and a final, yet to be defined course.\r\n\n\r\nWe now know, following Wave 2's release this week, that those leaked platforms line up perfectly with Mario Kart 8's newly expanded track roster. The final track listing for the Turnip Cup is New York Minute (Mario Kart Tour), Mario Cart Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalimari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS), while the Propeller Cup brings Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and Sky-High Sundae (Tour). Notably, the latter is debuting as part of the Booster Pack but coming to Tour later, which might explain its absent tag in the leak.\r\n \nRead more",

Axios' Stephen Totilo has since added a little more detail to those claims, citing his own source as saying Rockstar had earlier planned to have four protagonists in GTA 6, with the action unfolding across three cities.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Seven months after launch, Halo Infinite continues to evolve with 343 Industries embarking on an extended beta testing period for campaign co-op. This is a crucial feature for a Halo title, desperately missed on the game's debut - and clearly a challenge for the developer. After all, Halo has transitioned from a linear shooter into an open world experience, with a vast degree of freedom for the player - and the notion that up to four players can travel the map doing whatever they please wouldn't really make sense. 343's solutions are constrictive - but they do work - and overall impressions are favourable. \r\n\n\r\nFirst impressions suggest a co-op experience close in nature to those that have gone before - but only because of the nature of the opening brace of campaign chapters. These are entirely linear in nature and 343's strategy in keeping players together is simple: there are certain 'points of no return' - such as passing a door that permanently closes behind you, or kicking off a new cutscene, that reset the positioning for all players. With that in mind, I never felt that the game was artificially keeping us closer together, it felt like a classic Halo co-op experience. \r\n\n\r\nObviously, this changes in the open world simply because it has to, with 343 setting up what it calls an Area of Operation - or AOO. This is roughly defined as a maximum distance of 300 metres between players, with warnings starting to kick in at around the 250m metre mark. Once too far apart, the player furthest away from the next objective is auto-killed, spawning closer to his counterpart. The end result is that freedom is curtailed, but the fireteam is kept together, essentially forcing a focus on the next target. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is old, clunky and boring, but at the same time I am entranced by it. This is history I'm playing; the game is 18 years old. There's nothing you can do short of remaking it that's going to make it feel young and exciting again - and Wizards of the Coast tried that last year with Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, and look how that turned out (clue: not well). So all those lumps and bumps I feel while playing it - all those things that have been smoothed by the many waves of action role-playing games since - I don't mind them. In fact, I love them, because they're what revisiting Dark Alliance 2 is all about.\nQuick history lesson: Dark Alliance was an experiment, really, in bringing Dungeons & Dragons to console. Interplay didn't want a slower, wordy adventure like BioWare's Baldur's Gate but something more suited to a console audience - something faster, something more action-packed. So it enlisted Snowblind Studios (which would go on to make something of a spiritual successor in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North - remember that? We gave it 4/10) to make one. There was reticence but when BG Dark Alliance came out in 2001, it was surprisingly well received, so a sequel was greenlit.\nThis time, however, the beloved Black Isle Studios would make it. This was the house of Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and Fallout, a bonafide RPG legend, and its involvement added a layer of intrigue and excitement to the game. But Dark Alliance 2 would also be the last game Black Isle would release, with Interplay closing the studio and laying off all of the staff months before release, and cancelling a Dark Alliance 3 in the process. People from Black Isle would go on to form new studio Obsidian Entertainment thereafter. So there's all this history wrapped up in the game.\n Read more",

More than anything, it's unpredictable: whenever you go into GTA Online, you always come out with some kind of story.\r\n\n\r\nLast night Sarah was busy, so I fired it up alone.

          "description": "NBA 2K23 is nearly with us, releasing September 9 this year. In the build up to launch, we’ve learnt a lot about the gameplay changes coming to the hugely popular basketball game. This includes improvements to shooting, dribbling, and blocking with new gesture combos, AI improvements, accessibility features and more.\nWe’ve broken down each major change coming with the latest release from 2K, so if you want to hit the court running, check out each major gameplay change coming to NBA 2K23 below!\nFirst, there’s the pro stick and a vast selection of new gesture combos coming to it. Players have been able to flick or hold the stick to do more complex shots since 2K21, but with this entry, a new selection of options are coming for dexterous players. Speaking of shots, skill dunks were a tad too strong last year, so that’s been touched up to be more complex. This includes a physics-based rim hanging system.\n Read more",

For video games, this means debates constantly encircle the topics of price opposed to content and the need versus greed of rereleasing older games on newer hardware. \r\n\nA prime example of these debates comes with this September's The Last Of Us, Part 1. A remake/remaster (I’m honestly not sure what to call it) of a game from 2013, this PS5 title will keep the core gameplay of the original, whilst improving the visuals, animations and AI, and add new DualSense capabilities, accessibility features and a slew of bonuses.\nThe inherent value of The Last Of Us, Part 1 comes down to each purchaser's differing context. Some may have never played it before, be that because of a lack of accessibility options or access to hardware, whilst others may just want to jump back into one of their favourite games with some improvements. If this was a new version of Dark Souls, I’m sure I’d eat it up, even if I thought it was overpriced.\n Read more",

These days, the practice of travelling for competition is more common with sponsorships, social media, and official systems like the Tekken World Tour boosting the profile of excellent venues run by a passionate few. Now more than ever, your own scene can test its might against the Earth's best. For a single weekend, the world can come to you. \nExcept this experience may be in jeopardy for Tekken 7 players this year. The Tekken World Tour – an official Bandai Namco tournament circuit that in the past has done nothing but boost the prestige of global communities – may have undone this momentum with a handful of significant changes to its rules. With professional players, tournament organizers, and spectators alike puzzled by these adjustments, what are the repercussions of these changes for the worldwide Tekken scene?  \n Read more",

A junior animator at Playtonic Games, he started a side project creating a character concept for Daffy Duck at the tail end of July. From there, clips of combos, aerials, and special moves all inspired by classic moments from the lovable duck were quickly published online, gaining traction among the community.\nThis excellent animation work in turn inspired some more creative juices to get flowing.

This may not come as a massive shock to fans of other Riot Games projects, but in the AAA fighting game scene this is a massive leap. In addition, it was revealed that the mystical bruiser Illaoi will also be joining the base roster of the game, as elaborated in a dedicated blog post.\nThe video also gives a brief update on the current state of development for the game. The core gameplay development is finished, leaving character development, competitive or social features. Also, while microtransactions will be present Tom stated: We operate with one approach - if we don’t like it, we won’t do it. When it comes to monetization we promise to be respectful of your time and your wallet”.\nAs it stands right now, there aren’t many big budget fighting games out there that have taken the leap into a free-to-play model. MultiVersus is the largest and most recent example and while it may have shot to the moon with 100,000 concurrent PC players on launch, it’s impossible to gauge what portion of that success comes from the free cost of entry or the colourful cast. Nonetheless, not having to pay to play is a massive boon for the title’s accessibility.\n Read more",

A race of maintenance robots that have evolved individuality and self-awareness after the death of their creators doesn’t seem completely outside the realm of possibility. What completely obliterates the willing suspension of disbelief is the ridiculous idea that a cat would ever help anybody.  \r\n\nHave you ever heard of a bomb-sniffing cat? Seen anyone with a guide cat? Of course you haven’t. Yet Stray is a story about a cat that not only actively helps everyone it meets, but follows direct instructions. This can no longer be accurately described as Science Fiction, make no mistake – Stray is a work of High Fantasy. \nStray depicts the journey of an ugly orange cat wandering through a robot-populated, quarantined city, inexplicably bringing happiness everywhere it goes. Every robot that meets it can’t help but beam at it, gigantic cutesy emojis flashing on their television faces. Absolutely everyone is delighted to meet it, melting whenever the horrid thing brushes up against them. Stray is quite simply a work of feline propaganda, creating a deeply unbelievable world where even the very notion of vague indifference towards the animal has been excised.  \n Read more",

According to senior game designer Eric Canavese: “We are actively working on gifting to other players right now, but we want to make sure it’s something people enjoy, something that doesn’t feel grindy”.\nOn Cross Progression, Evan stated: “We’re actively working on cross progression, but there’s no release date on it. The game wasn’t built with it in mind, which makes it complicated. But I hear you, and I want cross progression too. It’s something we’re definitely working on – we want it sooner than later.”\n Read more",

It’s clear most of the games that would easily end up on this list have been pushed back to 2023. That said, between the precious few that (so far) are sticking to their 2022 guns, and the couple of your under-the-radar, sleeper hit contenders still to come, this year won’t actually end up being that dire when all is said and done.\nAs mentioned in the first part, this is obviously not an objective list; it only reflects my own picks.

We know that Warner Bros, Arc System Works, Capcom, SNK, and Bandai Namco will be present.\nSo, what is actually going to be shown off? While we don’t know for sure, recent events as well as the current fighting game landscape can help us make some educated guesses. The most obvious of which is Street Fighter 6, which was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation showcase. With only five of the cast revealed (not via leaks), it’s likely that at least one new character will be shown at the show.\n Read more",

I suspect there'll no doubt be a very long line of future character mods to come, but if I say so myself, this feels like the best and most-fitting so far (aside from people modding their own pets into the game!).\nModder, MrMarco1003, has plucked Spyro from the Reignited Trilogy and popped them into Stray.

The below shot is definitely a perfect example of how passionate the Wii Fit trainers can get about a fight.\nThat said, the playful tradition is set to come to an end.

The most crucial for players is an average input lag delay of 31.47 milliseconds on the PS5, which is less than two frames of delay at 60 FPS.\nOkay, so what does this actually mean? Well, in the simplest terms, it means that when you press a button on the PS5 while mashing away at MultiVersus, your move comes out fast. Hella fast, actually.

This clip surged in popularity when it was shared by video game hacker Lance McDonald, leading many to question how it was possible. The answer? It was all essentially a PR stunt from three modders unveiling some impressive new tools.\nThe reason why it was such a mystery is that Nier's modding community couldn't find any of the files in any version of the game. When Nier Automata producer Yosuke Saito and director Yoko Taro both tweeted about the mod, but didn't clear anything up, some believed it could be some kind of marketing move for the upcoming Switch port (which is probably going to be the best way to play the game's side quests).\n Read more",

Resident Evil was a very popular one, and it seems like developer Behaviour Interactive has plans to continue working with Capcom, as more characters from the series have leaked online.\nThe leaks come from the reliable DBDLeaks Twitter account, which recently showed off the models and outfits of Albert Wesker, the new killer, and Ada Wong and Rebecca Chambers as playable survivors. They all have their classic looks, which will likely please fans of the characters.\n Read more",

Earlier this week (July 27), Raven Software shared the patch notes for season four of the battle royale which showed an upcoming skin of a Samoyed for operator Kim Tae Young. \nHowever, Lin took to Twitter to point out just how similar this upcoming skin looks to a piece of their work that they shared to ArtStation in 2019.

For Xenoblade Chronicles 3, that comes in the form of the world being essentially five times bigger than the previous entry, at least according to one of the game's directors, Koh Kojima.\nNintendo recently shared an interview with three of the lead developers of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, including Kojima, fellow director Genki Yokota, and writer Tetsuya Takahashi.

It was a dour, joyless slog that had no idea how to actually engage with any of the themes or ideas raised by its near future Big Tech Dystopia setting. The protagonist – Aiden Dogs – instantly became the poster boy for bland, uninspired leading men in videogames.\nThe whole thing reeked of a design by committee obligation created solely to hype the potential of the upcoming PS4 and Xbox One, one of those swanky trailers for a launch title that’s destined to be quietly cancelled and forgotten about – but this one, inexplicably, made it to release somehow. That really should have been the end of Watch Dogs, and for many of you it probably was. \r\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a game that had fewer expectations than Watch Dogs 2. It seemed like a mistake at first, something Ubisoft had pencilled into their schedule under the assumption that the first game was going to be a smash hit. Lack of corporate oversight coupled with absolutely zero anticipation probably goes some way to explaining how it ended up being one of the greatest open-world videogames ever made.  \n Read more",

For one, we see her pull down a visor over her right eye, identifying incoming enemies which fits in well with her scout / sniper archetype.

          "description": "Stray is the first game from French developer, BlueTwelve, and ultimately, it’s an incredibly impressive feat from the team. Not only did Stray claw its way to the top of Steam wishlists the day prior to release, but at the time of writing, it currently sits at the top of Steam’s best of 2022, even surpassing God of War.\nIn the words of The Aristocats, everybody wants to be a cat, or so it seems. However, while Stray’s four-legged feline is at the forefront of the game, I raise the argument that it is not the Outsider that makes Stray wonderful. Jumping around as elegantly as a cat would, and causing as much destruction and chaos as one would too, is just part of the fun here. On the whole, Stray's hook is the story of hope and friendship at the center of the experience – I’d argue it's that which has really brought people together, especially given the tumultuous times that we’re currently living in. I should also warn, if you’re yet to finish Stray, there are spoilers ahead.\nOf course, pet owners are rejoicing in the fact that there’s a game for them. I’m not even a pet owner (right now), and this game made me itch to get a cat again like never before. However, I don’t think it is the cat themselves that stirs up this feeling within me. Instead, it’s how this cat touches the lives of everyone around them, including players of the game.\n Read more",

The bug appears to be aging players' characters at an alarming rate.\nIf, like me, you can't stand to look after toddlers in The Sims 4, this isn't terrible news. However, the bug is not just affecting toddlers. Simply put, no sim is safe.\nFirst reported by PCGamer, it appears that this bug is causing sims to grow from toddlers to seniors in just a matter of minutes. The Sims Community website, however, has reported that the issue is primarily affecting those who are using 'short' and 'long' life spans in the game. \n Read more",

Despite some first party bangers – Returnal, I'm looking at you – so far, Sony’s machine’s got off to less of a running start and more of an agonising crawl. It’s a problem that Microsoft’s new boxes aren’t immune to either, but cunningly, Xbox has pulled a rabbit out of a hat. The name of its new floppy-eared friend? Game Pass. While Microsoft has been quietly collecting studios and Sony releases a steady stream of exclusives, by Year Two, there’s one clear winner of this console generation: Game Pass.\r\n\nBoasting over 25 million subscribers and winning over the hearts and minds of value-loving gamers, the slow-build service has been genuinely disruptive to the video games industry. It’s seen this console generation defined less by ‘next gen’ release and more by a shiny new way to consume them. WIth fan twitter accounts happily parroting Xbox’s ‘best deal in gaming’ and fanboyism now gleefully extending to subscription services, it seemed the battle lines for this generation have already been drawn. It was inevitable then, that Sony would throw itself into the subscription service skirmish. It's chosen battle-ready champion? An all-new, three-tiered PS Plus offering. \nRolling out worldwide last month, in these early days, it’s hardly been the valiant comeback Sony hoped for. Following months of leaked information, PS Plus’s 2.0 ‘grand’ reveal was fired out with… well, less of a bang and more an inaudible whimper. Light on PS1 and PS2 classics and looking from a distance like Poundland Game Pass, Sony’s initial offering reeked of a quick money grab. A poorly copied scrap of ‘subscription service 101’ homework. Yet, it turns out, the reality is far from the disaster it seems.\n Read more",

The Wii’s digital store was discontinued 3 years ago now. It still sucks, of course – but it’s just a sort of fact of life.\r\n\nSo, the facts right now are that as of the end of August, you’ll no longer be able to add funds to Wii U and 3DS eShop accounts.

That sounds like a lot – and, indeed it is! – but when it comes to mobile games, it still pales in comparison to Pokemon Go, which hit the $100m mark in just 14 days.

          "description": "You know those beloved novels you always mean to read, but never quite get around to? Ico is my gaming equivalent. Released in 2001 for Sony’s bulky behemoth, this PS2 classic is heralded as one of the medium’s greatest achievements. If that wasn’t enough of an excuse for a games journalist to just fucking play it already, it’s also part of a trilogy that I utterly adore. Falling head over heels for creator Fumito Ueda’s feverishly anticipated 2016 epic The Last Guardian (remember thinking this would never release?) and most gamers’ first encounter with Ueda (seminal goliath slayer, Shadow Of The Colossus), Ico’s alluring box art has always beckoned. Now, with the PS2 classic available to stream via PS Plus Extra, it was finally time to see what the fuss is all about.\r\n\nEntirely predictably then, Ico hooks me immediately. When it comes to the navel-gazing ‘games as art’ discourse, there’s a reason that Ico is always highlighted as a shining example. Light on narrative and heavy on ambience, Fumito Ueda’s breakthrough project is a majestic mood piece – a universally relatable adventure that largely avoids cutscenes and, instead, relies on its setting to tell its tale. \nAnd what a setting. There’s a wonderfully surrealist quality to Ueda’s debut that immediately recalls the ill-fitting, ethereal nature of childhood dreams. Thanks to the PS3’s notoriously difficult-to-emulate cell processor, Ico is only available to stream via Sony’s rebranded PS Now service, giving it an unintentionally murky look. Still, it’s hard to care when the core art style is this good. At times, Ico’s odd camera angles and surrealist pacing make the whole thing feel like a playable Renaissance painting; amping up that dreamlike feel which defies Ico’s dated visuals, oozing a quietly entrancing sense of mystique and dread.\r\n \nRead more",

Many will know that NBA star Lebron James was added to the cast upon the open beta release, but Rick & Morty are also set to join the roster during the upcoming season one period.

          "description": "The free-to-play game scene is booming right now. There’s Apex Legends, Final Fantasy 14, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Warframe – and so, so many more besides. But getting to the front of the pack is hard: there’s an ever-increasing number of competitors, and what was once the domain of experimental up-and-comers is now the killing floor for triple-A developers. Yes, indies can make a name for themselves in the space, but the established studios rule the roost now: it’s hard to be a small fish in a big pond when sharks like Epic, EA, Ubisoft and Bungie are milling about. \r\n\nThe newest addition to this proverbial feeding frenzy? Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. Teaming up with relatively unknown studio Player First Games (seriously, the outfit doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page at the time of writing), Warner Bros. has wrestled into the free-to-play market in a meaningful way with MultiVersus – a free-to-play crossover fighting game that has pilfered characters from across the expansive Warner Bros. Discovery catalog. If you don’t know the game, it’s like Smash Bros. Except it’s not.\nLike Smash, you can select a character from any one of some myriad properties. Instead of Nintendo, though, the roster is picked and chosen from licenses from Warner Bros., DC Comics, HBO, Turner Entertainment, and Cartoon Network. So, you can have characters from Scooby-Doo teabagging Steven Universe, or maybe you’ll see Harley Quinn smash a Game of Thrones character around the face. There’s also an original character, Reindog (half reindeer, half dog), who may quietly be the best character in the game. But don’t tell anyone. \n Read more",

For example, the chapter 'The Slums' is actually named 'Home: Slums Part One' in the deciphered language.\nThe same can be said for Sheet Music too. Across The Slums, there are eight pieces of Sheet Music to deliver to Morusque in exchange for a pretty cute badge.

          "description": "For me, probably the most refreshing thing about modern Nintendo is its full-force embracing of the role-playing genre. No series represents this recently-adjusted stance more than Xenoblade – and its latest entry, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, proves that Nintendo’s recent interest and dedication to the genre is paying off dividends.\r\n\nIn many ways, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the culmination of everything developer Monolith Soft has done up to this point. Anybody can appreciate the game – it’s simply a good one. But truly understanding the depth of appreciation it deserves is likely tied to understanding the history of the developer, from when its founders broke free of Square after finding them too obsessed with Final Fantasy over new ideas, through to its days with Bandai Namco, and finally its time as a subsidiary of Nintendo. Here, the developer works on both original games and as a support studio for more widely popular Nintendo titles. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the natural conclusion of all of those events – and it’s wonderful.\nThis third mainline Xenoblade title is as feature-rich as all of its predecessors, if not more so. As a result, I could easily spend many words talking about the mechanics of the game – but it’ll probably suffice to say that it’s an interesting and engaging action RPG combat system that features familiar elements from Xenoblade 1, 2, and X alike. At first blush, it’s most similar to the second game, however. And that’s no bad thing. That game ruled – with the odd caveat – and so too does this sequel.\n Read more",

What does that mean? The game is probably coming to PC, and it will be playable on Steam Deck (thanks, Resetera).\n Read more",

What better way to make your mind up on the title than to head down to London and try it out yourself.\nSonic Frontiers is the first every fully open world Sonic game, allowing players to dash freely between different locations in the overworld rather than having them progress through a series of levels. While 3D Sonic games have allowed those in control to explore a range of vast areas (looking at you, Sonic 06), this pushes that experience to a vaster extent.\nAs for EGX, it’s set to start September 22 - 25 at the ExCeL centre in London. If you want to figure out what all the noise is about surrounding this game, this is a great opportunity to get your hands on it yourself. It’s also the first time the public will have a chance to test it out, so Sonic megafans eager to be among the first to control Sonic on his new adventure have ample reason to go.\n Read more",

So far any collaborations Fall Guys has had with other properties has been relegated to cosmetic, but recently fans have spotted what appears to be an entire Sonic-themed stage coming to the game. \nThe screenshot of the Sonic stage was included in the 'next up' screen, most likely as a mistake, but obviously this had fans wondering what this meant. And now, dataminer FGPancake has managed to find the actual stage in the game, as well as load it in and play around in it.\n Read more",

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life.

I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants.

          "description": "Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. \nTo get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!\nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's the best way to describe it.\"\nOriginally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce \"Incantamentum\" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. \"I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it',\" Gilbert tells me. \"And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'\" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.\nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

Currently Dell has a special on the T150 tower server (the latest replacement for the T110II) which has a G6405T CPU that isn’t even twice as fast as the i3-3220 (3746 vs 2219) in the T110II according to passmark.com (AKA cpubenchmark.net). The special price is $2600.

Based on it appearing to require patching of the system firmware image, they hypothesise that it's propagated by manually dumping the contents of the system flash, modifying it, and then reflashing it back to the board. This probably requires physical access to the board, so it's not especially terrifying - if you're in a situation where someone's sufficiently enthusiastic about targeting you that they're reflashing your computer by hand, it's likely that you're going to have a bad time regardless.\nBut let's think about why this is in the firmware at all.

They are about Akvorado, a\nnetwork flow collector and visualizer, and notably on how it relies on\nClickHouse, a column-oriented database.\nSlides in PDF format\n\nThe meetup was recorded and available on YouTube. Here is the part\nrelevant to my presentation, with subtitles:1\n\n\nI got a few questions about how to get information from the higher\nlayers, like HTTP. As my use case for Akvorado was at the network\nedge, my answers were mostly negative. However, as sFlow is\nextensible, when collecting flows from Linux servers instead, you\ncould embed additional data and they could be exported as well.\nI also got a question about doing aggregation in a single table.\nClickHouse can aggregate automatically data using TTL. My answer for\nnot doing that is partial. There is another reason: the retention\nperiods of the various tables may overlap. For example, the main table\nkeeps data for 15 days, but even in these 15 days, if I do a query on\na 12-hour window, it is faster to use the flows_1m0s aggregated\ntable, unless I request something about ports and IP addresses.\nTo generate the subtitles, I have used Amazon\nTranscribe, the speech-to-text solution from Amazon AWS.\nUnfortunately, there is no en-FR language available, which would\nhave been useful for my terrible accent. While the\nsubtitles were 100% accurate when the host, Robert Hodge from\nAltinity, was speaking, the success rate on my talk was quite\nlower. I had to rewrite almost all sentences. However, using\nspeech-to-text is still useful to get the timings, as it is also\nsomething requiring a lot of work to do manually. ↩︎",

HDMI KVM switches start at $150 and I didn’t feel like buying one. So I wrote a script to change inputs on my monitor. The following script locks the session on the local machine and switches the monitor’s input to the other machine. I ran the command “ddcutil  vcpinfo| grep Input” which shows that (on my monitor at least) 60 is the VCP for input. Then I ran the command “ddcutil getvcp 60” to get the current value and tried setting values sequentially to find the value for the other port.\nBelow is the script I’m using on one system, the other is the same but setting the different port via setvcp. The loginctl command is to lock the screen to prevent accidental keyboard or mouse input from messing anything up.\n# lock the session, assumes that seat0 is the only session\nloginctl lock-session $(loginctl list-sessions|grep \"seat0 *$\"|cut -c1-7)\n# 0xf is DisplayPort, 0x11 is HDMI-1\nddcutil setvcp 60 0x11\nFor keyboard, mouse, and speakers I’m using a USB 2.0 hub that I can switch between computers. I idly considered getting a three-pole double-throw switch (four pole switches aren’t available at my local electronic store) to switch USB 2.0 as I only need to switch 3 of the 4 wires. But for the moment just plugging the hub into different systems is enough, I only do that a couple of times a day.\nRelated posts:\n\nSwitches and Cables  I’ve just read an amusing series of blog posts about...\nLoad Average Monitoring  For my ETBE-Mon [1] monitoring system I recently added a...\nhow to run dynamic ssh tunnels  service smtps { disable = no socket_type = stream wait...",

          "description": "Recently I've been working with simple/trivial scripting languages, and I guess I finally reached a point where I thought \"Lisp?  Why not\".  One of the reasons for recent experimentation was thinking about the kind of minimalism that makes implementing a language less work - being able to actually use the language to write itself.\nFORTH is my recurring example, because implementing it mostly means writing a virtual machine which consists of memory (\"cells\") along with a pair of stacks, and some primitives for operating upon them.   Once you have that groundwork in place you can layer the higher-level constructs (such as \"for\", \"if\", etc).\nLisp allows a similar approach, albeit with slightly fewer low-level details required, and far less tortuous thinking.  Lisp always feels higher-level to…",

This release continues with the six-months cycle started with release 1.0.5 in July 2020.

          "description": "I finally managed to get hold of a Thinkpad Z13 to examine a functional implementation of Microsoft's Pluton security co-processor. Trying to boot Linux from a USB stick failed out of the box for no obvious reason, but after further examination the cause became clear - the firmware defaults to not trusting bootloaders or drivers signed with the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA key. This means that given the default firmware configuration, nothing other than Windows will boot. It also means that you won't be able to boot from any third-party external peripherals that are plugged in via Thunderbolt.\nThere's no security benefit to this. If you want security here you're paying attention to the values measured into the TPM, and thanks to Microsoft's own specification for measurements made into PCR 7, switching from booting Windows to booting something signed with the 3rd party signing key will change the measurements and invalidate any sealed secrets. It's trivial to detect this. Distrusting the 3rd party CA by default doesn't improve security, it just makes it harder for users to boot alternative operating systems.\nLenovo, this isn't OK. The entire architecture of UEFI secure boot is that it allows for security without compromising user choice of OS. Restricting boot to Windows by default provides no security benefit but makes it harder for people to run the OS they want to. Please fix it.\n comments",
