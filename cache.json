          "description": "It's been a hot topic of late about when a classic game is ripe for a remake, but given how Resident Evil 4 seems to have been rolled out for re-release in one shape or another almost annually since it first appeared in 2005 it feels like a special case. There was a waggle-enhanced Wii version, HD versions for the Xbox 360 and PS3, mobile versions for Android and iOS and VR versions for Oculus Quest - by this point, Capcom's iconic survival horror feels as ubiquitous as Skyrim. \r\n\n\r\nWhen Capcom announced it was giving Resident Evil 4 the same remake treatment it gave RE2 and RE3 recently, eyebrows were understandably raised. What exactly can a remake bring to make it worth playing through again? Going hands-on with a short section of the forthcoming remake showed there's a fair amount to make it more than worthwhile, and this remake provides an effective remix of some moments we know inside out, refreshing them enough to make it feel like you're playing through this classic for the first time. \r\n\n\r\nBefore we get to that, though, there's obviously a fairly hefty visual makeover in effect here. The original Resident Evil 4 has aged admirably and still looks pretty fine today, but it doesn't look quite like this. In keeping with other games that have excellently employed Capcom's RE Engine, this is a proper looker with moody lighting and an incredible *wetness* to the gore. There are some truly disturbing sights here, from fresh corpses of recently ripped apart rabbits to the enhanced horror of seeing a villager tied to the stake in astounding new detail. Perhaps most importantly, there's an extra floppiness to Leon's curtains, and an extra fluffiness to the collar of his famous jacket. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Capcom has given perhaps the best look yet at its highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake - and shared a little more on its various other Resident Evil projects - in its latest video showcase, with the remake getting both new gameplay footage and a new story trailer.\r\n\n\r\nOn the gameplay front, Capcom shared an action-packed couple of minutes of its RE4 remake, starting with a sequence from early in the game that sees protagonist Leon skulking through the woods before stumbling across a seemingly abandoned barn. It's a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake's various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.\r\n\n\r\nFollowing its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to \"[pay] respect to original game's world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title\". This, it say, \"will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy\".\r\n \nRead more",

Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas' moon - but developer Respawn's latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst's Apex Games debut.\r\n\n\r\nThere's a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15's previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Saturnalia - the striking new survival horror from acclaimed studio Santa Ragione - is free on the Epic Games Store next week, alongside Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.\r\n\n\r\nSanta Ragione, if you're unfamiliar, previously released the celebrated likes of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, but Saturnalia - which is heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - looks to be its most ambitious title yet, trapping players in an ancient village steeped in murky rituals and challenging them to uncover its many secrets.\r\n\n\r\nAlthough a solo experience, players take control of four different characters as they investigate the village's labyrinthine, and decidedly psychedelic, streets. If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.\r\n \nRead more",

Team Blue's 13th-gen chips arrive today, and on paper they represent a huge upgrade over 12th-gen despite compatibility with existing Z690 (and new Z790) boards. You get higher clock speeds (up to 5.8GHz!), more efficiency cores, more L3 cache and higher power targets - all of which you'd charitably expect to contribute to a significant uptick in gaming and content creation performance.  \nTo discover if these processors live up to the hype, we've been testing the $589 Core i9 13900K and $319 Core i5 13600K in gaming and content creation benchmarks since last week. Our plan going in was simple: to find out exactly how much better these 13th-gen models are than their 12th-gen predecessors, as well as how they measure up to AMD's new Ryzen 7000 and popular Ryzen 5000 alternatives - including the excellent Ryzen 7 5800X3D. \nAs with our Ryzen 7000 testing, we've opted to check two RAM configurations for each new processor: DDR5-5200, representing 'budget' DDR5, and DDR5-6000, the AMD-identified sweet spot for price versus performance. We've also done some more in-depth RAM testing on page five, showing the maximum gains you can expect to see from opting for specialist high-speed RAM over more pedestrian models. \n Read more",

          "description": "If you're like me, you live for the moment in a certain type of film where the mysterious figure in the drawing room says something arch, and then presses a concealed switch. At which point there is a rumbling, or perhaps just a dignified electrical hum. And then behold! Behind the mysterious figure, the fire place, or a large oil painting, or a promising section of bookshelving, will revolve or slide away to reveal a concealed door.\r\n\n\r\nI love a concealed door. I absolutely cannot get enough of them. Not just for the theatre of the opening mechanism, the gasp as an unexpected vista is created, but for the kinds of movies and literature that require concealed doors and the people who own them. And testify: this is one of the ways that Gotham Knights has made me pretty happy. For all its sins, for its shortcomings, low frame rates on consoles, bland open-world stuff and predictable plotting, for all of that, during the middle act it is absolutely the high water mark for concealed doors in video games. Nobody else can touch it. Barely a scene goes by in which a hidden switch is not discovered or a series of piano keys pressed, to send an oil painting through the floor or a see a section of Spanish tile transforming itself into a staircase leading down into the earth.\r\n\n\r\nWhat is all this sweet work worth? Gotham Knights has disappointed a lot of people prior to its release by being a Batman game without Batman in it. Batman's dead, baby! He doesn't make it through the opening cut-scene. What's the fun of a Batman game without Batman, in which you get to pick between the remaining elements of the Bat-family for your kicks? The fun, I had hoped, lay with the fact that if Gotham Knights can't be a Batman story, it can at least be a Court of Owls story.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "\"At the beginning it was a little bit complicated, I'm not gonna lie,\" Patrick Klaus, general manager of Motive Studio tells me. We're talking via Zoom following another public briefing from his team on its upcoming Dead Space remake, Motive's eagerly-anticipated revival of the space-set survival horror series which is due out on 27th January. But the purpose of our chat is far broader than Dead Space - taking in Motive's past and looking to its future, where a massive new Iron Man - the studio's most ambitious project yet by far - now sits on the horizon.\r\n\n\r\nUntil recently, Motive feels like it has flown under the radar. Founded in 2015 as EA's new Montreal home for former Assassin's Creed co-creator Jade Raymond, it took five years for the studio to ship its first game: the generally well-regarded Star Wars Squadrons. By this point, Raymond had already been gone two years - poached by Google to work on the ill-fated Stadia. Meanwhile, an ambitious new IP the studio had been trying to build - shown publicly in 2020 by EA via a brief snippet of concept footage - was still struggling to find direction. \r\n\n\r\n\"My predecessor had left and it was still a young studio that hadn't shipped,\" Klaus says of Motive, when he joined to replace Raymond in 2019. \"Motive had contributed to Battlefront 2's campaign but was a really young studio, and I would say the first couple of years really have been [about us] searching for our identity and our purpose, like some of those other more established studios.\" Motive isn't yet a household name in the way other EA teams like BioWare or Criterion might be, Klaus agrees - but that, he hopes, will change.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "House of the Dragon and Dragon Age 2 have something in common, and every time I watch an episode of Targaryen Family Dinners I am reminded of it. It's nothing to do with dragons, nor is it anything to do with inbreeding, because that would be weird. But it has everything to do with time.\r\n\n\r\nOne of the most interesting ideas in Dragon Age 2, which was fairly criticised at the time (2011) for being rushed out and cutting corners, was that the game would take place across a number of years. It wasn't many: it jumped one year, then three years, then another three years, each leap happening at the beginning of each major act in the game. It wasn't rooted, as others are, in events taking place across days or weeks or months. This meant Dragon Age 2 could show you long-term consequences to your actions, and fast-forward storylines to get you back to the interesting bits.\r\n\n\r\nHouse of the Dragon does exactly the same thing. So far in the series we've jumped something like 19 years forwards in time. Part of this is out of necessity of course: the Fire and Blood novel it's based on is more like a history book than the zoomed-in adventure of A Song of Fire and Ice (which most people know as Game of Thrones). It charts 300 years of Targaryen rule, and only occasionally does it dive into notable rulers and passages of time - House of the Dragon being an example of this.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was a genuine delight when it launched some five years ago. This Switch-exclusive title combined X-COM style tactical gameplay with beautiful graphics and animation. It was made by Ubisoft, but had all of the polish you'd expect from a Nintendo first-party title - and arrived just a few months after the Switch debuted.\nNow, finally, the sequel is here, promising a substantially expanded scope alongside a reworked, more flexible combat system. Tech-wise, we're looking at another outing for Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine, the toolset best-known for powering The Division and its sequel. Gameplay is solid, but it comes at a cost: Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope lacks the same level of visual accomplishment as its predecessor. \r\n\n\r\nIt's all about the gameplay enhancements with this one, which are substantial. Sparks of Hope radically reworks the first title's combat. Gone are the movement grids, which have been replaced with a fully analogue traversal system. It's less contemplative, and feels like a more natural fit for a console controller. Critically, you can move a character as much as you like within certain boundaries without using a turn, which makes lining up abilities less stressful. Other actions, like throwing bombs and executing team jumps, are now fully unmoored from turns as well and require a bit of real-time dexterity to pull off. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "No Man's Sky has had a very strong redemption story. Originally released six years ago to widespread criticism over missing features, overblown promises, and barren content, the game has since expanded massively - delivering a transformed experience. Nowadays, it's an acclaimed sandbox title, with a wealth of customisation and base-building potential... which brings us to the new Switch release.\nUnlike the original PS4 version, expectations must be properly calibrated here, as developer Hello Games has admitted to cutting two key features - multiplayer and settlements - at least for this initial release. Early footage hasn't seemed particularly impressive either, but the prospect of a virtually infinite universe in the palm of your hand might be enough to offset that. So is this a worthy port? Or is No Man's Sky just 'too big' for Nintendo's hybrid console?\r\n\nNo Man's Sky is a fascinating and unique title. Fundamentally, most of what you see is based on procedural generation - the world geometry, weather, flora and fauna, and texturing are largely generated in real-time according to a preset seed code. Some elements do repeat, like patches of textures, or certain objects or body parts, but there's a surprising amount of variety here. That technology is used to create a highly open-ended sandbox. The curated content is fairly limited, but players can travel the stars, build massive bases, catalogue new species and planets, or tear apart the deformable voxel-based planetary terrain. No Man's Sky isn't a hardcore space sim, by any means, but it's far more tactile, approachable, and immediately engaging than games like Elite and Eve Online. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced it'll be bringing its Switch Sports servers back online tomorrow, 18th October, with players affected by the recent downtime getting an extra week added to their Nintendo Switch Online membership.\r\n\n\r\nSwitch Sports' servers were taking offline and save data backups were suspended on Friday, while Nintendo investigated a significant bug introduced in last week's 1.2.1 update that caused crashes on the game's pre-match loading screen, during both online and offline play.\r\n\n\r\nServers and save data backup functionality have remained unavailable since then, but Nintendo Japan has now offered an update on its website (thanks VGC), confirming the crashing was caused by a save writing error under certain conditions and revealing it'll be restoring all functionality across two waves later this week.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The series A Plague Tale: Requiem keeps reminding me of is Uncharted, and I didn't expect that. But not since Uncharted have I been so dazzled by a production, by an adventure, that I've lingered longer in places simply so they don't end. And not since an Uncharted game have I been treated to so many spectacular sights in so many spectacular places I have never even imagined before. Requiem, it turns out, is every bit a game about uncovering lost legends and their secrets. It's a treasure hunt. Only here, the treasure you're hunting for is a cure.\r\n\n\r\nA Plague Tale is a series inextricably tied to the Plague, the Black Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th Century and apparently killed as many 200 million people. It was the plague carried, infamously, by rats. And so it is that A Plague Tale is also a series about rats - wonderfully and gruesomely so.\r\n\n\r\nMore specifically, it's a series about a young boy called Hugo who has something called the Macula inside of him, a supernatural bond with the rats. And it's a bond that people are trying to exploit and control - powerful people in powerful, shady orders - and a bond that will also kill him if you, his teenage sister Amicia, don't find that cure.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Who is Luigi? The brother. The palette swap. The cringer and creeper, chattering Mario's name as he quakes and trembles in various ghost houses. All true. But there is another Luigi. The Luigi of the hard stare in Mario Kart. The Luigi who barges you off the road and wants you to know it was personal. And now: Luigi the sniper. Death from a distance. A cool heart and a steady gaze. Luigi winning the game and bringing us all home.\r\n\n\r\nLuigi was the sniper in the first Mario + Rabbids, a game that dared to ask, what if you gave everybody in the Mushroom Kingdom a bunch of guns? That's sort of an awful question, but Ubisoft managed to provide a surprisingly lovely answer for it: you'd get a knockabout version of XCOM. Mario taking cover. Peach healing. Toad going for overwatch. And Luigi sniping.\r\n\n\r\nThis Luigi business didn't click for me until I got stuck into the sequel: Sparks of Hope. Then it clicked instantly. Luigi as a sniper! Luigi with an attack that does more damage the further away from his target he gets. Stick Luigi up high and he becomes a god: in action, how like an angel, in apprehension, how like...well, stick him on Overwatch and see. Luigi sniping across the map, wracking up 2000 points of damage. Luigi watching as his enemies shatter into candied star bits. Luigi bringing us all home.\r\n \nRead more",

          "author": "Richard Leadbetter",
          "description": "I've been covering PC graphics hardware in earnest for around eight years now and I'm not sure I've seen a u-turn quite as profound as the RTX 4080 12GB 'unlaunching' situation. Logistically, the implications are profound: those cards have been manufactured, the packaging is likely waiting. The GPUs themselves may even have RTX 4080 branding that'll need to be addressed. Ultimately though, it was the right decision to make - as we discuss in this week's DF Direct.\r\n\n\r\nThe RTX 4080 12GB's pricing only really makes sense if you can ignore the existence of the RTX 3080 and the wealth of availability for the Ampere line-up both in terms of brand-new stock and second-hand bargains. Launching at $699 in 2020, it was based on the same GA102 processor as the much more expensive RTX 3090 - which was only about 15 percent faster. At the most extreme end, a $2000 RTX 3090 Ti arrived much later - and yet it's still only about 25 percent faster than the standard 3080. An $899 4080 12GB makes some kind of sense compared to those much more expensive GA102 offerings, but the $699 RTX 3080 follows it like a mocking shadow.\r\n\n\r\nNot helping matters are Nvidia's latest round of benchmarks. Three titles are chosen: Flight Simulator, A Plague Tale: Requiem and F1 22. Each game offers up varying performance differentials but the bottom line is that a notional 29 percent increase in cost against the RTX 3080 delivered a minimum 11 percent of extra performance at native 4K resolution (A Plague Tale: Requiem) and a maximum 24 percent in F1 22. DLSS 3 is used to beef up the numbers in favour of the new Ada Lovelace card - but while we're excited by the technology, it's not the finished article and its use in benchmarks isn't a great move, not least because only a few DLSS 3 titles are available. Whichever way you look at the RTX 3080 12GB, the spectre of the RTX 3080 looms too large.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've never actually seen the TV show before but from what little info I could gather, it seems like a bad idea to fuck with the Peaky Blinders. That's exactly what I did in this episode of VR Corner (above) though and, to be honest with you, the consequenses are nowhere near as bad as the Shelby's make them out to be. In fact, I had a pretty good time!\nEarlier this week, I was granted access to a press demo of Peaky Blinders that allowed me to smoke my way through the first few levels of the game. And I do mean smoke in the literal sense because, as you'll see in my video, you can spawn and smoke as many virtual cigarettes as you can fit into your lungs. Cough.\nJust like with Maze Theory's previous TV tie-in, Doctor Who: The Edge of Time, Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom is a superfan's dream come true. It gives you the ability to inhabit the world of your favourite TV show, interact with the cast, visit familiar locations and, most importantly, feel like you yourself are a part of the story.\n Read more",

          "description": "We often say that especially clever video games consist of \"shades of grey\", but there are just as many shades of blackness. The colour black has a strange, underground career in computer graphics and aesthetics, spread across different types of display and graphics hardware, different genres and art styles. The darkness of a Game Boy game is green-tinged and fertile, like a puddle of algae (and similarly reliant on sunlight). The darkness of a cathode-ray tube display is a dense fog sealed behind a bulging reflection - small wonder that Silent Hill's most atmospheric moments came before the advent of flatscreens. \r\n\n\r\nBlack symbolises death in western societies, of course, but it also denotes elegance and luxury, with artisans in every era striving to produce the lushest, finest grades of…",

          "description": "Earlier this year, I shared my thoughts on five incredible mechanical keyboards that had passed over my desk as of early 2022. There was a surprisingly warm response to that piece, and I planned soon to revisit the topic when I'd tested enough great keyboards to really justify it - next year, perhaps. Scarcely a few months later, and I've been lucky enough to test out nearly a dozen more mechanical keyboards - five of which are well worth writing about. \nSo, without further ado, here are five more lovely mechanical keyboards to have been released in 2022, from technological marvels to some uniquely aesthetic creations. Enjoy! \nOver in the Netherlands, keyboard firm Wooting has made a name for itself with a series of analogue mechanical keyboards that offer some unique advantages over more traditional designs. We've gone into more detail in past reviews - see our Wooting Two HE review, for example - but the main idea is that every key's movement can be measured, allowing you to turn a key into an analogue input, trigger different effects at different key depths and so on. Their latest board is the Wooting 60 HE, a 60 percent size model that is ideally suited for the competitive-minded gamers that are most likely to be interested in its feature set. \n Read more",

So, we're pressing the 'unlaunch' button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,\" says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases.\nUnveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it's fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.\nThe table below reveals that the spec differential wasn't just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.\n Read more",

Some of remake's environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Pokémon Go's annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event's first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. \r\n\n\r\n These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.\r\n\n\r\nNiantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There is no birth without sex, no life without birth, no birth without life, and no life without death. This cyclical motif is sewn throughout Scorn, running through it like a rotting umbilical cord. It's a world where animal and automation are fused together in an uneasy alliance, blended so seamlessly you're never entirely sure where organic matter ends and machine begins.\r\n\n\r\nFor such a taciturn game - Scorn has no text prompts, no dialogue, and no map; you move through its world by organic exploration, hope, luck, and nothing more - this circle-of-life stuff is surprisingly in your face. Before you're out of the opening hour, you will have pried a deformed form from a rotting egg and ripped an organic weapon from its umbilical holster moments before you're soaked in a thick, milky substance so overwhelming, it knocks you out. At the end, there are statues in, uh, compromising positions. Swollen abdomens and yes, more umbilical cords. Subtle this is not.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, Scorn is ripe with phallic imagery and actions. Our protagonist - a half-dead husk of a humanoid roaming around a (mostly) deserted alien world - endlessly thrusts their weapon into mysterious holes and sinks their fingers into fleshy control panels. There are holes and tubes and thrusting pistons - enough to make Freud blush - all openly inspired by the nightmare dreamscapes of the grimly delightful H.R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksiński. It is stunningly disgusting and disgustingly stunning in all the right ways and for all of Scorn's faults - and I have a few, I'm afraid - its meticulously detailed aesthetic is not one of them. \r\n \nRead more",

Overwatch 2's launch menu art is a classic example of this - and also, a convenient cross-section for the game's wonderfully varied, albeit mostly returning characters. There's Tracer, original mascot and the game's worst troll, using her teleport dash to mess up the enemy rearguard, then rewinding herself to safety. There's Mercy, a single-target healer who handles like a ninja given a well-spaced team, with the ability to swoop towards allies. And Genji, an actual ninja - terrifying with his sword unsheathed, a puny, scuttling annoyance to any hero whose shots he can't parry. \r\n\n\r\nHeading the group is Sojourn, one of …",

That series has some of the most memorable weapons to have featured in a video game and they’re a joy to use, but DOOM 2’s Super Shotgun felt especially amazing. I can still hear the incredible ‘BOOM’ it made as it fired, and that super satisfying trio of clicks that it made as new shells were loaded into it. The best bit though was the way that any hellspawn unlucky enough to be stood right in front of the barrel would just burst into gibs as soon as you pulled the trigger. It delivered such stupidly incredible carnage, it was overexaggerated, amped-up annihilation and up until recently, it felt like one of the most powerful video game guns I’d ever fired.\n Read more",

Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation's userbase would be \"significantly larger\" than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony's own complaints about the deal at face value. \r\n\nIs this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Insomniac Games' formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port's system-specific features and requirements.\r\n\n\r\nIn case it somehow wasn't immediately obvious, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man, taking the first game's acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.\r\n\n\r\n\"Insomniac's second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original,\" said Eurogamer's Martin Robinson wrote in his Recommended review, \"but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It's a game that's full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.\"\r\n \nRead more",

That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. \nHowever, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as \"The Springfield Files.\"\n\r\nThis episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer's conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out.

          "description": "Ever since it sprung from the remnants of Capcom's Clover Studios back in 2007, PlatinumGames has become synonymous with a certain brand of over-the-top action; think the knee-sliding shotgun ballet of Vanquish, the stylish sucker punch of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance or the madcap superhero adventure of The Wonderful 101. Throughout all that there's been one constant - the devilish and daring Bayonetta, as close as the Osaka studio has as an official mascot, who's finally on the cusp of her third outing. Having played a sizable chunk of Bayonetta 3, all signs are pointing towards it being her best yet too. \r\n\n\r\nLike previous entries, this is an action game cast firmly in the mould of Devil May Cry (Devil May Cry creator Hideki Kamiya returns here as executive director for Bayonetta 3), with whip-quick third-person combat at its core. Unlike something like Devil May Cry 5, however, which saw Capcom retool and refine that core combat towards something like perfection, Bayonetta 3 builds outwards in a work of maximalist beauty. This is a game that throws in the kitchen sink, the dishwasher and tumble dryer and just about anything it can at you, and the result is intoxicating if never exactly coherent. \r\n\n\r\nThere's only two sections we're free to discuss in this last preview before we give the final verdict, but they illustrate the point perfectly well. First, we've a gauntlet run through modern-day Tokyo with Bayonetta herself, summoned into the real world through an oh-so-fashionable multiverse hook. What it means, in practice, is getting to see Bayonetta transposed onto something like real-life, racing through a city that's being destroyed by a colossal shark demon as she surfs atop the giant dragon Gomorrah, crashing along spiralling skyscrapers before donning cruise liners for a set of impromptu water skates. Bayonetta 3, in case you hadn't already guessed, does not trade in subtlety. \r\n \nRead more",

Because of this, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some articles on the site that explore mental health and its relationship to games.\nRaising awareness about the topic of mental health in general is something I am deeping passionate about, and I have lived with mental illnesses myself for some time now. I take a variety of regular medications to help with this, and, combined with cognitive behavioural therapy, these have worked well for me and my ongoing recovery.\nWhile they aren't designed to be therapeutic, games have often provided me with a safe refuge to escape to. This can often include jumping back into a title from my childhood and experiencing that unrivalled nostalgic joy once more (I will forever have a soft spot for The Italian Job on the PlayStation 2 for this very reason).\n Read more",

          "description": "One of my clearest lockdown memories is of going for a lunchtime walk with Olaf Stapledon. It was somewhere near the start of things, I think, no cars on the roads and those government mandated exercise breaks still feeling weirdly illicit. There is a stretch of the South Downs behind my house which I am ashamed to say I had never visited until Covid. One morning I set out over the gentle grassy hump of its hill, over the buried spine of the thing, with the almost indescribable vastness of Stapledon's novel Star Maker playing in my headphones.\r\n\n\r\nStar Maker is all about a journey through the cosmos - deep into space and out the other side, really. But that day its wild intergalactic journey actually served to root me more deeply in the landscape I was exploring. I remember the broken chalky earth where the badgers make their sets, the dew pond with its looping swallows, a lonely bench pointed at nothing where I sat in silence for a space of time that was maybe twenty minutes, maybe an hour. I was learning, all the time. Over the course of that morning ramble I learned afresh how to be in nature.\r\n\n\r\nAnd this is exactly what Paradise Marsh teaches. It's a small game, but also a gigantic one: truly a Stapledonian trick of time and space. I load it up and explore a colourful endless wetlands, cycling through day and night, spring, summer, autumn and winter. There's an objective of sorts - I'm armed with a net as I plod around and I have a book of creatures to capture - but it's an objective I have not really focused on for the most part. Instead I wander. I watch and listen, I see the different shades of the sky as it moves from peach to strawberry yogurt to dark bubbling storm clouds. I enjoy the rain one moment and the snow the next. I enjoy the silence - my silence.\r\n \nRead more",

Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?\r\n\n\r\nAlas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift's big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year's Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light.

          "description": "There have been some rumblings that Sony, along with developer Naughty Dog, decided to release its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) to monopolise on the upcoming HBO series inspired by the game.\nHowever, PlayStation head Hermen Hulst has made it known that this is not the case. Well, at least, it is not entirely the case.\nChatting to Axios, Hulst stated that the initial 2013 release of The Last of Us was \"a little ahead of its time in terms of its creative vision\". Hulst claimed that the limitations of technology at this time meant that Naughty Dog's ideas ultimately had to be dialled back a notch or two. \n Read more",

          "description": "I recently discovered that I am towards the micromanagement end of the scale when it comes to Football Manager. Or maybe more accurately, off the end of that scale, a spec in the distance visible only with the kind of magnifying glass I use to inspect my player's daily training habits. I'm the one you hear about with the spreadsheets and the 100 percent press conference attendance record, and while I have no shame at all, it has always made me a bit sceptical of FM's portable modes, the recent Xbox versions included.\r\n\n\r\nHaving played it for a good few hours of it up at developer Sports Interactive's studios, however, the new PS5 version of FM23 goes a good way towards putting me at ease. There are a few versions here, so for clarity a quick whip-round: Football Manager is the fullest version, which you can only play on PC; FM Mobile is the lightest version designed for playing on commutes and sun loungers, with a heavily trimmed-back set of features and systems; FM Touch is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Mobile, designed for the Switch; FM Xbox was brought in more recently and is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Touch, but still a long way off from full-fat Football Manager. \r\n\n\r\nThis year, with the arrival of the PS5 version, things have been rejigged a little. The Xbox version is gone, and there's now FM Console, which is the same across PS5 and Xbox (but Switch is still Touch). FM Console is definitely lighter than the full version, but also far, far closer to it than ever before. In brief, it feels like the main, PC Football Manager game was the starting point here, with things tweaked to fit into a console-style user experience, as opposed to being built from the Mobile version outwards.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The embargo lifts today on Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 and it's a phenomenal achievement in graphics performance - as you might hope and expect from a $1600/£1650 GPU. The full Eurogamer review will follow as soon as possible but so much work in Digital Foundry has been poured into this project that we've only just managed to finish the video review in time. With minutes left until the embargo lifts, I wanted to share the review with the Eurogamer audience - and to offer up some personal thoughts on the product.\nFirst of all, I think it is important to stress that the power level of this product shows a leap in performance that surrounding components within a gaming PC may struggle to fully access. 1080p and 1440p metrics with this product are essentially meaningless - even with my Core i9 12900K overclocked to 5.2GHz on all performance cores, I'm finding frame-rates hitting the CPU limit. This happens even on some 4K benchmarks without ray tracing in the equation. And even if you are using RT, opting for DLSS performance mode (with an internal 1080p base image) can again see you hitting the limits of your processor.\nOver the last few weeks, it's been really interesting just to 'live' with the card for PC gaming - I use a 4K 120Hz LG OLED CX display, and it's a good fit for the RTX 4090. I don't need to worry about settings, I don't need to worry about performance. I'd venture to suggest that for non-RT gaming, the graphics problem is 'solved'. Ray tracing? No worries there either, thanks to DLSS. However, if I did not have a 4K 120Hz display, I do wonder whether I'd need the 4090. That's my subjective opinion on gaming with the card, but here's the full video review where you get all the numbers you need.\n Read more",

My own notes from a recent online presentation suggest it's a WoW raid mixed with a bit of Puyo Tetris. Having had the time to think about it, though, I suspect the whole thing is like one of those fancy cocktails where the different elements separate and form a rainbow strata: Evercore Heroes is simple at first, then complicated, and then ultimately pretty simple again. And hopefully delicious.\r\n\n\r\nHere's where I'd start. You jump into a team of four heroes, all working through a sort of raid area.

She'd had such high hopes for it after Red Dead Redemption 1, a game and series she really rates. But when AC3 came along and horses were nothing more than disposable taxis you could pick up at every outpost, she was sorely disappointed. The game didn't even save your horse choice through loading screens. She's been speaking out about horses in games ever since.\nShe does it on the wonderfully named website The Mane Quest, where her in-depth reviews - she records horse movement and analyses it frame by frame - have earnt her a loyal following. Her work, and her background in game design, eventually even got her a job making a horse game called  Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is out really soon on PC and Switch.\nSo how bad are horses in games today? Read on, dear reader. I'll deal with a few famous games before broadening into more general mistakes, and what they can do about them. All of this is taken from my podcast interview with Alice Ruppert, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts (look for \"Eurogamer Podcasts\").\r\n\t\n Read more",

Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft's long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.\r\n\n\r\nSpencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, \"Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary.\" Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that's supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.\r\n\n\r\nAs described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was 'pivoting away' from the then-current iteration to refocus on \"a new approach\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Do we really need a Horizon Zero Dawn remake? That was the first topic on this week's Digital Foundry Direct, as John, Rich and Alex grapple with the prospect of a PS5 remaster of a recently-released PlayStation 4 title. \nIt's a hard question to answer, as undoubtedly the team at Guerrilla Games wants their work to be playable at the best possible quality, but the 2017 PS4 release already runs well on PS5 thanks to a patch - and the PC edition from 2020 remains one of the best-looking games on the platform two years later. Creating a remake could be a good way for the developers to work on a PS5-only engine for future titles but that same development time could also be devoted to an entirely new Horizon game, albeit one that won't result in an influx of cash for the company quite as soon. \nIt's an interesting point of discussion, and the rest of the spreadsheet that spawned the Horizon Zero Dawn remake rumour also makes for entertaining reading. There's mention of a Horizon multiplayer 'live service' game for PS5 and PC and a new Death Stranding, for example. \n Read more",

Because I did and I actually had a wonderful time playing demos of four upcoming PSVR2 games on Sony's new  VR headset. Inspired by that preview session, on this week's episode of VR Corner (above), I decided to dig into the ever-growing list of confirmed PSVR 2 titles and whittle it down to the 13 games I'm most excited to play. Fair warning, as this is my opinion only and it's my favourite VR genre, there are a lot of shooters in there so shout outs to the runners up, Demeo and Ultrawings 2 that just missed out on making the cut for this list.\nFirewall Ultra\nSo far details are light on what Firewall Ultra, the PSVR 2 exclusive follow up to Firewall Zero Hour has to offer in terms of new gameplay. However, the original was one of my all-time favourite PSVR titles and this tactical shooter delivered some superb Rainbow Six Siege style gameplay that just felt phenomenal to experience in VR. The sneak peeks of gampelay we’ve been shown in recent trailers have sent my anticipation levels into overdrive though. Not only are we bound to see much better visuals this time around, thanks to the PSVR2’s 4K HDR but (according to a splash screen at the end of the Firewall Ultra reveal trailer) the game will also take advantage of all the PSVR2’s new hardware features such as finger touch detection, foveated rendering, adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. Which means you’re actually going to feel it the next time you get shot in the head by the opposition!\n Read more",

I'm not just talking about making choices in an RPG, but the way every single press of a button or tilt of a stick adds up to make your playthrough different from mine. While we always bring something of ourselves to books, movies or albums, the core text never changes. Unless you decide to cut up a novel and then stick the pages together in the wrong order or something.\r\n\n\r\nYou can watch someone else play a game, and there are now more ways to do so than ever, but it's not the same as poking around in someone else's game, something I'd never given any thought to. Not until I saw a message on Twitter asking for help with Elden Ring. This person, who I'm going to call Sellen, because they asked to be anonymous and it's the first Elden Ring NPC name that sprang to mind, had messed up their Elden Ring save game. They'd accidentally killed an NPC that they very much did not want to kill and were quite distraught. They shared that save with their partner and didn't want to potentially ruin the game for them.\r\n\n\r\nSellen was offering to pay someone to recreate their Elden Ring save, but without the unfortunate death of poor Jar Bairn. I can totally understand why, as young JB is an adorable little example of Elden Ring's fascinating pot people. Paying someone to play a game for you may seem strange, but after chatting with them privately, I discovered that they were both busy folks with little time to play games. While they'd only played the game for sixteen hours or so, that represented a couple of months of shared time that would be hard to get back. Intrigued by the challenge recreating their save presented, I accepted the oddest commission of my freelance career so far.\r\n \nRead more",

Enter Das Keyboard to redress the balance with the amusingly named MacTigr. This keyboard offers a full Mac layout, mechanical switches, a volume knob and plenty of creature comforts - but is it worth its exorbitant $219 asking price? \nFirst, my credientials: as someone that splits their time between Windows and MacOS, I've been agitating for a proper dedicated MacOS keyboard to swap to. For too long Mac users have been lumbered with the runts of the litter when it comes to keyboards - the current selection is generally awash with non-mechanical options with mushier keys and less consistent key action - even Apple's own Magic Keyboards aren't all that magic. So, the MacTigr has the potential to deliver a considerable upgrade, with the functionality that Mac users rely on and the mechanical switches they don't know they're missing.\nThe MacTigr is a board that offers the traditional Mac layout, odd function keys and all, in a clean and sharp-looking package. The outer casing is comprised almost entirely of metal with a steel top plate and aluminium casing, which means the MacTigr features plenty of heft - it weighs in at 2.4lbs, or just over a kilo for metric users. It's remarkably well made, with no signs of deck flex in the case, even under intense typing load, and feels excellent. Despite that heft though, the MacTigr is especially slim and modern looking, especially thanks to its use of MX Low Profile switches, more of which I'll talk about in a moment. \r\n \nRead more",

The servers haven't worked, there are huge queues to play in the evening, and even when people can log in, there are overly complicated character unlock systems and bolshy Battle Passes to contend with. It's not entirely clear what's new in this second game when you can play it, either.\r\n\nOverwatch 2 is overwhelmingly Overwatch. It's the same conclusion Edwin Evans-Thirlwell came to in a quick impressions piece published this week while he works on his full review. And it's hard not to agree with him. Faced with the same maps and the same characters, Overwatch 2 feels like the same game so many of us will have played so many times before. The differences are there, though, and given time, they make themselves felt. \r\n\n\r\nOverwatch 2 is the talking point of the week, then, and I've invited Edwin onto Weekly to talk about it.

          "description": "Nier Automata is one of the most celebrated last-generation action titles, marrying Platinum Games' signature stylings with inventive, varied gameplay and a mind-bending narrative. From a technical perspective though, the situation was far from ideal: the game was beset by frame-rate and image quality issues on last-gen machines, with wobbly performance coupled with plenty of aliasing. This is why the Switch port came as a bit of a surprise when it was announced a few months ago: there's a huge performance gap between the Switch and even the base last gen consoles with precious little room to cut resolution before image quality becomes unacceptably poor. This seems like one of the so-called \"impossible ports\" - a technically demanding title downscaled for Nintendo's hybrid console, often with somewhat mixed results. \r\n\n\r\nThe challenge is clear - and it's all down to just how difficult this game was to run on PS4 and Xbox One. Despite relatively pedestrian visuals, the title targeted 900p without any anti-aliasing, with somewhat messy performance on both machines. The typical run of play was 40-60fps, with combat and open-world traversal causing issues. It's important to keep this relatively poor showing in mind, because the Nintendo Switch falls far short of those machines in raw number-crunching performance. So what kind of compromises are we seeing here? \r\n\n\r\nRelative to base last-gen consoles, the Switch release is comprehensively downgraded - though the overall image still looks surprisingly comparable. Measuring the game against its Xbox One S counterpart, the first thing that stands out is a significant reduction in texture detail. Across the board, textures are degraded, with lower resolutions not to mention simplified layers and material properties. In some areas, the textures look soupy, with no fine detail to speak of, though most of the time it's not quite as severe. \r\n \nRead more",

For those eager to learn more about the world, as well as what the different factions and kingdoms are like, it's a must watch.\nThis trailer comes some time following the State of Play trailer we received back in the summer, the last big update we’ve gotten for the game/ While we got a glimpse of some of the major summons in the game, as well as some breadcrumbs narrative-wise, this trailer unleashes a torrent of new details \nWe know that the devs have stuck with action combat in an attempt toappeal to a more modern crowd, and from what we’ve seen in trailers that seems to have turned out quite well thanks to some really dynamic looking action as well as a lot of spectacle (as you’d expect from a spectacle fighter), lots of high flying and flashy attacks certain give off an exciting feel to what we’ve seen so far.\n Read more",

And for a game which boldly kills the Batman in the first two minutes, that’s pretty astonishing.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s not all bad: there are some nice ideas dotted around. Occupying The Belfry between missions gives the game a nice overall pace, allowing you to spend time with the characters in some touching, backstory filling cutscenes (though, note of caution, these bits are laser-targeted at Arrowverse fans, a group of people who would inject mediocrity like heroin were it possible). The investigation gameplay also has a few neat touches, like the micro-examination of people’s workspaces and personal tech. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Gotham Knights is finally here, the latest in a nearly two-decades old legacy of third-person action titles that has allowed us to jump into Batman’s spandex attire to solve mysteries, beat up thugs, and face off against a legendary collection of dastardly villains. Now, however, Batman is dead. Gotham Knights instead puts us in control of four bat proteges as they try their best to fit all eight of their feet into Batman’s comically large shoes. \nThe background for this attempt? A third-person action game where you, as one of the team, head out into Gotham City to fight crime in typical Batman style. With a cast of characters to assist you and Alfred Pennyworth to provide some much-needed advice, you leap from building to building fighting the good fight. In doing so, you level up, upgrade your gear, and spend ability points on a variety of skill trees. It is 2022, after all. \nTo spare you the customary tedious backstory, Gotham Knights is a decent adventure filled with mystery, revelations, and equal parts sneaking around and breaking noses. Bar a near narrative swerve into a devastating car crash in the later hours of the game, the story of moving on from Batman and Bruce Wayne while figuring out what happened to the playboy is told with the appropriate levels of mourning and drama you would expect. The idea that Batman was Batman and none of the remaining heroes will ever be the caped crusader is slowly but surely established as they each resolve their own issues and come together to take up the torch. \n Read more",

The developer is behind horror titles Layers of Fear and The Medium, which are both perfectly average. I guess we can now all be relieved that those leaks can be laid to rest at least.\nMasahiro Ito, creature designer for Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, and Silent Hill 3, (also art director on both 2, and 3) is finally back on board, too. With Ito, the creator of Pyramid Head himself on board, this remake already shows some promise. Let's now just hope that Bloober Team can pull this out the bag.\n Read more",

Announced only a few days ago, Konami has set up a giant, much-hyped up event to showcase the latest details on the next entry into the Silent Hill franchise, which has been sadly absent from the modern gaming space. You can watch it right here, using the embedded stream link below.\nThe stream is set to take place at 2PM PDT / 10PM BST / 5PM ET / 4PM CT today (October 19), at which point the entire Silent Hill community (a mix of really old people who’ve actually played the good ones and younger folks who just pretend they have to look cool to their gamer friends) will tune in.\nSilent Hill is one of those video game franchises with a lot of weight behind them. First hitting the market with the striking Silent Hill back in 1999, the game wouldn’t hit its stride until the legendary Silent Hill 2 dropped only two years later in 2001. This was a bar setter in the world of horror video games, with a narrative that remains in the mind of many unparalleled by the rest of the series, and much of the wider genre ever since.\n Read more",

In a tight, closely competitive competition between it and AMD, software has always been one of the key differentiators. In the last hardware generation, Nvidia added a new piece of software that I casually dismissed - but as the 3000 series generation drew to a close, I finally tried it - and found myself hooked on it.\r\n\n\r\nI’m talking about Nvidia Reflex, a little bonus software option that uses your fancy high-end graphics hardware and various clever methods to reduce the input lag between your input devices - primarily keyboard and mouse, of course, but this’d also work with controllers - in turn theoretically making you more deadly in-game.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the 30-series first launched, I dabbled with Reflex but never really paid it too much attention. I was more interested in improved versions of the frame-rate boosting DLSS, and how it’d let me crank up the visual fidelity and real-time lighting in newer games like Cyberpunk 2077. But recently, I returned to Reflex  - and in that return, I realized what an impressive tool it is.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It’s been eight years of The Sims 4, and it’s endless amount of packs and expansions. Given this amount of time, fans of the series were beginning to ask what was next for their favourite game.\nAt long last, EA has finally revealed a teaser for the future of The Sims series, dubbed ‘Project Rene’ rather than The Sims 5; that said, this is likely what will become the fifth mainline Sims instalment, but there’s no telling if that’s actually the case just yet. By the looks of things, Project Rene still has a long while to go before it’s finally available to launch.\nDeveloper, Maxis, shared its plans during the Behind the Sims Summit, which detailed what’s next for the series and how the developer plans to find new ways for players to both experiment and express themselves.\n Read more",

A pretty bold start to us trying to answer the \"are skins pay-to-win\" question for Valorant, then.\nValorant is a tactical shooter that pits five attackers against five defenders, bearing similarities to the likes of Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Rainbow Six Siege. As each team tries to either lock down a site or to retake it, players must use a combination of skill, communication, and their characters abilities to secure a win. Whether the power of friendship is on your side or not, the most important aspect of Valorant, arguably, is strategising with your team.\n Read more",

          "description": "A lot of the discussion around Dreamlight Valley – Disney’s astonishingly flagrant Stardew Valley rip-off – has been around how it holds up mechanically against its cosy farming peers. It’s certainly worth talking about things such as crop diversity, villager interaction, and hoe-feel in a game like this... but nobody seems to be addressing Dreamlight’s unique feature. That at any moment, an evil cartoon lion inspired by Adolf Hitler could move into town.\nA post about the game’s impending update shows Scar as the star of the show, the next big Disney character being added to the game, posing peacefully next to the Disney Adult player character. Our elderly readers will remember Scar’s behaviour in the 28-year-old film The Lion King as being somewhat less than peaceful, his main hobbies including murdering kings in front of their child’s eyes and performing impassioned musical numbers about race science to his army of goose-stepping hyenas. Somewhere between the regicide and being torn to shreds by his own minions, Dreamlight offers the possibility that maybe Scar took a brief sabbatical by moving to a peaceful rural town and offering a mining bonus and a reward track filled with Lion King-themed furniture to the mayor.  \nThe experience of playing this game is already deeply bizarre. Dreamlight is trying to tap into the warm, pastoral vibes of Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, but that fantasy is constantly butting up against the complex and messy reality of characters with such disparate morals being treated identically from a mechanical standpoint.\n Read more",

          "description": "2012’s Uncharted: Golden Abyss wasn’t the best Uncharted game. It wasn’t even the best game on Vita at the time, but that didn’t really matter. It was an Uncharted game that looked great, running on a handheld. Those of you who can’t really remember handhelds before the Switch might not understand, but there was something properly magical about seeing games that looked like this on a portable device. The future for the Vita looked exciting... until it wasn’t. RIP, PS Vita – you deserved a lot better. \r\n\n\r\nAnyway, cut to now, and we have another Uncharted game – two in fact – running on a handheld, and once again I’ve got that magical feeling. A sense that I’m living the future right now. The Steam Deck, Valve’s superb handheld Linux PC, packs quite the punch (especially when you look at how it’s priced not far from a Switch OLED – a machine way, way less powerful). The Legacy of Thieves Collection combines PS4 hits, Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy, and while I’m sure it runs great on a proper desktop PC, I have played it exclusively “on deck” so to speak. I love it. \r\n\n\r\nI’m no longer a tech wizard, mainly because I just don’t have the time to keep up on all the latest happenings in the GPU space, but I can tell you this. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves looks absolutely smashing on the Steam Deck. I messed around a little with the graphical settings, and by using AMD’s Fidelity FX Super Resolution 2 on “Balanced” I was able to run on the “high” graphical pre-set at a frame rate that mostly hit 35-40 FPS. \r\n \nRead more",

We released our review for this game just yesterday, giving it a very positive review and noting that developers Asobo “should be proud of what it achieved in this game, as depressing and engrossing as it is.”\nIf you’re looking for something that packs a bit more of a horrific tone — we are in the Halloween season after all — we’ve got both The Amnesia Collection and Amnesia: Rebirth coming to console and PC starting October 20. A legendary series that kicked off the first person horror age that kicked life back into a dwindling genre back in 2010, it’s well worth a playthrough if you’ve not played it yet. \n Read more",

Silent Hill fans are incredibly passionate about the franchise, although many of us are primarily passionate about seeing those original games on modern consoles. Right now, it’s a battle to play Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 on modern devices, and honestly, they might be old and haggard at this point, but they still have something very special about them.\nIt’s been ten years since we last received a mainline Silent Hill game, Silent Hill: Downpour, and almost two decades since we last received a properly good Silent Hill game (excluding PT, if you’d actually count that as a Silent Hill game, given it never got the chance to really be one).

Bursting up from the ground, through walls, hugging the edge of the light and filling every dark space.

          "description": "During the Dutch revolt from 1566 to 1648, there was a cruel general of the Geuzen named Diederik Sonoy that supposedly employed rats as a method of torture on captured troops. He’d take a starving rat, a pottery bowl, and embers of charcoal from a nearby fire and show them to the accused. The rat – intentionally starved and kept separate from other creatures – would be placed on the naked body of a prisoner. The bowl would be placed over the rat, and the charcoals added on top. The rat would gnaw into the very bowels of the victim, as it tried desperately to escape. More often than not, the rat and the prisoner would die. The rat’s destruction in an attempt at self-preservation was all for nothing. \nThat’s what A Plague Tale: Requiem feels like; your protagonist duo, Amicia and Hugo, are the rats. They rip an almost-unbelievable path of destruction through 14th Century France as they run, panicked, from the death and disease that they cannot shake. They wreak havoc on the fragile body of a country torn apart by war, pestilence, famine, and death. Cruelty and inhumanity pushes them forward as the world falls apart behind them, and in trying to be kind they do some of the most horrific damage you’re liable to see in a video game this year. \nA Plague Tale: Requiem is not for the faint-hearted – and not just because of the 300,000 rats the developers can summon on-screen at once. The central story is a grim reflection of a human race that is, inherently, cruel. It’s a story about how even the brightest and most caring of us can be pushed to our limits and become unhinged; violent and disaffected and barbaric. It’s a game that is aware of what it makes you do – how it makes you kill, even if you don’t want to – and pulls on that guilt to make you, and your characters, suffer. In A Plague Tale: Requiem, you are the rat being forced through the body of a France that knows nothing but sorrow, and you will find you just can’t stop eating – no matter how much it hurts you.\n Read more",

          "description": "Bastion mains are currently suffering some deep, dark sadness as a result of their best boy being removed from Overwatch 2. The character, a lovable robot who could turn into a rocket-spewing killing machine with their ultimate ability, was ripped from the game due to an easy-to-do and super overpowered bug, leaving the Bastion mains in a kind of depressive limbo.\n“Should it really take 5+ days to fix an ultimate?” writes r/BastionMains user HyperBastiorean, lashing out at Blizzard for taking so long to fix their favourite hero. Five days isn’t even really that long a stretch, but such is the connection between certain Bastion buds on the internet, striking out at others like Sickboy on his epic heroin comedown in Trainspotting.\nSome bravely believe they can live a life without Bastion, in spite of their life leading them to become commenters on the Bastion subreddit. Dodo501 writes: “I already uninstalled, I refuse to play trash without Bastion. Won't be reinstalling even if/when he's added back.” Indeed, for all the genuine hardship Overwatch 2 players have had to undergo, such as an awful battle pass and phone verification system, it must suck to have your beloved main character removed.\n Read more",

Titles like Hearthstone, YuGiOh, and Magic the Gathering have all established their own entrenched positions in the video game market, bringing the decades-old  hobby to computers, to consoles, and especially to mobile. Enter Marvel Snap, a new challenger to the big hitters with the word accessibility at its back in gleaming golden letters, and the team at Second Dinner Studios trying to recapture the spirit of an older, youthful card game experience.\nTo guide me through the game, and the goals the team has for it, is Ben Brode: flannel shirt aficionado, formerly of Blizzard Entertainment's Hearthstone team and currently chief development officer at Second Dinner Studios. While the studio has obviously got a long list of content courses it'd like to dish out through seasonal releases and ongoing updates, can it make a dent?\nBut before we get into the nitty gritty, what is Marvel Snap? Well, it's a quickfire card game which has each play fill out three spaces on the board, each with four card slots and their own active modifiers that range from buffs to cards played there to limits on what you can place there. In six turns, both competitors must try and fill up these spaces with cards in their deck,with every card possessing their own power figure and abilities   It's the perfect type of game for phones in my mind, super fast and easy to grasp.\n Read more",

And as spotted by Exputer, Activision has recently published a new patent that involves \"systems and methods for dynamically generating and modulating music based on gaming events, player profiles and/ or player reactions.\"\r\n\n\r\nLet's layout what this means roughly: say you're in a match of your favourite Activision developed, multiplayer title, like a Call of Duty game for example! You're down to your last round, your health isn't doing so good, and you're surrounded. By the sounds of things, this patent would allow the soundtrack to be custom tailored to these specific set of circumstances, producing a unique piece of music for the player. \r\n \nRead more",

PT, the demo for the since called Silent Hills game, is a bit of an enigma in 2022.\nPT arrived as an obscure demo in 2014. It wasn’t until a short while later that someone figured the enigma out, and realised it was for an upcoming Silent Hill game. Then, Silent Hills was cancelled after a fallout between Konami and Hideo Kojima, leaving PT to be removed from the PlayStation Store and to fade into obscurity.\nThat said, people have been chasing the PT high ever since. There’s been various PC clones of the demo, many of them great but none of them perfect, and of course, in light of news regarding a jailbreak for the PS5, many tried their luck at installing PT once more. Sadly, the game could be installed, but there was no way of running it. Until now, anyway.\n Read more",

We’ve experienced rumour after rumour, leak after leak, and still haven’t heard so much as a whisper from Konami. It had got to the point where many fans desperately hoped for a new instalment in the pivotal horror series, but many had accepted it might never happen. Instead, we've been left trying - and struggling - to replay some of the best horror games of all time since.\nIt’s been an entire decade since the last full Silent Hill game, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, and seven years since we were all elated over P.T., before then being scorned by the cancellation of Silent Hills. Needless to say, the journey of being a Silent Hill fan is a rather rocky one.\nWell, Konami are full of surprises, it seems. Last night, the official Silent Hill Twitter account shared, “In your restless dreams, do you see that town? The latest updates for the SILENT HILL series, will be revealed during the #SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM PDT.” Yeah, Konami. I’ve been having restless dreams about that town since I was a child; why do you think most of us can’t wait to go back?\n Read more",

Now, director of the project Seth Kearsley has shared the full animatic pilot online, and it honestly isn't the worst thing in the world.\r\n\n\r\nThe animatic is narrated by Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket, a companion of protagonist Sora in the original game, and fits very well as such considering he keeps a journal of the games events canonically.

Earlier this month it was confirmed that prolific voice actor Jennifer Hale would be taking over the role, with the game's director Yusuke Miyata saying that, \"various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role.\" But now Taylor has posted a series of videos on her personal Twitter where she claims that she ultimately had to decline returning due to only being offered $4000 for the performance.\r\n\n\r\n\"I am asking the fans to boycott [Bayonetta 3], and instead spend the money that you would have spent on this game donating it to charity,\" Taylor asked of fans in the first of four videos she posted on Twitter yesterday, October 15. \"I didn't want the world. I didn't ask for too much. I was just asking for a decent, dignified, living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Advancements in PC graphics always move at a breakneck speed, but it does feel like things have been moving particularly quickly of late. Every recent new generation features leaps that are an order of magnitude larger than the last - though keeping up has also involved breaking the bank, either due to initially high vendor pricing or ridiculous gouging driven by crypto nonsense. The trend continues with Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 4090 - a jaw-droppingly powerful new flagship card with a neat party trick: it breaks performance measurement.\r\n\nWhat I mean by this is that the 4090 routinely and quite effortlessly does what I’ve only seen other cards do in very specific circumstances: it hits the point at which games can’t perform any better - not because of the card, but because the CPU can’t keep picking up what this beastly GPU is throwing down. This was primarily happening at lower resolutions like 1080p and 1440p but even occurred occasionally at 4K - and it was occurring with relatively recent games like Marvel’s Spider-Man. Maybe this’ll change with the imminent release of Intel’s 13th generation ‘Raptor Lake’ CPUs will help that element of the PC to catch up.\r\n\nRegardless of what happens there, I feel like this is a pretty potent place to start a discussion about the 4090. At £1650/$1600, it carries an overwhelming price, but what you get for that is also overwhelming performance. This card is the new benchmark, the new high watermark - though it’s really only going to be completely worth it for those who have an entire setup that can support it - which means at the very least a top-range monitor and CPU, plus an overly-healthy amount of RAM. \n Read more",

Certainly, in Sony-owned countries like the UK, it seemed everyone was waiting for it. It didn't really matter that the launch line-up was a bit naff, that the console itself looked hideous, or that it was ridiculously expensive. The follow-up to perhaps the greatest console of all time, the PS2, was a huge deal.\nBut what exactly were people desperate to play on their new PS3? I was at the March 2006 UK launch, somewhere in London, probably in a store that no longer exists and is now a Greggs. While there we interviewed the now Stadia-failer Phil Harrison – who is essentially a giant. I'd never spoken to a man so intimidatingly large before. Phil, as big a deal as he was in his PlayStation days (lots of ducks, etc) was not my highlight of the evening. Oh no. It was the public. More specifically, the actual batshit reasons some of them were buying a new PS3 a billion pounds.\r\n \nOne person, a young man with a pencil-thin moustache, quite enthusiastically told me: \"Sonic.\" This took me by great surprise, so much so that I almost laughed for the first time since BBC2 comedy show \"Fist of Fun\" aired in 1995. But I digress. This person was queueing for hours in order to spend £425 (plus the price of the game) to play a utterly terrible Sonic game, which everyone knew was terrible as it had been released on the Xbox 360 the previous year.\n Read more",

For all you Grims and Ghouls out there, Doktor’s Curse will be available to play up until November 2, allowing players to skulk and hide from the dreadful dead in the Doktor’s Castle map.\nPlayers on the defending team will have to hide from a monstrous attacking team coming at them with only breaching hammers and a single tracking gadget, making use of their environment and survivalist skills to stay undetected with the aid of a variety of unique traps and abilities.\nIn said game mode, you’ll be able to play as a variety of special monstrous versions of Siege characters, including Orux, Azami, Nomad, Thorn and Gridlock. If you wanna splash a bit of cash and celebrate the spooky season in style, there are bundles for Smoke, Kapkan, Frist, Lesion, Doc, Bandit, Sledge, Lion, Jackal, Aruni, (deep breath) and Ela. \n Read more",

It's been the most Blizzard launch we've seen for some time.\nIf you do manage to get into the title, you'll notice that the gameplay changes (or lack thereof) remain a frequent topic of conversation amongst the Overwatch hardcore. Some are complaining that things feel too similar, whilst others are miffed that the likes of Torbjörn and Bastion got temporarily taken out of the game because they were unfairly buggy.\nBut, now that we've seen those initial bugs fixed, we're not expecting any more massive changes any time soon. The developer behind the title, Blizzard, noted that it isn't planning “any immediate balance changes” for any of its heroes, aside from - perhaps – a small alteration to Zarya in one mode.\n Read more",

The rewards will be available for use in multiplayer, Special Ops, and in Warzone 2.0 when it launches on November 16.\nEach reward is likely tied to finishing certain missions, though the developer did not specify. Nevertheless, if you get early access to the campaign on October 20 by pre-ordering Modern Warfare 2, your unlocks will be ready to use at the launch of multiplayer a week later.\n Read more",

I’m expected to be quick with a quip and verbally insightful – and often have something to say about everything and anything – but Scorn continually left me lost for words. That is, except for the continuous swearing I did whenever I found myself stumped by a puzzle or particularly aggressive enemy. Which was often.\nThis first-person horror game, which is heavily inspired by the artwork of H. R. Giger (of Alien fame) and Zdzisław Beksiński, does a wonderful job of immersing and disorienting you in its desolate, biomechanical world. You – some sort of humanoid – wake up in this unfamiliar place, with no idea as to who or where you are, or what your purpose is. Immediately, however, it becomes clear that you probably want to get some answers and escape this place, and that’s what you set off to try and do.\nThe alien world you then proceed to explore is so intricately detailed that you’ll find yourself spending time just taking it all in; this facility is a mess of flesh, bones, and rotting mass that you must get to know. And I mean that literally. The environment is not just pretty to look at. It boasts bizarre alien technology in the form of puzzles, all of which connect to each other in one way or another.\n Read more",

The studio, regrettably, has been stuck in a rut.\r\n\n\r\nBut, with Bayonetta 3, Platinum comes dancing and jiving out of this lull in an explosion of keratin and Umbran magic. From the opening minutes – no, the opening seconds – Bayonetta 3 says “the witch is back, darling” and kicks any and all of your expectations to the curb. The languid pace of Astral Chain’s opening hours have been forgotten, the sub-par combat and service model of Babyon’s Fall cast aside; this is Platinum firing on all cylinders once again. And, damn, does it feel good.\r\n\n\r\nEverything you remember about Bayonetta and its sequel is present and accounted for: the razor-sharp combat, the best-in-class Witch Time dodging, the frantic-yet-measured melee, the over-the-top set pieces.

In other words, scaling for weapons, skills, spells etc. will now have different values in PvP in order to better balance the experience.\nPatch 1.07 heralds the start of this approach to balance, and it's the one FromSoft will be relying on moving forward.

          "description": "Earlier this week, we finally got an insight into just how much Microsoft earns from its Xbox Game Pass service thanks to some data coming out of Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (or CADE, if you're fancy). Per figures gleaned from the data, it was revealed that Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021 (not including Xbox Game Pass for PC).\nBut that may have raised the question about how much Microsoft spends on games as it adds them to the service. We know Microsoft's Chris Charla has admitted to paying developers and publishers \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in Game Pass license fees since the subscription service first came to our consoles, back in 2017. But we've never really had a specific figure to attach to Xbox Game Pass – or even Microsoft's subscription service rival, PS Plus.\nThat's changed now, though. Over on Twitter, Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach posted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by Snail Games USA  – who you may recognise as the parent company of Studio Wildcard, the developer behind Ark: Survival Evolved. And it shows a fascinating insight into how much platform holders are paying to feature titles in their monthly line-ups and services.\n Read more",

Experiencing the Battle Hub in the beta has shown me that it's more than that; it's a way to honor the past.\r\n\nIn real terms, the Battle Hub is simply a lobby system. Whereas in Street Fighter 4 or Street Fighter 5 matches were found through matchmaking systems that ran through regular menus, SF6 recontextualizes the wrapper around finding matches into a bizarre sort of Second Life-style, semi-MMO experience where you join a server and literally noodle around a 3D space.\r\n\nThere's a bit of cross-over with other modes, too. The character you run around with is created for the single-player World Tour mode, which we're yet to see much of – though now we at least know that you can create some wonderfully frightening-looking protagonists for it with a surprisingly open-ended character. The Street Fighter battles you'll participate in, meanwhile, are straight out of the versus 'Fighting Ground' mode I've previewed before – just online, instead of off. \r\n \nRead more",

What quickly emerged was Carpenter’s addiction to Fallout 76, “I got hooked on this Fallout 76 game. Been hooked for a good long time on it. You know, I know it had bugs coming out, and a lot of it was put down, but I thought it was great. It’s really fun to play.” He’d also mentioned he’d been keeping up with Borderlands and Horizon Forbidden West.\nIt was noted that Carpenter seems to enjoy open-world titles with more exploration, to which he said, “It’s fun. Your freedom to roam around and do it your way. And that’s what I love about Fallout.” There is a template to follow, there are missions, but you can do it differently.

The figure was unveiled from a large golden disco ball alongside Square Enix CEO Yosuke Matsuda, which I can now only assume is the way they reveal any big news within the company.\nThis is an astounding milestone for the game of course, which quickly rose in popularity in the west during both the COVID lockdowns and Activision Blizzard’s epic fumbling of the once lustrous World of Warcraft ball. It became so popular in fact that they had to stop new players from creating accounts!\nThat’s not all from the livestream either. Alongside the chunky 27 million flex, the team also seemed confident that they could reach 30 million by next year, coincidentally the 10-year anniversary of the MMORPG’s release. With the ever-growing popularity of the title, it’s hard to imagine it not making it to be honest, even with World of Warcraft: Dragonflight launching in late November and tempting back Blizzard refugees who may have jumped ship recently.\n Read more",

UNDECEMBER has managed to whip up something of a cult following already – and it’s not even out yet. \r\n\nIt’s probably because the cross-platform hack ‘n’ slash RPG is doing something different. In UNDECEMBER, you take on the role of a Rune Hunter: a hero destined to stop the 13th god of this world – one pre-determined to be evil and unholy – from being born. The other 12 gods shared out their powers and gifts to Rune Hunters, giving humans the ability to prevent the birth of their awful sibling. It’s up to you to hunt down those powers and use them for yourself. \r\n\nTo that end, in UNDECEMBER, there is no set class. When you boot up the game, you select either a male or female character, adjust your appearance, and then that’s it – you’re in the world. There’s no shaman, demon hunter, warrior, paladin; instead, you build your character with gears and skills of your choice as you move on.\r\n \nRead more",

Various countries around the world have decreed that loot boxes equate to gambling, with the UK government demanding publishers put measures in place that safeguard children from the adverse effects of them. 18 European countries have also backed measures calling for loot box regulation.\r\n\nFor Overwatch – one of the biggest games that popularised the use of loot boxes in the first place – to renege and opt for the battle pass (as seen in Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Fortnite, and many others besides)... that’s a big move. Seismic. It had the potential to rewrite the rule book, set a precedent for responsible and engaging progression whilst still monetizing the game. Because that, essentially, is what this is all about. Instead, though, the battle pass implementation has been one of the worst I’ve seen in a game for a long time – possibly ever. \r\n\nLet’s set the scene. Overwatch is dead. There’s no going back to the original game, now; it is offline, supplanted and replaced wholly by Overwatch 2. The way you used to earn cosmetics and goods for your various heroes – by opening loot boxes and getting randomised rewards – has been replaced with two tracks of a battle pass (one paid, one free).\n Read more",

Hopefully not while driving… Unless you wanna take your gamer credentials to a whole other, almost certainly illegal, level.\nThis doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to plug a Dualsense or Xbox pad into your car. No, instead the new gaming collection will be played via a connected Smartphone and the in-built Curved Display.

So Mythic WoW Raiders, Warzone demons, and Rocket League zoomers may not be the target audience here. \nLooking at the AirConsole website, it’s clear this is the responsible family’s gaming option. Titles like Brawlanders, Golfriends, Monkey Business and almost 180 more titles clearly appeal to a younger crowd who’d otherwise be causing havoc in the back seats. However, Drunk Casino is the clear winner for me, and sounds like the perfect title for me while I’m headed to work. If I owned a BMW, or a car, or could drive.\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s felt like DLSS has been in the process of becoming an irreplaceable tentpole feature of graphical video game presentation for a while now. As more games adopt the feature and its similar equivalents from other companies, it becomes ever harder to justify turning it off – and with some tasty demos for its latest iteration, Nvidia appears to be truly upping the ante. \nDLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, and it’s a clever AI-assisted feature that essentially allows you to get higher frame rates in games without having to sacrifice their visual fidelity. A game that might only run at 30 frames per second in regular settings could previously often be cranked up to over 60fps with DLSS enabled – and with DLSS 3.0, Nvidia aims to crank the gains up even further.\nThe way DLSS works is pretty simple. AI models are trained on the visuals of games, meaning that the AI can effectively upscale a game with such accuracy in its fidelity that it’s near-enough indistinguishable from the game natively running at a much higher resolution. Running at a lower initial resolution is helpful for settings, however, allowing you to crank up all those delicious PC gaming graphics toggles to max – including ray tracing, the transformative lighting feature that also has a habit of tanking frame rates.\r\n \nRead more",

While the gameplay changes (or lack thereof) remain a hot button topic right now among the community, it’s the new battle pass system that really has people riled up, with some even looking back at the loot boxes of Overwatch 1 with newfound fondness.\nBut what exactly is this new system and why has it got people mad. Well, Overwatch 2 has replaced the old method of unlocking new content — a combination of free and premium loot boxes that contained skins — with a traditional battle pass that has become all the rage over the past few years. This pass contains skins, sprays, voice lines and yes, even new heroes…\nLet’s start with that final point, a real rough spot for some among the Overwatch 2 player base. If you buy the premium pass right now, you get the newest character (Kiriko) right away. Bam! However, if you stick to the free pass, you’ll need to progress through 55 levels of the system before you can play the featured hero. Considering Overwatch is an FPS focused around counterpicks and team composition, this isn’t too great for those who want to dive straight into competitive matches. Not to mention, new characters previously were given out for free.\n Read more",

Lego obsessed from the moment I held my first set, I’ve nevertheless felt that Lego video games have more often than not deliberately dodged or accidentally avoided the freedom of expression and creativity that these magical little bricks allow in the real world. When a game embraces that angle, it’s often gold, as was the case for many of the classic Lego games of the nineties. In Lego Bricktales, we finally have another such game – and it’s brilliant.\r\n\nBricktales is a clever, casual, and devilishly challenging experience. It’s a low-key genre mash-up bringing together puzzle-solving curios with light adventure and exploration elements. Rather than a franchise tie-in action game where the Lego aesthetic is… well, an aesthetic, here it’s at the heart of the experience: this is a game about building.\r\n\nBricktales essentially takes place inside small dioramas, many of which are based on classic Lego themes like Pirates, Castles, and Theme Parks. Your protagonist travels through this world with a superpower: the ability to build. Your job is to travel through each of the game’s stages by building items and structures that’ll help solve puzzles and open up new areas. Along the way, you’ll also acquire a few non-building abilities and tackle some light traversal puzzles.\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s safe to say that Overwatch 2 hasn’t had the smoothest launch since its release on October 4. On launch, servers were at full capacity while simultaneously being hit with DDoS attacks, meaning it was a long wait to get into a game you might be disconnected from. \nThen, Blizzard removed its controversial SMS Protect system (for Overwatch 1 players) that was also locking out some players from jumping into all the action. There was a chat bug that saw players accidentally making purchases, and Bastion’s ultimate is completely broken.\nUltimately, Overwatch 2 is the latest in a long line of terrible game launches, beyond the initial grudges we had against the queues.\n Read more",

In case you’re not shaking in your boots, screaming and soiling yourself in hype, this means you can claim some super rad free stuff on PC versions of certain PlayStation titles. Snark and sarcasm aside, this marks the latest step in Sony’s invasion of the PC platform.\nYou want an example of some of the perks? How about Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles Morales buddy? If you link together your Steam and PSN accounts, you can claim some cosmetics and in-game bonuses including the Resilient Suit, and early unlock of the Concussive Blast, and two skills points. \nBut what else does this mean, aside from Miles Morales players getting a nice little boost if they decide to pick up the game on the PC right now. Well, as briefly mentioned earlier, it’s a rather major milestone in Sony’s slow but steady trudge onto the platform. We’ve seen it make pushes here and there with services like PlayStation Now allowing you to play games like Bloodborne on PC for a while now, but this newfound connectivity adds some extra justification for porting over Sony’s biggest titles to the platform.\n Read more",

          "description": "Overwatch 2 players are coming under fire a tad more than usual right now, thanks to a bug that allows Bastion to infinitely shoot their ultimate until their ultimate timer runs out. While you’re usually only able to use it three times before you’re kicked out, this glitch allows Bastion mains in the know to unload shot after shot for up to eight seconds — more than enough time to clear out an objective or kill most of a team.\nWhat’s worse is that it’s easily reproducible. To fire off a shot, you can use one of two inputs. The trick is to use your left click / right trigger for the first two shots, before pressing both inputs at the same time for each consecutive shot afterwards. On PC this means using left click and Q at the same time, although some have been rebinding their left click input to other keys to make the bug that much easier to reproduce.\nThe result? An otherwise underwhelming ultimate for a typical subpar Overwatch hero is currently causing havoc online. Regardless of your hero or what role you’re filling, an endless stream of high-damage shells is enough to wipe out anyone, and while eight seconds might not sound like a lot, it’s more than enough time to blow through the vast majority of the enemy team.\n Read more",

          "description": "MutliVersus game director, Tony Huynh, has made a habit of teasing or outright announcing future changes to the game via social media, a practice that has frankly established a strong link between the development team and the community over the past few months since launch. However, a recent Tweet has sent the community spiralling. Some, seemingly overjoyed! Others, very worried.\nThis change is a hard limit to the number of times you can use the same move in a combo, an effort to clamp down on “infinites”. These refer to combos that can — in theory — go on forever, unless the opposing player falls away from the blows or the attacking player suffers from a moment of input error. While current anti-infinite systems are in place, which drastically lowers the damage of repeated moves in the same combo, a hard combo breaker would drastically affect the ability to perform extended attack strings.\nSo, first things first, who does this affect the most? Well, certain characters have had long winded combos that use repeated moves  — and yes, even infinites — for some time now. Harley Quinn and Superman are the most prevalent, able to combo players from spawn to ludicrously high percentages and even straight up kills. \n Read more",

According to one indie developer though, outright \"uncensored nudes,\" won't be allowed on the eShop.\r\n\n\r\nPublisher Gamuzumi recently confirmed that one of the games it's publishing, Hot Tentacles Shoot, would not be coming to Switch for the time being (thanks, Nintendo Everything). According to Gamuzumi, the reason for the game not being allowed on the eShop is that \"obscene content could damage the brand and infringe its policies.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It’s difficult to believe, but today marks ten years since XCOM: Enemy Unknown was first released. A lot has changed in the world of gaming in the ensuing decade ⁠— but for my money, Firaxis’ vision of a modern XCOM game remains the best video game franchise reboot there’s ever been. \nStill the high bar for a video game remake, Enemy Unknown reimagines 1994’s X-COM: UFO Defense, dropping the dash in the name and dragging this unique strategy game, originally developed by MicroProse, into the modern age.\nWhat makes XCOM brilliant is honestly a matter of sorcery ⁠— or, perhaps chemistry, if we’re being a little less romantic. The point is this: XCOM: Enemy Unknown is that rare pitch perfect game that threads the needle that any video game remake or reboot faces brilliantly. It kept that which made the original a beloved and fondly remembered cult classic, but took informative cues and ideas from games released in the interim. Many games have tried this, of course, but few have been so resoundingly successful at making it all work. \n Read more",

On the box the Crash 4 Steam release was teased with the text \"Aku Aku's Steam-in Pizza Shack,\" before just outright saying it's coming to the store October 18. But a teaser on the side of the box is potentially hinting at the reveal of the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League.\r\n\n\r\nIf you haven't heard of Wumpa League before, there have been rumours surrounding the game for quite a while, with some concept art for the game having been shared earlier this year by DidYouKnowGaming's Liam Robertson. The reason some suspect that Wumpa League will be revealed at The Game Awards is a line of text on the side of the box that reads, \"Hungry for more?

You’re pressing the skin of your face to the inside of a locker, eyeing up that terminal, knowing it’s less than 20 feet away, probably. But, moments ago, you heard the telltale ding of sinew on metal. The Xenomorph is nearby. And it’s waiting for you to make your move.\r\n\nTime is running out. Both in the game, and in your real life – you need to save, and get on with that article you’re supposed to be writing. So you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and try to slink out of the little cupboard you’ve crammed yourself into as quietly as possible. A glance at your motion tracker seems to suggest you’re safe. Footsteps echoing through the deserted Sevastopol station. Breath ragged in your ears. The blinking light of the terminal closing in. Your hand on the machine. Then – fuck – it’s coming up and out of your chest. Its tail, tearing through your ribs, your lungs. That’s it. Game over, Ripley. \nSome may argue that this is appalling game design, making you gamble on whether or not you can actually save your game. You can lose hours of progress if you mess up your timing, if you gamble against Ripley’s ability to stay alive.

The app, according to EA, is \"faster, more reliable, and more streamlined\" than Origin, and will be the \"best possible place\" to experience the company's games, services and content.\nWith the app, you can automatically download games and background updates, and build your friends list by connecting your EA account to other platforms and services like Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. Each user will also have a custom and unique ID, and once connected to the app, users will know what and when friends are playing, allowing players to jump in and game together.\n Read more",

          "description": "^Stay tuned after the ads for my full RAILGRADE review and enjoy some beautiful ultrawide footage while you’re at it.\n\n\r\nIt’s not often that video games set out to mimic small things. Photorealism tends to depict the world at a scale that humans can walk around in. But, swivelling a macro-lens onto that Unreal Engine camera and pointing it at digital miniatures produces a wonderful effect that makes RAILGRADE’s otherwise fairly standard route plan puzzling an absolute joy to get stuck into.\r\n\n\r\nIn short, it’s transportive. For me, it throws me right back to my childhood bedroom, where a constantly reconfigured TOMY train set enjoyed permanent residence on the floor, forever delivering assorted handfuls of lego bricks between the Ghostbusters fire station and a permanently downed Star Trek: The Next Generation shuttlecraft. Who knows why. The mind of a ten year-old is unknowable, even if you were one.\r\n \nRead more",

We’re already well aware of what’s in store, and that’s various adjustments to make the game welcoming for newcomers or returning players, or simply more engaging for veterans who believe they’ve done it all.\nThis includes a relaxed mode, and a survival mode, both of which offer easier and harder difficulties depending on what type of player you are. On top of that, there’s performance improvements, increased inventory space, and of course, perhaps the biggest accompaniment of the whole 4.0 update, the space-exploration title has finally arrived on Nintendo Switch.\nThat said, those playing the game on Nintendo Switch will not only be able to explore the vast expanse of space with responsive touch controls in handheld mode, they’ll also be able to bag themselves some freebies for supporting Hello Games’ survival game on the handheld. \n Read more",

          "description": "EGX was two weeks ago, which is wild. Time has really flown by. But, there’s one game there that’s really stuck in my mind as of late — especially as I've been kicking my heels in Overwatch 2 queues and looking for a quick, competitive FPS fix in the downtime. Enter Squad Blast, which has fixed itself onto me ever since I got my hands on it back in London. It’s got the spirit of Overwatch and CS:GO, but all excitingly represented on a 2D plane. As a result, it really is quite brilliant.\nI spent a good chunk of my time at EGX messing around with Squad Blast, and was fortunate enough to interview Anatolijs Ropotovs – CEO and founder of Ultrahorse – about the inspirations for the title, what the studio is hoping to achieve, and why it thinks players will hop over from some of the genre’s big hitters and try out this fresh, more 2D approach.\nSquad Blast is a team-based competitive shooter, where you and your partner set out to outsmart and outgun the enemy team within short, punchy objective-based matches. It’s hero-based, which means different characters have different weapons and abilities, and even in my short hour-or-so playing it at the show I could feel the counter-pick meta bubbling behind the scenes. The sniper dominates mid-ranged rocket users, the shotgun beats out the sniper, and the rocket is damn good at cutting off offensive shotgun pushes. You can play defensive, you can play offensive, but you’ve absolutely got to play well... otherwise you’ll see the clear difference between yourself and your opponents. Like in any good competitive title.\n Read more",

          "description": "About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.\r\n\n\r\nI was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One is Bethesda’s first instalment of their take on the retro-futuristic post-apocalypse in Fallout 3. There’s also Shiro Games’ ode to classic console RPGs, the Evoland series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.\r\n\n\r\nHighlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It's very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it.

Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I'm sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We're still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I'd imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I'll keep you posted as soon as we've got more to share on it.\nThings that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year's list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I'm looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won't want to miss it.\nRead more",

These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?\nTurns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they'll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival.

          "description": "Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65\" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my \"Do I like Persona 5?\" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm \"No, mate, you don't\". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.\n\n \nRead more",

Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.\nNow? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it's the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm.

You've likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious \"standing on your own shoulders\" uses.\nThe balancing of all that didn't quite work for me, but I'm generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you're more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.\nRead more",

Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next.

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a \"domestic Joker\".\nThe developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.\nRead more",

I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.\nThat’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.\nRead more",

          "description": "I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee's recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as \"extremely relevant to [my] interests\". So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)\nRomancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.\nThe demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)\n Read more",

The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).\nThat's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.\nRead more",

With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. \nThe best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers. \nRead more",

A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies.

          "description": "Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths' interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. \r\n\n\r\nLike him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the \"church mystery\" or \"sadfutago's posts\", among other monikers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That one! The one with the robots and the Soviet Alien dot detector thing!\" The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year's E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I've now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don't much like the look of that there laser bot.\nRead more",

They say it's faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn't really matter, as long as it's not a disaster, because it's not like you're using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.\nRead more",

(And what does sunweaver have to do with it?)\nWith Ubuntu Touch, the UBports Foundation offers a truly unique mobile experience - a viable alternative to Android and iOS. The UBports community provides a free and open-source GNU/Linux-based mobile operating system. One that can be installed and used today.\nCurrently, there is an intensive effort going on lifting Ubuntu Touch from its current Ubuntu 16.04 base up to an Ubuntu 20.04 base. (And very soon after that to an Ubuntu 22.04 base...).\nWith the Ubuntu Touch 20.04 base the progress bar is already at (I'd say) 89%, but we recently got hit by a drawback.\nI am currently involved in the Ubuntu Touch core development team at UBports and on medium short notice our current ARM64 server sponsor has announced to decommission our ARM64 build server that currently powers all the ARM64 and armhf CI builds.\nCall for Hardware Sponsoring\nSo, the UBports core development team is currently desperately looking for a sponsor (or a few sponsors) who can provide us with (datacenter-hosted) ARM-based CPU power. It is important, that also 32-bit ARM builds are possible with the hardware provided.\nFor testing, I recently ordered a HoneyComb LX2 (by SolidRun) as a possible solution (multi-node in the end), but the board arrived in a non-usable state, it seems. So this also didn't work out as easy as expected.\nAs the former provider/sponsor is about to pull the plug, this call for help is kind of urgent. \nPlease get in touch if you can help us out or know people who can.\nThanks!!!",

The best-case performance is ‘faster than CPU speed’ as use of parallel SIMD instructions and careful branch avoidance can lead to less than one cpu cycle per byte parsed; see the video of the talk by Daniel Lemire at QCon.\nThis release simply changes one statement to not trigger a warning under clang++-14.\nThe very short NEWS entry for this release follows.\nChanges in version 0.1.8 (2022-10-18)\nUse the '||' operator instead of '|' on a set of booleans to appease 'clang-14'.\nCourtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for this release.

It integrates closely with other Arch Linux tooling like updpkgsums that’s already used to pin the content of build inputs in PKGBUILD.\nTo use this, the downstream lockfile becomes an additional source input in the source= array of our PKGBUILD (this is already the case for some packages).\n\nsource=(\"git+https://github.com/vimeo/psalm.git#commit=${_commit}\"\n        \"composer.lock\")\n\n\nYou would then add a new function named updlockfiles that can generate new lockfiles and copies them into $outdir, and a prepare function to copy the lockfile in the right place:\n\n prepare() {\n   cd ${pkgname}\n   cp ../composer.lock .\n}\n\nupdlockfiles() {\n  cd ${pkgname}\n  rm -f composer.lock\n  composer update\n  cp composer.lock \"${outdir}/\"\n}\n\n\nTo update the package to the latest (compatible) patch level simply run:\n\nupdlockfiles\n\n\nThis can also be used in case upstreams lockfile has vulnerable dependencies that you want to patch downstream. For more detailed instructions see the readme.\nThanks\nThis work is currently crowd-funded on github sponsors.

          "description": "In November 2021 I filed a feature request for the fish shell to add underscore as a thousand separator in\nnumbers. My feature request has been implemented and is available\nin fish 3.5.0, released 16 June 2022.\nThe fish shell supports mathematical operations using the math command.\nedward@x1c9 ~> math 2_000 + 22\n2022\nedward@x1c9 ~> \n\n\n\nThe underscore can be used as a thousand separator, but there are other uses for a number separator. Here's a list taken\nfrom a post by Mathias Bynens about the number separator in JavaScript:\n// A decimal integer literal with its digits grouped per thousand:\n1_000_000_000_000\n// A decimal literal with its digits grouped per thousand:\n1_000_000.220_720\n// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per octet:\n0b01010110_00111000\n// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per nibble:\n0b0101_0110_0011_1000\n// A hexadecimal integer literal with its digits grouped by byte:\n0x40_76_38_6A_73\n// A BigInt literal with its digits grouped per thousand:\n4_642_473_943_484_686_707n \n\n\n\nProgramming languages are gradually adding a number separator to their syntax, I think Perl was the first. Most are\nlanguages use underscore, but C++ 14 uses an apostrophe for the number separator.",
