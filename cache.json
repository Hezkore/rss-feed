          "description": "As you may know, email spoofing allows attackers to pose as someone else to gain illegal profit. For example, I only use webmaster@cyberciti.biz for communication, but someone might create a spoofed-up email, say info@opensourceflare.com, to trick someone. This is called email spoofing with fake headers as follow:\nDate: Thu, 24 Oct 2021 12:46:10 \r\nFrom: nixCraft <info@opensourceflare.com>\r\nReply-To: info@opensourceflare-email.com\r\nTo: <my@personal_gmail_com>\nCorrect headers are often not checked by receiving email servers, and my@personal_gmail_com may think the email is from me. Here is the thing I don't use opensourceflare.com for email communication at all. So how do I prevent illegitimate email traffic on my domain? In this tutorial, I will explain how to configure DNS settings that tell receiving email servers this domain is not configured for emailing purposes and the attacker maliciously sending email on my behalf.\nLove this? sudo share_on: Twitter - Facebook - LinkedIn - Whatsapp - Reddit\nThe post DNS settings to avoid email spoofing and phishing for unused domain appeared first on nixCraft.",

However, you still need to block USB device access. We can configure a Linux desktop security policy to protect your computer against rogue USB devices (a.k.a. BadUSB) by implementing essential allow and blocklisting capabilities based on device attributes. For instance, I can deﬁne what kind of USB devices are authorized and how a USB device interacts with the Linux system. For example, I can define policy allowing Yubikey with serial number \"XYZ\" and USB LTE modem with serial # \"ABC.\" Every other USB device access is denied by default.\nLove this? sudo share_on: Twitter - Facebook - LinkedIn - Whatsapp - Reddit\nThe post How to protect Linux against rogue USB devices using USBGuard appeared first on nixCraft.",

          "description": "\"For more than a decade, Google has been baking and eating its own homemade Linux desktop distribution,\" writes Computerworld. \n\nLong-time Slashdot reader waspleg shared their report:\n\nThe first version was Goobuntu. (As you'd guess from the name, it was based on Ubuntu.) In 2018, Google moved its in-house Linux desktop from the Goobuntu to a new Linux distro, the Debian-based gLinux. Why? Because, as Google explained, Ubuntu's Long Term Support (LTS) two-year release \"meant that we had to upgrade every machine in our fleet of over 100,000 devices before the end-of-life date of the OS.\" \n\nThat was a pain. Add in the time-consuming need to fully customize engineers' PCs, and Google decided that it cost too much. Besides, the \"effort to upgrade our Goobuntu fleet usually took the better part of a year. With a two-year support window, there was only one year left until we had to go through the same process all over again for the next LTS. This entire process was a huge stress factor for our team, as we got hundreds of bugs with requests for help for corner cases.\" \n\nSo, when Google had enough of that, it moved to Debian Linux (though not just vanilla Debian). The company created a rolling Debian distribution: GLinux Rolling Debian Testing (Rodete). The idea is that users and developers are best served by giving them the latest updates and patches as they're created and deemed ready for production. \nGoogle's using what appears to be an automated build system (along with virtualized test suites, and eventually \"incremental canarying\"), the article points out. The end result? \n\n\"The entire gLinux development team consists of a single on-duty release engineer position that rotates among team members.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

          "description": "waspleg writes: Fedora, the popular Linux distribution, will no longer incorporate software licensed under CC0, the Creative Commons \"No Rights Reserved\" license. In order to support the wide re-use of copyrighted content in new works, CC0 provides authors \"a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law.\" The license arose in response to the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extended the duration of copyright by 20 years at the expense of the public domain. But CC0 explicitly says the licensor does not waive patent rights, which for free and open source software (FOSS) is a potential problem. That means, for instance as described here, if you use CC0-licensed code in your project, and the author of that code later claims your project is infringing a patent they own regarding that code, your defense will be limited. Avoiding the use of CC0-licensed code is one way to steer clear of these so-called submarine patents that could years later torpedo you. \n\nIn a message to The Fedora Project's mailing list for legal issues, Richard Fontana, a technology lawyer for Red Hat (which sponsors Fedora), explained that while CC0 is cited as a \"good license,\" it won't be for much longer. \"We plan to classify CC0 as allowed-content only, so that CC0 would no longer be allowed for code,\" said Fontana. \"This is a fairly unusual change and may have an impact on a nontrivial number of Fedora packages (that is not clear to me right now), and we may grant a carveout for existing packages that include CC0-covered code.\" Fontana said there's a growing consensus in the FOSS community that licenses without any form of patent licensing or forbearance aren't suitable. CC0, he said, like other Creative Commons licenses, includes a clause that explicitly states no patent rights are waived by the licensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

          "description": "IBM saw its hybrid-cloud revenue jump 18% to $5.9 billion in the last three months, reports ZDNet — while also experiencing \"its highest sales growth in a decade. \n\n\"Much of that is due to its stand-alone Red Hat division.\"\n\nTrue, Red Hat sales increased by \"only\" 12%, which is low by Red Hat standards but darn good by any other standard. So what will Red Hat do now that it has a new CEO, Matt Hicks, and chairman, Paul Cormier? \n\nThe answer: Stay the course. \n\nIn an interview, Hicks, who's been with Red Hat since 2006, said, \"[We'll keep using] the same core fundamentals that we built 20-plus years ago.\" Why? Because the combination of Linux, open-source software, and top support, \"continues to play in new markets, whether that's the shift to cloud and cloud services or to edge computing. In the next couple of quarters. we'll just focus on executing. There's great momentum right now around the open hybrid cloud.\" \n\n\nIt's not just the cloud, though. Hicks continued, \"We have a lot of opportunities. We're also working with General Motors on Ultifi, GM's end-to-end software platform, and two days ago, we announced a partnership with ABB, one of the world's leading manufacturing automation companies. It's pretty cool to see Linux and open source technologies being pulled into these totally new markets in the industry. So my job is not to change anything but keep us executing and capturing the opportunities ahead....\" \n\nMoving to the technical side, I asked about Red Hat and CentOS. Hicks replied, \"I think it was a necessary shift and change. I'm a big believer in what makes open source work is the contribution cycle, and that wasn't happening with CentOS.\" \n\nCormier adds that going forward Linux's biggest contribution to the world may be innovation (and not accessbility), \"and that needs contributions. Without it driving open source and Linux, the cloud wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

Ubuntu-certified devices are based on Long Term Support (LTS) releases and therefore receive updates for up to 10 years. So if you actually still have an XPS 13 that came with Ubuntu back in the day, it's still supported today. [...] Dell and Canonical have been at this for years. Today's Dell's Developer Editions are the official continuation of Project Sputnik. This initiative began 10 years ago to create high-end Dell systems with Ubuntu preinstalled. These were, and are, designed with programmer input and built for developers.\n \nAs Jaewook Woo, Dell's product manager, Linux, explained: \"XPS is an innovation portal for Dell -- from its application of cutting-edge technology to experimentation of new user interfaces and experiential design. By bringing the enhanced performance and power management features of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to our most advanced premium laptop, Dell and Canonical reinforce our joint commitment to continue delivering the best computing experience for developers using Ubuntu.\"\n \nThe forthcoming Dell XPS Plus Developer Edition's specifications are impressive. The base configuration is powered by a 12th-generation Intel i5 1240P processor that runs up to 4.4GHz. For graphics, it uses Intel Iris Xe Graphics.

          "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Unlike Intel Macs, Apple silicon Macs were designed to run only Apple's software. But the developers on the Asahi Linux team have been working to change that, painstakingly reverse-engineering support for Apple's processors and other Mac hardware and releasing it as a work-in-progress distro that can actually boot up and run on bare metal, no virtualization required. The Asahi Linux team put out a new release today with plenty of additions and improvements. Most notably, the distro now supports the M1 Ultra and the Mac Studio and has added preliminary support for the M2 MacBook Pro (which has been tested firsthand by the team) and the M2 MacBook Air (which hasn't been tested but ought to work). Preliminary Bluetooth support for all Apple silicon Macs has also been added, though the team notes that it works poorly when connected to a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network because \"Wi-Fi/Bluetooth coexistence isn't properly configured yet.\"\n \nThere are still many other things that aren't working properly, including the USB-A ports on the Studio, faster-than-USB-2.0 speeds from any Type-C/Thunderbolt ports, and GPU acceleration, but progress is being made on all of those fronts. GPU work in particular is coming along, with a \"prototype driver\" that is \"good enough to run real graphics applications and benchmarks\" already up and running, though it's not included in this release. The Asahi team has said in the past that it expects support for new chips to be relatively easy to add to Asahi since Apple's chip designers frequently reuse things and don't make extensive hardware changes unless there's a good reason for it. Adding basic support for the M2 to Asahi happened over the course of a single 12-hour development session, and just \"a few days\" of additional effort were needed to get the rest of the hardware working as well as it does with M1-based Macs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

For more details, visit the Matrix discussion page. \n\nBesides, it's worth mentioning that Arch Linux already have the Cutefish desktop packages in the community repo. You can even install it as a standalone desktop environment in Arch Linux with easy steps. As you can see, it is easier to maintain the desktop environment to continue its development because the structure is already out there. \n\nI have tested and reviewed hundreds of distros for years, and Cutefish OS is the promising one with its stunning desktop environment. It was written from the ground up with QML and C++ and took advantage of KWin. It would have been an attractive desktop as a separate component and could have been another great option besides KDE Plasma or GNOME. \n\nMany open-source projects are born and die every year, and it's unfortunate to see the situation of Cutefish OS. I hope an official fork comes up soon, and we all can contribute to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

MNT Research introduces a \"more affordable\" 7-inch mini Linux laptop, the MNT Pocket Reform.\n KDE's Slimbook 4 is here with AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor and a better battery, starting from $1,000. \"Buying from Slimbook supports KDE development too,\" notes Gaming on Linux, adding that there's a choice of 14 or 15.6 inch displays. TUXEDO's Pulse 15 — Gen2 (also with an AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor) has a 15-inch HiDPI WQHD 165Hz display, along with eight cores and 16 threads. (And the Register notes its twin cooling fans, \"allowing them to overclock the chip and run it at 35W,\" and a choice of distros.)\nPre-orders have opened for the Roma — the first RISC-V Laptop (which may ship in September). Ars Technica reports they're offering \"free Silicon upgrades\" — that is free system-on-a-chip and system-on-module upgrades for its quad-core RISC-V CPU. And there's also a companion NPU/GPU, notes a blog post at RISCV.org, \"for the fastest, seamless RISC-V native software development available.\" (As well as \"early access to next-generation laptop and accessory upgrades at generous discounts or for free.\") The blog post calls it a \"Web3-friendly platform with NFT creation and publication plus integrated MetaMask-style wallet.\" System 76's \"Lemur\" Alder Lake- and coreboot-powered laptop arrives with 14 hours of battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

          "description": "System76, the Colorado-based Linux laptop, desktop, and server specialist, has announced a new highly portable laptop with an Intel Alder Lake processor inside. Tom's Hardware reports: The new Lemur Pro(opens in new tab) is a \"lighter than Air\" 14-inch form factor laptop with excellent battery life and attractions such as open firmware (powered by Coreboot) and a 180-degree hinge. In addition, buyers can choose to go with Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS pre-installed. The new Lemur Pro has many attractive modern features you might see advertised in many rival mainstream thin and light designs. However, the special sauce here is the \"System76 Open Firmware with Coreboot.\" Coreboot, known initially as LinuxBIOS, is significant as it is an open-source BIOS implementation embraced by Linux users. It is lightweight, flexible, and feature-rich. [...]\n \nSystem76 has designed the Lemur Pro with monitor-based docking in mind. It envisions users connecting to a big screen using the USB-C connection to benefit from the more expansive workspace and laptop charging. Like Windows, Linux had to have some serious tinkering under the hood to prepare for the mix of Performance and Efficiency cores in Alder Lake chips. However, rest assured, efficient hybrid scheduling is taken care of with the two OS options that can be pre-installed on the Lemur Pro.\n \nSystem76 allows customers to configure and buy Lemur Pro laptops right now. There are many RAM and storage configurations to pick through, and you can add external keyboards and monitors to the bundle. The entry price with an Intel Core i5-1235U, 8GB RAM, 240GB of storage, and no extras is $1,149. However, the Core i7-1255U model is a bit of a stretch, adding $200 to the base price for the faster CPU clocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",
