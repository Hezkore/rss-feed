        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Insomniac Games' formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port's system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn't immediately obvious, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac's original Marvel's Spider-Man, taking the first game's acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


"Insomniac's second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original," said Eurogamer's Martin Robinson wrote in his Recommended review, "but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It's a game that's full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's PS5 has generated £919 million in the UK, with 2 million units sold since it was made available in 2020.
The figure makes it the fourth console in the region to make it to that figure. The first on the list is Wii, followed by PS2 and PS4, respectively, with PS5 and PS3 coming in even at 98 weeks (thanks, GI.biz).
Yet, PS5 is number one when it comes to money, even though its sales performance has been marred by stock shortages. Compared to PS5, Wii generated £358 million at two million unit sales, PS4 £700 million, and Xbox One generated £726 million with 2 million unit sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to "region-hopping" - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

From now until October 18, the Hoops event is live which, instead of revelling in the lovely, relaxing, embracing football we’ve grown, we’ve gotten another basketball arena. I’m shaking.
That’s right, with a new arena called “The Block”, players will be able to shoot balls into — get this — large circular hoops at each side of the arena, as opposed to the smaller, elegant goals Rocket League is known for.
There’s more! With the new arena and event there’s challenges are rewards to dive — or drive — into. Rewards include the illustrious new game time player anthem, and the animated double dribble topper. What a mouthful, and one you’ll want to nab before the event goes forever.

This is hard for Matthew, because he hates the environment (unless his immediate environment contains a can of Rio).
Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

Entering the same crowded marketplace that includes behemoths like Destiny and Warframe, and the corpses of high-profile failures like Anthem, must be a daunting prospect. But Korean developers Nexon have gone and done it anyway, and the result is The First Descendant, an extremely “one of those sorts of games” effort that seems to blend elements from every single one of its genre contemporaries into a sort of gloop.


And, look, gloop isn’t necessarily a bad thing, right? Everyone likes gloop. Custard. Rice pudding. Angel delight. Dessert metaphors aside, the thing about The First Descendant is that it feels almost aggressively mid: intent, almost, on existing as a mathematical average of all these other games instead of actively trying to carve out a niche of its own.

As part of the deal, Nintendo must also display a notice informing employees (in block capital letters) they "WILL NOT" be fired or stopped from discussing unionisation.

The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as "The Springfield Files."

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer's conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner's Waterworld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

We can't give a timeframe on a new release date right now, but as soon as we are in a position to do so, we will let everyone know and we thank the community for their continued support and understanding," reads a press release.

The video goes over whether or not the game can be considered "hard sci-fi", how games such as Sundog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller inspired the team behind Starfield, and how the fuel in your ship and the gravity drive limits how far you can go at once.
It's all very interesting, but one of the biggest talking points in the video relates to the trait and dialogue systems.

Now, in light of this news, the developer behind top-down party battle game and Google Stadia exclusive Outcasters has informed its players that, at this point in time, it "does not have plans to bring [the game] to other platforms".


In a statement on Twitter, British developer Splash Damage explained that as Outcasters was both designed and built with Stadia specifically in mind, the game's systems were "heavily reliant on the platform" and the work required to release it on a different platform was simply too complex at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlatinumGames hasn’t exactly had the hottest streak lately. Babylon’s Fall was an exemplary lesson in how not to do a service game, it lost the job of making Granblue Fantasy: Relink to Cygames back in 2019, and even Astral Chain failed to really get the traction you’d see from keystone series like Bayonetta or Nier. The studio, regrettably, has been stuck in a rut.


But, with Bayonetta 3, Platinum comes dancing and jiving out of this lull in an explosion of keratin and Umbran magic. From the opening minutes – no, the opening seconds – Bayonetta 3 says “the witch is back, darling” and kicks any and all of your expectations to the curb. The languid pace of Astral Chain’s opening hours have been forgotten, the sub-par combat and service model of Babyon’s Fall cast aside; this is Platinum firing on all cylinders once again. And, damn, does it feel good.


Everything you remember about Bayonetta and its sequel is present and accounted for: the razor-sharp combat, the best-in-class Witch Time dodging, the frantic-yet-measured melee, the over-the-top set pieces. Yet, somehow, Bayonetta 3 takes everything from the first two games that made you grin like a gremlin and dials it up even more.

        <updated>2022-10-13T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since it sprung from the remnants of Capcom's Clover Studios back in 2007, PlatinumGames has become synonymous with a certain brand of over-the-top action; think the knee-sliding shotgun ballet of Vanquish, the stylish sucker punch of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance or the madcap superhero adventure of The Wonderful 101. Throughout all that there's been one constant - the devilish and daring Bayonetta, as close as the Osaka studio has as an official mascot, who's finally on the cusp of her third outing. Having played a sizable chunk of Bayonetta 3, all signs are pointing towards it being her best yet too. 


Like previous entries, this is an action game cast firmly in the mould of Devil May Cry (Devil May Cry creator Hideki Kamiya returns here as executive director for Bayonetta 3), with whip-quick third-person combat at its core. Unlike something like Devil May Cry 5, however, which saw Capcom retool and refine that core combat towards something like perfection, Bayonetta 3 builds outwards in a work of maximalist beauty. This is a game that throws in the kitchen sink, the dishwasher and tumble dryer and just about anything it can at you, and the result is intoxicating if never exactly coherent. 


There's only two sections we're free to discuss in this last preview before we give the final verdict, but they illustrate the point perfectly well. First, we've a gauntlet run through modern-day Tokyo with Bayonetta herself, summoned into the real world through an oh-so-fashionable multiverse hook. What it means, in practice, is getting to see Bayonetta transposed onto something like real-life, racing through a city that's being destroyed by a colossal shark demon as she surfs atop the giant dragon Gomorrah, crashing along spiralling skyscrapers before donning cruise liners for a set of impromptu water skates. Bayonetta 3, in case you hadn't already guessed, does not trade in subtlety.

The surprising U-turn comes after esports were piloted at the 2022 Games held in Birmingham. 


The pilot was co-funded by the Commonwealth Games Federation (GF) and the Global Esports Federation (GEF). At the time, the CGF called the pilot a success and expected esports to be held at future Games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fantasy construction sim Dwarf Fortress is, by the admission of its designers, difficult to learn and even harder to master. That’s why the game’s Steam version will have its own tutorial. Co-creator Zach Adams has roped in a novice playtester to try the tutorial out, in the form of his wife Annie. Annie bounced off the original, not-so-visually-appealing version of Dwarf Fortress. Yet, says Adams, the tutorial seems to be working to help Annie ease into the game at last.

Since launch, the console has been hampered with stock shortage issues and remains in high demand. That's despite a price increase for UK consumers of £30 back in August, which Sony blamed on inflation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FromSoftware rolled out a big new update for Elden Ring following server maintenance. This is the game's first patch since August, and it arrived earlier this morning on all platforms.
Update 1.07's biggest new addition is separating PvP balance from single-player and co-op. In other words, scaling for weapons, skills, spells etc. will now have different values in PvP in order to better balance the experience.
Patch 1.07 heralds the start of this approach to balance, and it's the one FromSoft will be relying on moving forward. As a result, today's update introduces several balance tweaks that only affect PvP gameplay. Stamina attack power has been increased for all attacks against guarding players, except when using long-ranged weapons.

You can sign up for the program totally for free, granted you have a PlayStation Plus membership.
Here’s how it works.With the launch of PlayStation Stars campaigns will be introduced, which will essentially be limited-time goals and activities players can take part in. Doing so, in addition to collecting trophies from a variety of PlayStation titles, will reward you with points and even shiny digital collectables, which you can place in a new display case on your PlayStation mobile app.
While the collectables aspect is good and all, especially for trophy hunter types who I imagine will be showing off their digital collection to strangers on the bus and train. It’s the points that may really catch your attention though, as they can be exchanged for a variety of genuinely valuable stuff, like whole games and DLC. So, it is like an actual loyalty program, rather than just a dressed-up trophies 2.0.

Raising awareness about the topic of mental health in general is something I am deeping passionate about, and I have lived with mental illnesses myself for some time now. I take a variety of regular medications to help with this, and, combined with cognitive behavioural therapy, these have worked well for me and my ongoing recovery.
While they aren't designed to be therapeutic, games have often provided me with a safe refuge to escape to. This can often include jumping back into a title from my childhood and experiencing that unrivalled nostalgic joy once more (I will forever have a soft spot for The Italian Job on the PlayStation 2 for this very reason).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my clearest lockdown memories is of going for a lunchtime walk with Olaf Stapledon. It was somewhere near the start of things, I think, no cars on the roads and those government mandated exercise breaks still feeling weirdly illicit. There is a stretch of the South Downs behind my house which I am ashamed to say I had never visited until Covid. One morning I set out over the gentle grassy hump of its hill, over the buried spine of the thing, with the almost indescribable vastness of Stapledon's novel Star Maker playing in my headphones.


Star Maker is all about a journey through the cosmos - deep into space and out the other side, really. But that day its wild intergalactic journey actually served to root me more deeply in the landscape I was exploring. I remember the broken chalky earth where the badgers make their sets, the dew pond with its looping swallows, a lonely bench pointed at nothing where I sat in silence for a space of time that was maybe twenty minutes, maybe an hour. I was learning, all the time. Over the course of that morning ramble I learned afresh how to be in nature.


And this is exactly what Paradise Marsh teaches. It's a small game, but also a gigantic one: truly a Stapledonian trick of time and space. I load it up and explore a colourful endless wetlands, cycling through day and night, spring, summer, autumn and winter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has triumphantly termed the recently-released FIFA 23 as "record-breaking" - for hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, and having the "biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history".


FIFA 23 is, of course, also the last EA Sports FIFA franchise release in history - with the series set to transition to EA Sports FC from next year.

This is sometimes called Jerry Seinfeld’s secret to productivity: Just keep at it. Don’t break the streak.
and then showed the first chart of GitHub streaking 366 days:
github activity october 2013 to october 2014


And seven years ago a first follow-up appeared in this post about 731 days:
github activity october 2014 to october 2015


And six years ago we had a followup at 1096 days
github activity october 2015 to october 2016


And five years ago we had another one marking 1461 days
github activity october 2016 to october 2017


And four years ago another one for 1826 days
github activity october 2017 to october 2018


And three years ago another one bringing it to 2191 days
github activity october 2018 to october 2019


And two years ago another one bringing it to 2557 days
github activity october 2019 to october 2020


And last year another one bringing it to 2922 days
github activity october 2020 to october 2021


And as today is October 12 here is the newest one from 2021 to 2022 one bringing it 3287 days:
github activity october 2021 to october 2022

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Starfield's hugely anticipated 2023 release growing ever-closer, Bethesda has launched a new Q&A video series, and episode one sees director Todd Howard responding to a number of community queries - including sharing some thoughts on whether Starfield can be described as a "hard sci-fi" game.


Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield's inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you're wondering - before moving on to tackle the "hard sci-fi" question.


While he admitted the answer will very much depend on an individual's definition of "hard sci-fi", he said, "It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here's how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that".

Over on Nexus, modder DJ_Kovrik has created an Edgerunners-inspired addition that adds a Humanity Cost system for cyberware implants and low Humanity side-effects including cyberpsychosis (thanks, Games Radar).
Wannabe Edgerunner - A Simple Cyberpsychosis Mod basically adds Humanity as a stat. This stat depends on installed cyberware, Berserk/Sandevistan usages, and committed kills. With each implant, your Humanity will permanently decrease while installed.

The CMA also feels it's possible Microsoft could use Activision Blizzard and its other  services to hurt streaming competitors Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.

The original version of Valve's Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it's felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device's respective app stores.


It's most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there's plenty more besides.

Anyway, it's down to £499 today after a £100 discount, so listen up - here's why I rate this monitor so highly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An update to the CD Projekt RED support page outlines how Stadia users can download their Cyberpunk 2077 saves.
With Stadia shutting down in January , folks are understandably worried about their save game files. Those who play Cyberpunk 2077 and want to continue playing their game on another platform, need only do the following using Google Takeout, per CDPR.


Open takeout.google.com.
In the "Create a new export" section click "Deselect all" and select "Stadia". Press "Next Step" to continue.
Choose your preferred destination and “Export once” frequency. Choose ".zip" file type and "2 GB" size. Press "Create Export".
Download the export from the destination chosen in the previous step.
Locate the downloaded archive on your PC. Extract it.
Your Cyberpunk 2077 game saves will be located in the following path: .../Takeout/Stadia/GAMING/GAME_SAVE/
Note that there may be saved files from other games located there as well. 
Files of each game save are located inside archives. Extract them to separate folders.
To use the extracted saves on the PC version, simply copy-paste those folders to the following path: %userprofile%\Saved Games\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077
Make sure that files are not nested inside another folder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Torchlight: Infinite - a new free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android, iOS, and PC.


Torchlight, if you're unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020's Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be a free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3's less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

Honestly, I haven't finished half the games I've bought, and I've long since stopped thinking about 'The Backlog' as if I ever will. But I might enjoy this one week of exploring a gorgeous desert, climbing and gliding and hoverbiking, and you might too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FIFA has launched its first video game venture since its split with EA - a vaguely football-themed Roblox "immersive experience" intended to tie-in with this year's Qatar world cup.


Following the termination of FIFA's partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter's long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, "I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of "non-simulation games" toward the end of this year.

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a "domestic Joker".
The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

I adore its linear mission structure that is completely at odds with the expansive semi-open world shopping mall in which it takes place. Hell, I even like its severely stripped down Wii port. I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks.

Back in the day, comparing RTX 3080 to RTX 2080 showed up some impressive gains - but the performance multipliers are at a new level when considering how the new RTX 4090 stacks up against prior GPU champions RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. In fact, on a broader level, the delivery of so much performance actually poses problems in creating a balanced gaming PC: as you'll see in our analysis, many of the games we're benching are now hitting CPU limitations. Even at 4K resolution. Even at maximum settings. The heaviest of ray tracing workloads though? RTX 4090 is simply phenomenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[^Stay tuned after the ads for our Street Fighter 6 Beta impressions, and loads of pristine PS5 footage.


Fighting games are often fraught with netcode issues, matchmaking discrepancies, and general annoyances that tend to make the online experience a pale shadow of the immediacy and excitement of IRL tournaments, or just hanging around in an arcade in the nineties. This isn’t a problem unique to fighting games, of course: Zoom calls are mince compared to spending proper time with your mates. It is what it is.


Capcom however appear to have nailed many of these issues in the Street Fighter 6 closed beta, which finished on Sunday, and impressed us with its smooth, generally lag-free presentation (even managing to put in a good show over wifi), and a social space that really does feel like hanging around in an arcade, complete with actual machines to sit down at in order to challenge nearby players to bouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has announced it will be ending service for Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier on January 23, 2023.
The company said that despite all its efforts to provide regular updates with new content, it could not deliver the experience it was hoping to and one that players deserved. Therefore, it has decided to end service for the mobile game.
The multiplayer battle royale shooter was released on Android and iOS in November 2021 after extensive testing. Set in Midgar 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy 7, in it you play as one of many Soldier candidates, all vying for survival to prove their worth for the Shira military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Each and every week the game pile grows higher, forming the walls of a virtually impenetrable digital structure known only as the ‘backlog’. As the games multiply, thickening the increasingly cell-like walls of our den of entertainment, we can only gaze on and hope it doesn’t one day become our tomb. On that light note, it’s nice to see that SteamDB now has a section showing what games are coming out on Steam every week.

Below Deck: Mediterranean had me covered last winter (alongside its Sailing Yacht spin-off), as I watched super yacht crew toil to meet the demands of the wealthy and unhinged. Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed "I licked her tit or whatever," in a shock revelation to his betrothed.
What's on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It's on Netflix and I'm convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cultic has really good headshots. I mean, it also has a lot of other things going for it, but it feels rude not to highlight this right at the very top because I think it’s important. Cultic’s headshots are sensational. Enemy noggins pop with a squelchy crack that tickles a very unnerving part of my brain, the resulting blood fountain spraying so high it causes the ceiling to drip with human juice long after your hopeless adversary has slumped to the floor. It’s gross. But. You know. It’s also kind of great.

"Let's try that again," Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra wrote on Twitter last night, sharing a fresh blog post from the developer which apologises - yet again - for the game's troubled arrival and offers a few bits and pieces to cheer fans up.


Overwatch 2 players can look forward to "several Double Match XP weekends" - dates for which will be announced soon. Anyone who logs in this season from 25th October onwards will also get a Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary skin and a Health Pack Weapon Charm, which is nice I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stripe is coming to MultiVersus tomorrow, providing the second big hit of Gremlins love to the platform fighter in recent months. This came suddenly via the official MultiVersus Twitter account, which made the announcement alongside an in-game picture of the little monster.
Stripe has been present in MultiVersus via the menu screen for a little while now, soft announcing the character alongside Black Adam as upcoming fighters. That being said, other characters such as Rick and Morty from… Rick & Morty have stepped in ahead of the teased pair.
As for how Stripe is going to play, we frankly have absolutely no clue whatsoever. However, if Gizmo is this madcap, popcorn throwing and car driving maniac, you can only imagine how aggressive and ruthless his evil counterpart will be. For those of you out there who don’t know what Gremlins is, it’s a 1984 movie that was apparently a big hit back in the day. I wouldn’t know because I’m not ancient, and haven’t seen a video player anyway outside an Oxfam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, we finally got an insight into just how much Microsoft earns from its Xbox Game Pass service thanks to some data coming out of Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (or CADE, if you're fancy). Per figures gleaned from the data, it was revealed that Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021 (not including Xbox Game Pass for PC).
But that may have raised the question about how much Microsoft spends on games as it adds them to the service. We know Microsoft's Chris Charla has admitted to paying developers and publishers "hundreds of millions of dollars" in Game Pass license fees since the subscription service first came to our consoles, back in 2017. But we've never really had a specific figure to attach to Xbox Game Pass – or even Microsoft's subscription service rival, PS Plus.
That's changed now, though. Over on Twitter, Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach posted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by Snail Games USA  – who you may recognise as the parent company of Studio Wildcard, the developer behind Ark: Survival Evolved. And it shows a fascinating insight into how much platform holders are paying to feature titles in their monthly line-ups and services.

It's getting close to five years already, and though we were hoping to finally get our hands on it this year, this sadly won't be happening.
Developer The Astronauts announced today that it has pushed back the early access release of the game to sometime in early 2023.
In a blog post, the developer revealed that it's changing the game's combat flow from arena-style encounters to the more organic open-world combat. This is significant enough to warrant that delay, but the good news is that the feature is "95% implemented."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Capcom revealed that Street Fighter 6 was going to be split into three distinct menu options that each lead to relatively separate experiences, I was curious – but I thought it was just a gimmick. Experiencing the Battle Hub in the beta has shown me that it's more than that; it's a way to honor the past.

In real terms, the Battle Hub is simply a lobby system. Whereas in Street Fighter 4 or Street Fighter 5 matches were found through matchmaking systems that ran through regular menus, SF6 recontextualizes the wrapper around finding matches into a bizarre sort of Second Life-style, semi-MMO experience where you join a server and literally noodle around a 3D space.

There's a bit of cross-over with other modes, too. The character you run around with is created for the single-player World Tour mode, which we're yet to see much of – though now we at least know that you can create some wonderfully frightening-looking protagonists for it with a surprisingly open-ended character. The Street Fighter battles you'll participate in, meanwhile, are straight out of the versus 'Fighting Ground' mode I've previewed before – just online, instead of off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I think of Lego today - the toy itself, as well as its many video game versions - it’s easy to get distracted by the decades of licensed properties now immortalised in plastic bricks. I think of building my Lego NES console, or the looming Lord of the Rings Tower of Orthanc which sits next to my telly. In Lego video games, I think of the time I spent roaming round Hogwarts or the Batcave, or the enormous Star Wars galaxy in the recent Skywalker Saga. It’s only after more thought I remember the older models I began with, as a child in the rather distant past. 


That’s not to say those early sets were forgettable! I still have the bricks from those castles I cobbled together, or from the rockets I launched from secret bases built under the coffee table. But when I think of those time…]]></summary>

The series was set to be directed and developed by Seth Kearsley, whose other credits include Eight Crazy Nights and The Looney Tunes Show.

In 2002, the same year as the release of the original Kingdom Hearts game, Kearsley was hired by Disney TV for the series. Although the pilot tested "exceptionally well", it was canned due to Square Enix's future plans for "many more games" in the series.

In response to continued questions over whether Microsoft owning Call of Duty would unfairly hobble PlayStation, Microsoft claimed that every COD player on PlayStation could move over to Xbox, and Sony's playerbase would still remain "significantly larger" than its own. 


Microsoft does not go into detail on its mental arithmetic here, but does note elswhere in its comments that PlayStation currently has a console install base of 150 million, compared to Xbox's install base of 63.7 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[John Carpenter never gives a dull interview, and his latest with AV Club is no exception. As a highly esteemed horror filmmaker and composer, and an avid gamer, he also has a lot to say about video games. 
AV Club’s William Hughes asked Carpenter all about the games he’d played, what he likes about them, and even his gaming routine. What quickly emerged was Carpenter’s addiction to Fallout 76, “I got hooked on this Fallout 76 game. Been hooked for a good long time on it. You know, I know it had bugs coming out, and a lot of it was put down, but I thought it was great. It’s really fun to play.” He’d also mentioned he’d been keeping up with Borderlands and Horizon Forbidden West.
It was noted that Carpenter seems to enjoy open-world titles with more exploration, to which he said, “It’s fun. Your freedom to roam around and do it your way. And that’s what I love about Fallout.” There is a template to follow, there are missions, but you can do it differently. And they keep coming up with new missions every once in a while, and new ideas,” Carpenter says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 14 has passed 27 million registered players, according to director Naoki Yoshida on a special celebration livestream. The figure was unveiled from a large golden disco ball alongside Square Enix CEO Yosuke Matsuda, which I can now only assume is the way they reveal any big news within the company.
This is an astounding milestone for the game of course, which quickly rose in popularity in the west during both the COVID lockdowns and Activision Blizzard’s epic fumbling of the once lustrous World of Warcraft ball. It became so popular in fact that they had to stop new players from creating accounts!
That’s not all from the livestream either. Alongside the chunky 27 million flex, the team also seemed confident that they could reach 30 million by next year, coincidentally the 10-year anniversary of the MMORPG’s release. With the ever-growing popularity of the title, it’s hard to imagine it not making it to be honest, even with World of Warcraft: Dragonflight launching in late November and tempting back Blizzard refugees who may have jumped ship recently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next update for Warner Bros.' brawler MultiVersus is here, and with it has brought the, quite frankly terrifying, gremlin Stripe along with a host of Halloween themed cosmetics. 


Stripe's arrival follows that of fellow Gremlins alum Gizmo. Unlike Gizmo, however, Stripe will wield a chainsaw - you know, for those times when you want to go full Ash Williams. 


Stripe's standard look is unlockable with either 2000 Gold, one Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium. If you fancy something a little bit more Rambo-like, you can unlock his Combat Stripe variant with 800 Gleamium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix's Final Fantasy 7 battle royale The First Soldier will shut down in January next year.


The game was first released in November 2021, meaning its shelf life was a little over 12 months.


News of its end was announced on Twitter: "Despite all our efforts to bring you regular updates with fresh and exciting content, we haven't been able to deliver the experience that we were hoping to, and that you all deserve, so we have made the extremely tough decision to end service for Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook parent company Meta has snaffled up several developers, including ReCore maker Armature Studio, to fold into its own Oculus Studios brand. 


Armature will be joined as part of Meta by LocoCycle and 'Splosion Man developer Twisted Pixel Games, as well as Marvel's Iron Man VR company Camouflaj. 


Meta made the acquisition announcements last night as part of its Meta Connect event, where it also confirmed a partnership with Xbox Cloud Gaming to see Microsoft's game streaming tech arrive on Quest VR headsets. The new £1500 Quest Pro headset was also given an official unveiling - after an early unit recently turned up in a hotel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know you’ve got a good game on your hands when its Steam Next Fest demo manages to infiltrate – and climb! – the Top 50 Most Played games list in just one week. You know it’s a game worth looking at when critics and consumers alike flock to a demo, eager to see what all the buzz is about. UNDECEMBER has managed to whip up something of a cult following already – and it’s not even out yet. 

It’s probably because the cross-platform hack ‘n’ slash RPG is doing something different. In UNDECEMBER, you take on the role of a Rune Hunter: a hero destined to stop the 13th god of this world – one pre-determined to be evil and unholy – from being born. The other 12 gods shared out their powers and gifts to Rune Hunters, giving humans the ability to prevent the birth of their awful sibling. It’s up to you to hunt down those powers and use them for yourself. 

To that end, in UNDECEMBER, there is no set class. When you boot up the game, you select either a male or female character, adjust your appearance, and then that’s it – you’re in the world. There’s no shaman, demon hunter, warrior, paladin; instead, you build your character with gears and skills of your choice as you move on.

Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues. While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

After a rocky launch consisting of congested servers, a controversial SMS Protect system, multiple DDoS attacks, and plenty of other bugs, Blizzard are attempting to make good by offering a digital goodybag to players.
Even then, this digital goodybag certainly falls under the mark when it comes to making reparations with players. In a recent tweet on the Overwatch account, Blizzard said that, “When #Overwatch2 launch is bumpy, you make it up to players. Besides making progress on bug fixes & stabilization, we've got goodies to share with all players.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Volition has detailed its Saints Row reboot's first major update, saying that while it would have "preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions" at this juncture, it will initially be prioritising "improvements over new features".


Saints Row released to a middling reception in August, with its enjoyable open-world zaniness rather dampened by its considerable number of bugs. It's these that Volition hopes to address in its first major post-launch update in November, explaining in a new blog post, "We know there is still work to do to improve your experience in the game."


"We are supporting Saints Row for the long-term," it insisted, "and while we'd have preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions, right now we feel the focus must be on telling you how we're going to improve the... experience for all players in 2022 and beyond."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than launching a new Call of Duty title in 2023, Activision is reportedly planning to instead release a premium expansion including new "campaign content" for Modern Warfare 2.


Word of new paid campaign DLC for Modern Warfare 2 was initially shared by Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who claimed it would arrive in the game's second year (ie. 2023) and would be bundled with a 20th anniversary "greatest hits map pack" containing classic maps from the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2, as well as maps from across the series.


Following TheGhostofHope's campaign DLC claims, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier stepped in to corroborate the news. "Next year [Activision Blizzard will] be selling new stuff for MW2", he wrote in a tweet, "an expansion or something like that". Although Schreier admitted he wasn't "sure exactly what it'll look like", he claimed it would have "campaign stuff too".

It promises a swankier virtual reality experience over the Meta Quest 2, with higher resolution displays, a lighter headset, and new Quest Touch Pro controllers included.

The downside: it'll cost you £1500/$1500 versus the Quest 2's £400, with Meta saying the headset is designed for business and not gaming.

EA Sports PGA Tour - the publisher's first foray into golfing sims since 2015's Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March last year, promising to deliver world famous golf courses and professional golfers as part of a long-term deal with the PGA Tour.


One year-long delay later, EA Sports PGA Tour is shuffling ever-closer to release, and EA's first major reveal for the game comes in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer.

According to the official Need for Speed Unbound Twitter account, while you can choose your driving effects, you can also choose never to turn them on in the first place.
While with Unbound you can still race around in hyper-realistic cars, you can also turn your experience into an art form with self-expression. This comes in the form of being able to "tag the world" when deploying your boosting powers. Tags are earned through actions such as drifting, jumps, and near misses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee's recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as "extremely relevant to [my] interests". So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

Along with this announcement, we also have a nice shiny new trailer from Devolver Digital to mark the occasion. This trailer, which you can see below, shows off some of the extreme temple runs that you as the player will have to navigate.  


This "massive asynchronous multiplayer" will throw players into those temples seen above and task them with retrieving ancient relics from within. There will be hidden traps to account for, and, as with all good temple exploration, there will of course be guardians that will do everything in their power to stop players from reaching their goal.

While looking over a tweet from the executive showing off shelves of items, on the very top shelf there's a small white box that looks similar to a mini-Xbox. Even the power button looks similar.
This has led many to believe the small box is the streaming device Microsoft has in the works under the codename "Keystone".

In what way, you might reasonably be wondering,  is the Lunar Shift Special Edition Wireless Controller "surreal"? Is it perhaps formed from the whisper of a backward-speaking entity in a red-curtain-clad room? Does it droop provocatively across surfaces like a slowly melting pocket watch? Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?


Alas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift's big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year's Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light. This, says, Microsoft, gives it a "stylised, smokey atmosphere".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh my word, I'd forgotten about Sharkey's 3D Pool. What a grand old game. Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn't have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent's ball: that was just extraneous detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, we learned that Overwatch 2 would be ditching its controversial loot boxes. The industry celebrated, and why not? Various countries around the world have decreed that loot boxes equate to gambling, with the UK government demanding publishers put measures in place that safeguard children from the adverse effects of them. 18 European countries have also backed measures calling for loot box regulation.

For Overwatch – one of the biggest games that popularised the use of loot boxes in the first place – to renege and opt for the battle pass (as seen in Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Fortnite, and many others besides)... that’s a big move. Seismic. It had the potential to rewrite the rule book, set a precedent for responsible and engaging progression whilst still monetizing the game. Because that, essentially, is what this is all about. Instead, though, the battle pass implementation has been one of the worst I’ve seen in a game for a long time – possibly ever. 

Let’s set the scene. Overwatch is dead. There’s no going back to the original game, now; it is offline, supplanted and replaced wholly by Overwatch 2. The way you used to earn cosmetics and goods for your various heroes – by opening loot boxes and getting randomised rewards – has been replaced with two tracks of a battle pass (one paid, one free).

I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

David Gibson, senior analyst at MST Financial, shared a graph on Twitter showing the imports to the US per month from June 2021 onwards, with a huge spike during last month.

Gibson added he believes some of the stock will go towards the launch of God of War Ragnarök, which makes a lot of sense. Ragnarök is the next first-party title for PlayStation, and Sony will be undoubtedly eager to capitalise on its release to bolster sales of the PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coral Island  self-describes as a "reimagining of farming games", but if we're being real it doesn't reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).
That's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

However, PlayStation head Hermen Hulst has made it known that this is not the case. Well, at least, it is not entirely the case.
Chatting to Axios, Hulst stated that the initial 2013 release of The Last of Us was "a little ahead of its time in terms of its creative vision". Hulst claimed that the limitations of technology at this time meant that Naughty Dog's ideas ultimately had to be dialled back a notch or two.

Game director Kento Kinoshita told Polygon that although playable Lady D is still taller than any other character in Mercenaries, she’s been shortened to “a little under nine feet tall” from her canon height of around nine feet six inches. Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you tired of fighting tooth and nail for a PS5? Wouldn’t you like to leave the fist fights and public brawls behind in favour of a more adult, more refined gaming experience? Well BMW, of all companies, may be your answer brave wanderer. Starting next year, owners of these fancy, expensive cars will be able to play a variety of games from inside their shiny rides. Hopefully not while driving… Unless you wanna take your gamer credentials to a whole other, almost certainly illegal, level.
This doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to plug a Dualsense or Xbox pad into your car. No, instead the new gaming collection will be played via a connected Smartphone and the in-built Curved Display. The official press release states that the partnership between the BMW Group and Airconsole (who is responsible for the phones-as-gamepads tech used) will “bring casual gaming into new BMW vehicles”. So Mythic WoW Raiders, Warzone demons, and Rocket League zoomers may not be the target audience here. 
Looking at the AirConsole website, it’s clear this is the responsible family’s gaming option. Titles like Brawlanders, Golfriends, Monkey Business and almost 180 more titles clearly appeal to a younger crowd who’d otherwise be causing havoc in the back seats. However, Drunk Casino is the clear winner for me, and sounds like the perfect title for me while I’m headed to work. If I owned a BMW, or a car, or could drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered that I am towards the micromanagement end of the scale when it comes to Football Manager. Or maybe more accurately, off the end of that scale, a spec in the distance visible only with the kind of magnifying glass I use to inspect my player's daily training habits. I'm the one you hear about with the spreadsheets and the 100 percent press conference attendance record, and while I have no shame at all, it has always made me a bit sceptical of FM's portable modes, the recent Xbox versions included.


Having played it for a good few hours of it up at developer Sports Interactive's studios, however, the new PS5 version of FM23 goes a good way towards putting me at ease. There are a few versions here, so for clarity a quick whip-round: Football Manager is the fullest version, which you can only play on PC; FM Mobile is the lightest version designed for playing on commutes and sun loungers, with a heavily trimmed-back set of features and systems; FM Touch is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Mobile, designed for the Switch; FM Xbox was brought in more recently and is a slightly more in-depth version of FM Touch, but still a long way off from full-fat Football Manager. 


This year, with the arrival of the PS5 version, things have been rejigged a little. The Xbox version is gone, and there's now FM Console, which is the same across PS5 and Xbox (but Switch is still Touch). FM Console is definitely lighter than the full version, but also far, far closer to it than ever before. In brief, it feels like the main, PC Football Manager game was the starting point here, with things tweaked to fit into a console-style user experience, as opposed to being built from the Mobile version outwards.

When having a closer look at those files for Demon's Souls, McDonald came across a rather endearing and fun inclusion by developer BluePoint Games. It turns out that there are 3D model files for the one and only 'Ring of the Chieftain' tucked away in the PS5 remake.

        <updated>2022-10-11T13:19:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s felt like DLSS has been in the process of becoming an irreplaceable tentpole feature of graphical video game presentation for a while now. As more games adopt the feature and its similar equivalents from other companies, it becomes ever harder to justify turning it off – and with some tasty demos for its latest iteration, Nvidia appears to be truly upping the ante. 
DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, and it’s a clever AI-assisted feature that essentially allows you to get higher frame rates in games without having to sacrifice their visual fidelity. A game that might only run at 30 frames per second in regular settings could previously often be cranked up to over 60fps with DLSS enabled – and with DLSS 3.0, Nvidia aims to crank the gains up even further.
The way DLSS works is pretty simple. AI models are trained on the visuals of games, meaning that the AI can effectively upscale a game with such accuracy in its fidelity that it’s near-enough indistinguishable from the game natively running at a much higher resolution. Running at a lower initial resolution is helpful for settings, however, allowing you to crank up all those delicious PC gaming graphics toggles to max – including ray tracing, the transformative lighting feature that also has a habit of tanking frame rates.

        <updated>2022-10-11T13:15:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The embargo lifts today on Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 and it's a phenomenal achievement in graphics performance - as you might hope and expect from a $1600/£1650 GPU. The full Eurogamer review will follow as soon as possible but so much work in Digital Foundry has been poured into this project that we've only just managed to finish the video review in time. With minutes left until the embargo lifts, I wanted to share the review with the Eurogamer audience - and to offer up some personal thoughts on the product.
First of all, I think it is important to stress that the power level of this product shows a leap in performance that surrounding components within a gaming PC may struggle to fully access. 1080p and 1440p metrics with this product are essentially meaningless - even with my Core i9 12900K overclocked to 5.2GHz on all performance cores, I'm finding frame-rates hitting the CPU limit. This happens even on some 4K benchmarks without ray tracing in the equation. And even if you are using RT, opting for DLSS performance mode (with an internal 1080p base image) can again see you hitting the limits of your processor.
Over the last few weeks, it's been really interesting just to 'live' with the card for PC gaming - I use a 4K 120Hz LG OLED CX display, and it's a good fit for the RTX 4090. I don't need to worry about settings, I don't need to worry about performance. I'd venture to suggest that for non-RT gaming, the graphics problem is 'solved'. Ray tracing? No worries there either, thanks to DLSS. However, if I did not have a 4K 120Hz display, I do wonder whether I'd need the 4090. That's my subjective opinion on gaming with the card, but here's the full video review where you get all the numbers you need.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evercore Heroes — a new game coming from Vela Games with former EA and Riot Veterans behind the wheel — has just been announced! The Dublin-based studio’s premier title, the game combines real-time skill focused gameplay found in MOBAs, with the cooperative teamplay required in MMO dungeon runs in what could be a unique twist on a popular genre.
The game is set in a science x fantasy world called Lumerea, where a range of diverse and unique heroes can be found and of course played around with. This includes characters like the shadowy assassin Shade, the steadfast tanky defender Fyn, and Shining archer Zari among others. As you may expect, each hero has their own skills, abilities and strengths.
“Our goal has always been to make the game players really want, even if it means breaking the mould,” said Vela Games CEO and Co-Founder, Travis George. “With EVERCORE Heroes, we are building a unique multiplayer experience that brings together skill-based co-op and competitive play in a fresh new way. And after over two years of great feedback from early testing, we’re ecstatic to finally share the game with the world."

The team, which contains a number of people who worked on League of Legends, describes it as "competitive PvE". My own notes from a recent online presentation suggest it's a WoW raid mixed with a bit of Puyo Tetris. Having had the time to think about it, though, I suspect the whole thing is like one of those fancy cocktails where the different elements separate and form a rainbow strata: Evercore Heroes is simple at first, then complicated, and then ultimately pretty simple again. And hopefully delicious.


Here's where I'd start. You jump into a team of four heroes, all working through a sort of raid area. You're fighting mobs in order to get more powerful, because at the end of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 has been out for a decent amount of time now, enough of a stretch for the vast number of players to hopefully get through the login queues and try the hero shooter out for themselves. While the gameplay changes (or lack thereof) remain a hot button topic right now among the community, it’s the new battle pass system that really has people riled up, with some even looking back at the loot boxes of Overwatch 1 with newfound fondness.
But what exactly is this new system and why has it got people mad. Well, Overwatch 2 has replaced the old method of unlocking new content — a combination of free and premium loot boxes that contained skins — with a traditional battle pass that has become all the rage over the past few years. This pass contains skins, sprays, voice lines and yes, even new heroes…
Let’s start with that final point, a real rough spot for some among the Overwatch 2 player base. If you buy the premium pass right now, you get the newest character (Kiriko) right away. Bam! However, if you stick to the free pass, you’ll need to progress through 55 levels of the system before you can play the featured hero. Considering Overwatch is an FPS focused around counterpicks and team composition, this isn’t too great for those who want to dive straight into competitive matches. Not to mention, new characters previously were given out for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Bricktales is the sort of game that would’ve been seismic to me as a child. Lego obsessed from the moment I held my first set, I’ve nevertheless felt that Lego video games have more often than not deliberately dodged or accidentally avoided the freedom of expression and creativity that these magical little bricks allow in the real world. When a game embraces that angle, it’s often gold, as was the case for many of the classic Lego games of the nineties. In Lego Bricktales, we finally have another such game – and it’s brilliant.

Bricktales is a clever, casual, and devilishly challenging experience. It’s a low-key genre mash-up bringing together puzzle-solving curios with light adventure and exploration elements. Rather than a franchise tie-in action game where the Lego aesthetic is… well, an aesthetic, here it’s at the heart of the experience: this is a game about building.

Bricktales essentially takes place inside small dioramas, many of which are based on classic Lego themes like Pirates, Castles, and Theme Parks. Your protagonist travels through this world with a superpower: the ability to build. Your job is to travel through each of the game’s stages by building items and structures that’ll help solve puzzles and open up new areas. Along the way, you’ll also acquire a few non-building abilities and tackle some light traversal puzzles.

In addition, Overwatch 2's character roster has had to be downsized a tad to allow Blizzard to "iron out a few bugs". Unfortunately for the developer, however, this has created a new bug of its own, resulting in even more characters becoming inaccessible for some Overwatch 2 players.


On the official customer support Twitter account, Blizzard addressed the DDoS attack faced by Battle.net yesterday. This has reportedly now all been dealt with, however it managed to cause widespread issues for players of both Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

With their release, many of us will be headed back to Village once more to see what Rose Winters is capable of in the Shadows of Rose DLC, or to go and fight hordes in Mercenaries.
In an interview with Polygon, game director Kento Kinoshita had plenty to say about Mercenaries, including exactly what it might feel like finally playing as every Resident Evil fan's favourite vampire, Lady Dimitrescu.
Mercenaries will feature the playable debut of both Lady D and Karl Heisenberg, and when asked about adapting new characters for the game mode, Kinoshita shared, “When adapting them for The Mercenaries, we made a conscious effort to give each one their own distinct feel. Chris is a hybrid character that combines long-range attacks (firearms) with close-combat (fists). Meanwhile, Heisenberg wields magnetic force to unleash close-range assaults.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alice Ruppert has been speaking out about how horses are represented in games ever since Assassin's Creed 3. She'd had such high hopes for it after Red Dead Redemption 1, a game and series she really rates. But when AC3 came along and horses were nothing more than disposable taxis you could pick up at every outpost, she was sorely disappointed. The game didn't even save your horse choice through loading screens. She's been speaking out about horses in games ever since.
She does it on the wonderfully named website The Mane Quest, where her in-depth reviews - she records horse movement and analyses it frame by frame - have earnt her a loyal following. Her work, and her background in game design, eventually even got her a job making a horse game called  Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is out really soon on PC and Switch.
So how bad are horses in games today? Read on, dear reader. I'll deal with a few famous games before broadening into more general mistakes, and what they can do about them. All of this is taken from my podcast interview with Alice Ruppert, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts (look for "Eurogamer Podcasts").

On launch, servers were at full capacity while simultaneously being hit with DDoS attacks, meaning it was a long wait to get into a game you might be disconnected from. 
Then, Blizzard removed its controversial SMS Protect system (for Overwatch 1 players) that was also locking out some players from jumping into all the action. There was a chat bug that saw players accidentally making purchases, and Bastion’s ultimate is completely broken.
Ultimately, Overwatch 2 is the latest in a long line of terrible game launches, beyond the initial grudges we had against the queues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phil Spencer's shelf is at it again. Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft's long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.


Spencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, "Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary." Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that's supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.


As described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was 'pivoting away' from the then-current iteration to refocus on "a new approach".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news everyone! You can now link together your Steam and PSN accounts. In case you’re not shaking in your boots, screaming and soiling yourself in hype, this means you can claim some super rad free stuff on PC versions of certain PlayStation titles. Snark and sarcasm aside, this marks the latest step in Sony’s invasion of the PC platform.
You want an example of some of the perks? How about Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles Morales buddy? If you link together your Steam and PSN accounts, you can claim some cosmetics and in-game bonuses including the Resilient Suit, and early unlock of the Concussive Blast, and two skills points. 
But what else does this mean, aside from Miles Morales players getting a nice little boost if they decide to pick up the game on the PC right now. Well, as briefly mentioned earlier, it’s a rather major milestone in Sony’s slow but steady trudge onto the platform. We’ve seen it make pushes here and there with services like PlayStation Now allowing you to play games like Bloodborne on PC for a while now, but this newfound connectivity adds some extra justification for porting over Sony’s biggest titles to the platform.

However, skipping intervening releases does, in fact, often work quite well. Apparently, this is surprising to many people, even Debian insiders. I was encouraged to write about it some more.
My personal experience
I have three conventionally-managed personal server systems (by which I mean systems which aren’t reprovisioned by some kind of automation). Of these at least two have been skip upgraded at least once:

It's the perfect time, then, to stay indoors; watch the long autumn evenings drip into night from the safety of your sofa, where you're all wrapped up with a mug of tea and your favourite spooky game. Maybe you'll turn to an old classic – Resident Evil or Dead Space – and by the time you look outside again, there's only the pale light of a harvest moon, illuminating the dead streets and frigid pavements of your road.
Perhaps you don't want to get back into a classic, though – you've played through SOMA one too many times, maybe, and Alien: Isolation just isn't cutting it for you anymore. So we're here to help.

Then, at TwitchCon San Diego during the Patch Notes livestream, Twitch addressed the issue once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 had its closed beta test over the weekend, giving lucky fans a taster of what the game will have to offer when it releases.

Players were also able to use the in-game character creation to make a custom fighter for the closed beta and so, unsurprisingly, people decided to experiment and see how far they could push those polygons.

And boy, did you all push them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do we really need a Horizon Zero Dawn remake? That was the first topic on this week's Digital Foundry Direct, as John, Rich and Alex grapple with the prospect of a PS5 remaster of a recently-released PlayStation 4 title. 
It's a hard question to answer, as undoubtedly the team at Guerrilla Games wants their work to be playable at the best possible quality, but the 2017 PS4 release already runs well on PS5 thanks to a patch - and the PC edition from 2020 remains one of the best-looking games on the platform two years later. Creating a remake could be a good way for the developers to work on a PS5-only engine for future titles but that same development time could also be devoted to an entirely new Horizon game, albeit one that won't result in an influx of cash for the company quite as soon. 
It's an interesting point of discussion, and the rest of the spreadsheet that spawned the Horizon Zero Dawn remake rumour also makes for entertaining reading. There's mention of a Horizon multiplayer 'live service' game for PS5 and PC and a new Death Stranding, for example.

Many fans are outraged by the fact that the original voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, will not be bringing his classic take on the character to the silver screen. Instead, he's been replaced by Hollywood superstar Chris Pratt, a move which many have dismissed as stunt casting, on the grounds that Chris Pratt isn't Italian and famously doesn't even like cured meats.

While Charles Martinet isn't a Hollywood name (ask one of your normal mates about him and expect blank stares before a suggestion that he's a footballer or something), he's far from just the "voice of Mario." He's got quite a few voices, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent interview with PCGamer, Nate Purkeypile gave many of us an insight into Bethesda’s upcoming RPG, Starfield. Nate has been a developer for 17 years, with 14 of those years being spent at Bethesda working on the likes of Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. 
Now, Nate is the founder of Just Purkey Games, spending time on smaller projects. While he, for rather obvious reasons, couldn’t share too much about Starfield, Nate did have some interesting things to say when it comes to working with Bethesda on Starfield.
When asked about just how big Starfield really is, it became clear that Starfield isn’t just a huge game, it has an even larger team behind it, too. “Starfield is a much bigger project, it’s like 500 people or something on the team, whereas I think [Fallout] 76 was maybe 200, tops,” said Nate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 players are coming under fire a tad more than usual right now, thanks to a bug that allows Bastion to infinitely shoot their ultimate until their ultimate timer runs out. While you’re usually only able to use it three times before you’re kicked out, this glitch allows Bastion mains in the know to unload shot after shot for up to eight seconds — more than enough time to clear out an objective or kill most of a team.
What’s worse is that it’s easily reproducible. To fire off a shot, you can use one of two inputs. The trick is to use your left click / right trigger for the first two shots, before pressing both inputs at the same time for each consecutive shot afterwards. On PC this means using left click and Q at the same time, although some have been rebinding their left click input to other keys to make the bug that much easier to reproduce.
The result? An otherwise underwhelming ultimate for a typical subpar Overwatch hero is currently causing havoc online. Regardless of your hero or what role you’re filling, an endless stream of high-damage shells is enough to wipe out anyone, and while eight seconds might not sound like a lot, it’s more than enough time to blow through the vast majority of the enemy team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might sound like an unlikely crossover, but based on a recent leak, real life footballers might make an appearance in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.


As spotted by Insider Gaming, notable Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope recently shared a list of unreleased operators for Modern Warfare 2. Call of Duty leaks are a dime a dozen, but this one lists big name footballers like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and more as potential operators. TheGhostOfHope wasn't able to elaborate on the leak, noting that they don't have "a clue why" it's a list of football player names.


The names could just be temporary placeholders, so there's no guarantee that these footballers will be seen running and gunning around the place, though it would be an odd choice for some file names. Call of Duty isn't exactly a stranger to odd collaborations, like when the series featured Godzilla and King Kong, or the Attack on Titan cosmetic pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no specific date just yet, and it doesn't seem to be coming out this year any more, but the System Shock remake might finally be out next year.


This spot comes courtesy of deals wizard and news poster Wario64, who noticed that the Steam page for the System Shock remake appears to have been updated to say March 2023 (thanks, Eurogamer). An official announcement regarding a release date hasn't been confirmed as of yet, but up until this point the game was expected to release sometime this year. Though considering how much of the year is left, a push to next year isn't all that surprising.


Being developed by Nightdive Studios, the System Shock remake was born as a Kickstarter project way back in 2016, with an initial expected release date of 2017. That obviously never happened, with the game receiving numerous delays over the years, bringing us to now where it's more of a 'it'll come out when it comes out' situation.

The page continues: "Adding a phone number will allow Blizzard Entertainment to send you notifications when important changes are made to your account. Any mobile phone in a supported country with a data plan, and that is not prepaid or a VOIP number, can be used with this service" (thanks, PCGamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MutliVersus game director, Tony Huynh, has made a habit of teasing or outright announcing future changes to the game via social media, a practice that has frankly established a strong link between the development team and the community over the past few months since launch. However, a recent Tweet has sent the community spiralling. Some, seemingly overjoyed! Others, very worried.
This change is a hard limit to the number of times you can use the same move in a combo, an effort to clamp down on “infinites”. These refer to combos that can — in theory — go on forever, unless the opposing player falls away from the blows or the attacking player suffers from a moment of input error. While current anti-infinite systems are in place, which drastically lowers the damage of repeated moves in the same combo, a hard combo breaker would drastically affect the ability to perform extended attack strings.
So, first things first, who does this affect the most? Well, certain characters have had long winded combos that use repeated moves  — and yes, even infinites — for some time now. Harley Quinn and Superman are the most prevalent, able to combo players from spawn to ludicrously high percentages and even straight up kills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, did I ever mention that I got to play on the PSVR 2 recently? Because I did and I actually had a wonderful time playing demos of four upcoming PSVR2 games on Sony's new  VR headset. Inspired by that preview session, on this week's episode of VR Corner (above), I decided to dig into the ever-growing list of confirmed PSVR 2 titles and whittle it down to the 13 games I'm most excited to play. Fair warning, as this is my opinion only and it's my favourite VR genre, there are a lot of shooters in there so shout outs to the runners up, Demeo and Ultrawings 2 that just missed out on making the cut for this list.
Firewall Ultra
So far details are light on what Firewall Ultra, the PSVR 2 exclusive follow up to Firewall Zero Hour has to offer in terms of new gameplay. However, the original was one of my all-time favourite PSVR titles and this tactical shooter delivered some superb Rainbow Six Siege style gameplay that just felt phenomenal to experience in VR. The sneak peeks of gampelay we’ve been shown in recent trailers have sent my anticipation levels into overdrive though. Not only are we bound to see much better visuals this time around, thanks to the PSVR2’s 4K HDR but (according to a splash screen at the end of the Firewall Ultra reveal trailer) the game will also take advantage of all the PSVR2’s new hardware features such as finger touch detection, foveated rendering, adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. Which means you’re actually going to feel it the next time you get shot in the head by the opposition!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The director of an upcoming movie based on Konami’s survival horror Silent Hill series has seemingly confirmed that more than one new game is being worked on. Christophe Gans, who directed the iffy 2006 adaptation of Silent Hill and is working on a second film, spoke about his involvement with Konami on the series in a French language interview. The interview was picked up by fans on ResetEra, who translated Gans’ comments.

If I had a nickel for every weird place you're able to play Doom, I'd probably have quite a few nickels, because people just seem incredibly determined to get it to run on anything they can get their hands on. Today, this particular nickel of mine comes from developer Samperson, who got Doom running on the note taking software Notepad (slight flashing warning in the example video seen below).


While it's definitely one of the more unreadable versions of Doom, you have to admit when watching the video, this is in fact Doom. The game itself is obviously made up of a bunch of various characters lined up to resemble the visuals of Doom. It even sounds like Samperson got the audio and soundtrack working and synced up, which could not be anything but witchcraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[International regulators around the world are pouring over the finer details of the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger, and some of the information coming out of the enquries are fascinating. The most recent – and revealing – byte of data comes via TweakTown, and from Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), which has managed to finally shed some light on how much money Xbox Game Pass actually makes for Microsoft.
Per data shared with CADE, Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021 (not including Xbox Game Pass for PC). This is the first time we've seen data like this, and it sheds a light on how important the service is for Microsoft. 
Elsewhere, there's more interesting data coming out of CADE – like the revelation that Xbox gaming generated an eye-watering total revenue of $16.28 billion for Microsoft in the 2021 calendar year.

I've wondered about it ever since I started healing in Dark Age of Camelot 20 years ago. I don't know why I did it or stuck with it, but in every game I play now, I gravitate towards that role. 


And having played healers for so long, I've seen the good and the bad of it. I've been moaned at, and I've been killed as a matter of priority by enemy teams more times than I can count. And let's face it, it's not always fun - not just for those reasons, but because healing isn't the flashy stuff games are sold on.

After the talk, Franz Thoma approached me and told me a story of how we was once implementing the game Minesweeper in Haskell, and in particular the part of the logic where, after the user has uncovered a field, the game would automatically uncover all fields that are next to a “neutral” field, i.e. one with zero adjacent bombs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the first trailer for the Super Mario Bros Movie, prolific voice actress Tara Strong has criticised the casting of the titular plumber.


To pretty much everyone's horror, last year it was revealed that Chris Pratt would play Mario in Illumination's adaptation of the beloved series. In one part, fans were unhappy that an actor that has been associated with a controversial church (which he later noted was not a church he attends, but in fact a different one that also isn't great). But fans were also unhappy that Mario himself, Charles Martinet, would not be reprising his role. Like fans of the actor, fellow voice actress Tara Strong also doesn't seem to be happy.


Strong, known for a huge number of roles, notably including multiple stints as Harley Quinn, and Fairly Odd Parent's Timmy Turner, shared a photo of herself and Martinet with a caption that reads, "It should be Charles," obviously in references to the recent release of the first trailer of the film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it's not a new video game announcement, Atlus has announced that Persona 5 Royal is getting a card game adaptation. 


The new card game based on Persona 5 Royal very specifically is being designed by Emerson Matsuuchi, and is being published by Pandasauras Games, announced on the publisher's site. According to Matsuuchi, "Players will take on the roles of their favorite Phantom Thieves and fight to change the world in this cooperative card-based strategy game," though other than that no other details were provided on what the game will actually be like.


Nathan McNair, co-owner of Pandasaura Games, also said, As a diehard fan of Persona 5 Royal – I cannot wait to bring the Palaces, Velvet Room and world of Persona 5 Royal onto tabletops everywhere in 2023." The game is apparently targeting a Q4 2023 release, which is anywhere between October and December, though oddly an image on the site does specify an October 21 release date, so it could be then, it could be later.

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures' Illumination animation division. It sees Chris Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.

In a tweet, Strong - whose own prolific career includes voice performances as Harley Quinn, Batgirl, and Fairly Odd Parents' Timmy Turner - posted a photograph of herself and Martinet with the text: "it should be Charles".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some speculation from fans, Deathloop director Dinga Bakaba confirmed that the game is in fact set in the same world as Dishonored.

Arkane's games all tend to have some similarities here and there, being one of the few big developers to actually make immersive simulators, but Deathloop and Dishonored obviously shared some DNA in more obvious ways. But according to Deathloop's director himself, the games are both in fact in the same world, something likely to please fans that have theorised as such.


Bakaba confirmed the connection on the most recent episode of the Xbox Podcast (thanks PCGamer), where he said that Deathloop is "one of the futures of the Dishonored world." Asked directly about the connection, Bakaba noted how due to the nature of the game not everyone will see the same thing, "so it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after Death of the Outsider."

Nintendo obviously has a pretty family-friendly image for the most part, so you're unlikely to find scenes of a sexual nature in a Mario game. However, with the Nintendo Switch, some more risque games have made it onto the platform. According to one indie developer though, outright "uncensored nudes," won't be allowed on the eShop.


Publisher Gamuzumi recently confirmed that one of the games it's publishing, Hot Tentacles Shoot, would not be coming to Switch for the time being (thanks, Nintendo Everything). According to Gamuzumi, the reason for the game not being allowed on the eShop is that "obscene content could damage the brand and infringe its policies."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s difficult to believe, but today marks ten years since XCOM: Enemy Unknown was first released. A lot has changed in the world of gaming in the ensuing decade ⁠— but for my money, Firaxis’ vision of a modern XCOM game remains the best video game franchise reboot there’s ever been. 
Still the high bar for a video game remake, Enemy Unknown reimagines 1994’s X-COM: UFO Defense, dropping the dash in the name and dragging this unique strategy game, originally developed by MicroProse, into the modern age.
What makes XCOM brilliant is honestly a matter of sorcery ⁠— or, perhaps chemistry, if we’re being a little less romantic. The point is this: XCOM: Enemy Unknown is that rare pitch perfect game that threads the needle that any video game remake or reboot faces brilliantly. It kept that which made the original a beloved and fondly remembered cult classic, but took informative cues and ideas from games released in the interim. Many games have tried this, of course, but few have been so resoundingly successful at making it all work.

By default though, your options for connecting the controller are Bluetooth (on later models) or a wired USB connection - rather than the low-latency 2.4GHz wireless you get on Xbox consoles, which requires Microsoft's $25 Wireless Adapter for Windows. That adapter is down to $18 at Newegg today, and is well worth picking up while it's discounted.

As they'd been writing a message in chat at the time, they weren't able to cancel the purchase before it completed.

Be careful if you spot anything about Gotham Knights online, as there's a chance it could be a major plot spoiler. This has apparently come from an early release of the game's artbook (thanks, Eurogamer), which is obviously unfortunate for those who might have already seen spoilers.


This in turn has led to Gotham Knights' executive producer Fleur Marty to express frustration at sharing spoilers. "I can't begin to understand why would anyone spoil a story (whether it's a game, a movie, a book, whatever) for others," wrote Marty on her personal Twitter account.

Last month, PlatinumGames delivered the news that the servers for Babylon's Fall would be shutting down, and as it's an online-only game, that means it's going away forever. This wasn't particularly surprising news considering a few months ago the game literally only had one player online on Steam at one point. But in a new interview from VGC, the studio's CEO Atsushi Inaba hasn't changed its plans to progress with more live service titles (thanks, Eurogamer).


"Live service games are definitely something we do want to do and put our effort in moving forward," Inaba said. "There are two pillars, so to speak, that we can look at internally for our development teams, that being the people within the same company.

"I was actually encouraged not to," Ramsey told USA Today. "After my first audition, they asked me, 'Have you played it?' And I said 'nope', and they said, 'Keep it that way'.

As announced on the official Nintendo UK Twitter account, the second Splatfest coming to the threequel is Pokémon themed, where you'll either pick grass-, fire-, or water-type. This particular Splatfest is obviously coinciding with the release of Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, and kicks off at 1am UK time November 12, running until November 14, again at 1am, giving you a full 48 hours to splat your friends.


The announcement didn't note which types will be assigned to which Deep Cut member, so hopefully your favourite type doesn't get attached to your least favourite member (as if there it's possible to have a least favourite). Artwork paired with the announcement shows the three types with a little silhouette of the new three starters, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and best-duck Quaxly, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like a new Crash Bandicoot game is set to be revealed at The Game Awards, as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time gets a Steam release.


Earlier this week, a selection of press and influences received a Crash Bandicoot-themed pizza box that contained stuff like a t-shirt and charging cables, mostly innocuous merch for the most part, as detailed by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks GamesRadar). On the box the Crash 4 Steam release was teased with the text "Aku Aku's Steam-in Pizza Shack," before just outright saying it's coming to the store October 18. But a teaser on the side of the box is potentially hinting at the reveal of the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League.


If you haven't heard of Wumpa League before, there have been rumours surrounding the game for quite a while, with some concept art for the game having been shared earlier this year by DidYouKnowGaming's Liam Robertson. The reason some suspect that Wumpa League will be revealed at The Game Awards is a line of text on the side of the box that reads, "Hungry for more? Try our new wumpa pizza for $12.08!"

iptables to be able to run and communicate different virtualization systems
and containers on laptops running Debian GNU/Linux.
I’ve used different variations of this setup for a long time with
VirtualBox and KVM for
the Virtual Machines and Linux-VServer,
OpenVZ, LXC and lately
Docker or Podman for the
Containers.
Required packages
I’m running Debian Sid with systemd and network-manager to configure the
WiFi and Ethernet interfaces, but for the bridge I use bridge-utils with
ifupdown (as I said this setup is old, I guess ifupdow2 and ifupdown-ng
will work too).
To start and stop the DNS and DHCP services and add NAT rules when the
bridge is brought up or down I execute a script that uses:

But today is different, because back in 1982, not only did Kevin Toms create a smash hit game, he invented a whole new genre. 


"Conceptually, it was very different to most games," he explains to me via Skype. "At ZX shows, I had to constantly explain it was a football management game, and they'd go, 'oh, okay'." Often confused for some sort of weird text adventure, it was an abstruse concept for many - but not its author. "I already had the idea for the board game," explains Toms. "So I just thought a computer could do that, too."



From a young age, Toms harboured dreams of having a career in tabletop games. "When I was 15, my parents had to see the careers master at school," he says. "I asked them to ask him if it was possible to get a job as a board game designer." The inevitable reply came back. "He said it was a phase and that I'd grow out of it."

Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there's usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn't happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn't crash.

The company released the new Steam Deck trailer earlier this week to promote the fact you no longer needed a reservation to order one.
Spotted by eagle-eyed Nibellion (thanks, PC Gamer), you can clearly see the icon for the emulator on the Steam Deck screen in the video. Nibel's tweet was eventually seen by Valve, and the company quickly set the video to private and issued a new trailer.

Speaking in an interview with French outlet MaG - Movie & Game (thanks, ResetEra, via IGN) the Silent Hill movie director claimed that multiple games are in the works from several teams at Konami.
Gans said he is working with the same Silent Hill team he worked with on the first film in the franchise, which we assume is how he gained the information.

That's according to developer Krafton, which says update 20.1 – which goes live on 11th October for PC and 19th for consoles and introduces a new ranked season – includes "several improvements to weapon attachments, as well as updates to firing from vehicles, a new ranked season, world and map updates and quality-of-life updates". 

In response to the Vertical Foregrip "dominating the battlegrounds as the choice grip slot attachment", the team is changing the Thumbgrip, Angled Foregrip, Halfgrip, Lightweight Grip - and the Vertical Foregrip itself - in a bid to shake things up, promising to "monitor [our] plays after this balance update".

Yuzu is open-source and, crucially, legal, but as PC Gamer points out, emulation is a sticky topic for some, prompting Valve to upload an emulator-free version of the same video a short while later, which you can see below: 

"Valve's new official video for the Steam Deck has a very interesting game icon in it," industry insider Nibel tweeted yesterday, before following up with: "Update: Valve has removed the original video and reuploaded a new one with a small difference."

Christophe Gans, the director of the first Silent Hill movie - who we already knew was reportedly working on a third Silent Hill film - made the surprisingly candid revelations during a recent interview in which he seemingly confirmed the persistent whispers that there's more than one Silent Hill game in development, including one by a central internal Konami team.

His interview also definitively confirms that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake, several games are in development, he hasn't worked with Kojima, and he "knows a bit about" the next upcoming game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing a video game is a deeply personal experience. Unlike other mediums, you're in control of what happens. I'm not just talking about making choices in an RPG, but the way every single press of a button or tilt of a stick adds up to make your playthrough different from mine. While we always bring something of ourselves to books, movies or albums, the core text never changes. Unless you decide to cut up a novel and then stick the pages together in the wrong order or something.


You can watch someone else play a game, and there are now more ways to do so than ever, but it's not the same as poking around in someone else's game, something I'd never given any thought to. Not until I saw a message on Twitter asking for help with Elden Ring. This person, who I'm going to call Sellen, because they asked to be anonymous and it's the first Elden Ring NPC name that sprang to mind, had messed up their Elden Ring save game. They'd accidentally killed an NPC that they very much did not want to kill and were quite distraught. They shared that save with their partner and didn't want to potentially ruin the game for them.


Sellen was offering to pay someone to recreate their Elden Ring save, but without the unfortunate death of poor Jar Bairn. I can totally understand why, as young JB is an adorable little example of Elden Ring's fascinating pot people. Paying someone to play a game for you may seem strange, but after chatting with them privately, I discovered that they were both busy folks with little time to play games. While they'd only played the game for sixteen hours or so, that represented a couple of months of shared time that would be hard to get back. Intrigued by the challenge recreating their save presented, I accepted the oddest commission of my freelance career so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the release of Deathloop last year, fans have speculated that the acclaimed time loop shooter was, in fact, set in the same universe as Arkane Studios' much-loved Dishonored series - and now theorists can given finally themselves a pat on the back and pack away their cork boards: the developer has confirmed it is indeed so.


Creative director Dinga Bakaba broke the news during the latest episode of the Xbox podcast (thanks PC Gamer), confirming that Deathloop is "one of the futures of the Dishonored world."


When asked directly about the possible connection between the two games, Bakaba explained, "We have a number of systems [that mean] not everyone has seen the same thing [in Deathloop], not everyone has heard the same song hidden somewhere, not everyone has seen every room. So it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after [the third Dishonored game] Death of the Outsider."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like the end of 2022 is going to have more than a whiff of Crash Bandicoot about it. Not only has Activision confirmed an 18th October Steam release date for the well-recieved Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, it seems the publisher might just be gearing up to unveil the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League at this year's Game Awards.


All this news comes via a bit of promotional tat Activision has been sending out to influencers and press, taking the form of Crash-themed pizza box with goodies inside.


As detailed in a video by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks Games Radar), the promotional pizza box in question comes emblazoned with the words 'Aku Aku's Steam-in Pizza Shack', a not too subtle hint that the formerly Battle.net-exclusive PC version of Crash Bandicoot 4 will (as fans had already surmised) soon be making its way to Valve's storefront. And to clear up any doubt, that's made explicit by an attached label confirming an 18th October Steam release.

The game features 4K and Ultrawide support and boasts over 500 customization options.

It's been a bit of a wait, so we're happy to hear the release is getting close.
A sequel to God of War (2018), the ninth installment in the series finds Kratos and his son Atreus facing a series of events that bring about the end of days and the deaths of some of the Norse gods. Basically, Ragnarok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the nights start drawing in and the spectre of Halloween looms on the horizon, Planet Zoo is getting just a little bit spooky with the announcement of its new nocturnal-themed Twilight Pack DLC, launching on 18th October.


The big draw of Planet Zoo's DLC is always its creature addtions, and the Twilight Pack brings five new nocturnal species: the Racoon, Red Fox, Common Wombat, Striped Skunk, and Egyptian Fruit Bat. The first four of those are free-roaming, meaning you can plop them wherever you please, while the Egyptian Fruit Bat is restricted to a walkthrough exhibit.


Players looking to infuse their zoos with a touch of gothic flair for Halloween can make use of the Twilight Pack's 200 new scenery items, ranging from castle-themed building parts - including gargoyles and an imposing portcullis - to glowing pumpkins and cauldrons. Even the flora is getting a bit spooky, with Bristlecone pine trees, ivy, and bioluminescent ghost fungus.

The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it's not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn't wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I'm not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I'd say it's very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I'm 100% down for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels odd saying "Overwatch 1", but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game's tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.

The first tease from Kojima appeared at TGS 2022 back in September, with a poster featuring a silhouette with the face obscured and the words "Who AM I" printed across it (thanks, Polygon).
At PAX Australia, which is going on now, a QR Code is present that when scanned leads to an image posted on the Kojima Productions website showing an image of Elle Fanning (The Great) with the same words printed on it.

You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It's good stuff all round, frankly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specifically designed mechanical boards for Macs have long been neglected, apart from little-known Matias keyboards or Apple's own Mac keyboards in the 80s. Enter Das Keyboard to redress the balance with the amusingly named MacTigr. This keyboard offers a full Mac layout, mechanical switches, a volume knob and plenty of creature comforts - but is it worth its exorbitant $219 asking price? 
First, my credientials: as someone that splits their time between Windows and MacOS, I've been agitating for a proper dedicated MacOS keyboard to swap to. For too long Mac users have been lumbered with the runts of the litter when it comes to keyboards - the current selection is generally awash with non-mechanical options with mushier keys and less consistent key action - even Apple's own Magic Keyboards aren't all that magic. So, the MacTigr has the potential to deliver a considerable upgrade, with the functionality that Mac users rely on and the mechanical switches they don't know they're missing.
The MacTigr is a board that offers the traditional Mac layout, odd function keys and all, in a clean and sharp-looking package. The outer casing is comprised almost entirely of metal with a steel top plate and aluminium casing, which means the MacTigr features plenty of heft - it weighs in at 2.4lbs, or just over a kilo for metric users. It's remarkably well made, with no signs of deck flex in the case, even under intense typing load, and feels excellent. Despite that heft though, the MacTigr is especially slim and modern looking, especially thanks to its use of MX Low Profile switches, more of which I'll talk about in a moment.

But seconds are precious. Especially when there’s something, somewhere nearby, lurking. Waiting. Breathing. Watching. You’re pressing the skin of your face to the inside of a locker, eyeing up that terminal, knowing it’s less than 20 feet away, probably. But, moments ago, you heard the telltale ding of sinew on metal. The Xenomorph is nearby. And it’s waiting for you to make your move.

Time is running out. Both in the game, and in your real life – you need to save, and get on with that article you’re supposed to be writing. So you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and try to slink out of the little cupboard you’ve crammed yourself into as quietly as possible. A glance at your motion tracker seems to suggest you’re safe. Footsteps echoing through the deserted Sevastopol station. Breath ragged in your ears. The blinking light of the terminal closing in. Your hand on the machine. Then – fuck – it’s coming up and out of your chest. Its tail, tearing through your ribs, your lungs. That’s it. Game over, Ripley. 
Some may argue that this is appalling game design, making you gamble on whether or not you can actually save your game. You can lose hours of progress if you mess up your timing, if you gamble against Ripley’s ability to stay alive. But I think it perfectly encapsulates what makes Alien: Isolation one of the best games, ever. Even saving your game makes you think about survival – makes you think about death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths' interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the "church mystery" or "sadfutago's posts", among other monikers.

But while developer Hello Games broke from tradition for this latest releases, revealing some of its additions ahead of launch, the studio has now shared some extremely lengthy patch notes, discussing its contents in considerably more granular detail.


The top-level stuff we already knew about; as Hello Games boss Sean Murray told Eurogamer earlier this week, Waypoint - which arrives alongside a new Switch port for No Man's Sky - is less about big new additions and more about major quality of life improvements.


To that end, Hello Games had previously teased a bunch of rejigging and streamlining intended to turn No Man's Sky's last six years of updates "into a more cohesive whole", as well as a new, less grindy Relaxed mode, a Survival mode revamp, plus extensive options for custom games.

That’s why Tyler Hallada put together Modmapper, a free tool released earlier this year that shows which of the mods hosted at NexusMods affect which areas of Skyrim. Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

According to the company, it is currently experiencing an attack by a third party attempting to gain access to the Square Enix Account Management System. They are doing this by using a combination of email addresses and passwords possibly obtained from “online services of other companies."
Square advises against using the same email address and password combination for your Square Enix account as you do for other online services, as it increases the possibility of a third party gaining unauthorized access to your account. That said, you are still at a high risk of your account being accessed should your password contain an easy pattern, sequences of characters, or your DOB.

That one! The one with the robots and the Soviet Alien dot detector thing!" The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year's E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I've now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don't much like the look of that there laser bot.

Each user will also have a custom and unique ID, and once connected to the app, users will know what and when friends are playing, allowing players to jump in and game together.

It’s not often that video games set out to mimic small things. Photorealism tends to depict the world at a scale that humans can walk around in. But, swivelling a macro-lens onto that Unreal Engine camera and pointing it at digital miniatures produces a wonderful effect that makes RAILGRADE’s otherwise fairly standard route plan puzzling an absolute joy to get stuck into.


In short, it’s transportive. For me, it throws me right back to my childhood bedroom, where a constantly reconfigured TOMY train set enjoyed permanent residence on the floor, forever delivering assorted handfuls of lego bricks between the Ghostbusters fire station and a permanently downed Star Trek: The Next Generation shuttlecraft. Who knows why. The mind of a ten year-old is unknowable, even if you were one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Overwatch 2 week but not quite the week Blizzard will have imagined. The servers haven't worked, there are huge queues to play in the evening, and even when people can log in, there are overly complicated character unlock systems and bolshy Battle Passes to contend with. It's not entirely clear what's new in this second game when you can play it, either.

Overwatch 2 is overwhelmingly Overwatch. It's the same conclusion Edwin Evans-Thirlwell came to in a quick impressions piece published this week while he works on his full review. And it's hard not to agree with him. Faced with the same maps and the same characters, Overwatch 2 feels like the same game so many of us will have played so many times before. The differences are there, though, and given time, they make themselves felt. 


Overwatch 2 is the talking point of the week, then, and I've invited Edwin onto Weekly to talk about it. My other guest this week is news reporter Victoria Kennedy, who joins us to talk about Gotham Knights, Moonbreaker and CD Projekt Red as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days ago, Hello Games’ Sean Murray detailed what No Man’s Sky 4.0 update would look like in an interview with PCGamer. We’re already well aware of what’s in store, and that’s various adjustments to make the game welcoming for newcomers or returning players, or simply more engaging for veterans who believe they’ve done it all.
This includes a relaxed mode, and a survival mode, both of which offer easier and harder difficulties depending on what type of player you are. On top of that, there’s performance improvements, increased inventory space, and of course, perhaps the biggest accompaniment of the whole 4.0 update, the space-exploration title has finally arrived on Nintendo Switch.
That said, those playing the game on Nintendo Switch will not only be able to explore the vast expanse of space with responsive touch controls in handheld mode, they’ll also be able to bag themselves some freebies for supporting Hello Games’ survival game on the handheld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts have formally launched their new store client doodad after a long open beta, replacing the much-maligned Origin with something they refer to as "the EA app" (its actual name is only "EA"). They say it's faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn't really matter, as long as it's not a disaster, because it's not like you're using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-nier-automata-switch-tech-review"/>
        <updated>2022-10-07T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier Automata is one of the most celebrated last-generation action titles, marrying Platinum Games' signature stylings with inventive, varied gameplay and a mind-bending narrative. From a technical perspective though, the situation was far from ideal: the game was beset by frame-rate and image quality issues on last-gen machines, with wobbly performance coupled with plenty of aliasing. This is why the Switch port came as a bit of a surprise when it was announced a few months ago: there's a huge performance gap between the Switch and even the base last gen consoles with precious little room to cut resolution before image quality becomes unacceptably poor. This seems like one of the so-called "impossible ports" - a technically demanding title downscaled for Nintendo's hybrid console, often with somewhat mixed results. 


The challenge is clear - and it's all down to just how difficult this game was to run on PS4 and Xbox One. Despite relatively pedestrian visuals, the title targeted 900p without any anti-aliasing, with somewhat messy performance on both machines. The typical run of play was 40-60fps, with combat and open-world traversal causing issues. It's important to keep this relatively poor showing in mind, because the Nintendo Switch falls far short of those machines in raw number-crunching performance. So what kind of compromises are we seeing here? 


Relative to base last-gen consoles, the Switch release is comprehensively downgraded - though the overall image still looks surprisingly comparable. Measuring the game against its Xbox One S counterpart, the first thing that stands out is a significant reduction in texture detail. Across the board, textures are degraded, with lower resolutions not to mention simplified layers and material properties. In some areas, the textures look soupy, with no fine detail to speak of, though most of the time it's not quite as severe.

Ferret, a Zork-like text adventure, began development in 1982 for the Data General Nova 2. The game was put together by a group of software engineers from Data General’s UK-based Systems Division. Ferret only received a final functional release complete with an endgame in August this year, according to a post on the game’s Facebook community.

The game itself had received a poor reception across the board, with criticisms ranging from its monetisation model to its £60 price tag.


However, despite the fall of Babylon's Fall, the developer is not taking its eyes off any future live service games. 


In an interview with VGC, Platinum Games boss Atsushi Inaba said the team has "learned from this experience [with Babylon's Fall]" and it had not "changed [its] future plans or outlook" because of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EGX was two weeks ago, which is wild. Time has really flown by. But, there’s one game there that’s really stuck in my mind as of late — especially as I've been kicking my heels in Overwatch 2 queues and looking for a quick, competitive FPS fix in the downtime. Enter Squad Blast, which has fixed itself onto me ever since I got my hands on it back in London. It’s got the spirit of Overwatch and CS:GO, but all excitingly represented on a 2D plane. As a result, it really is quite brilliant.
I spent a good chunk of my time at EGX messing around with Squad Blast, and was fortunate enough to interview Anatolijs Ropotovs – CEO and founder of Ultrahorse – about the inspirations for the title, what the studio is hoping to achieve, and why it thinks players will hop over from some of the genre’s big hitters and try out this fresh, more 2D approach.
Squad Blast is a team-based competitive shooter, where you and your partner set out to outsmart and outgun the enemy team within short, punchy objective-based matches. It’s hero-based, which means different characters have different weapons and abilities, and even in my short hour-or-so playing it at the show I could feel the counter-pick meta bubbling behind the scenes. The sniper dominates mid-ranged rocket users, the shotgun beats out the sniper, and the rocket is damn good at cutting off offensive shotgun pushes. You can play defensive, you can play offensive, but you’ve absolutely got to play well... otherwise you’ll see the clear difference between yourself and your opponents. Like in any good competitive title.

        <link href="https://edwardbetts.com/blog/fish-shell-underscore-number-separator"/>
        <updated>2022-10-07T13:05:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In November 2021 I filed a feature request for the fish shell to add underscore as a thousand separator in
numbers. My feature request has been implemented and is available
in fish 3.5.0, released 16 June 2022.
The fish shell supports mathematical operations using the math command.
edward@x1c9 ~> math 2_000 + 22
2022
edward@x1c9 ~> 



The underscore can be used as a thousand separator, but there are other uses for a number separator. Here's a list taken
from a post by Mathias Bynens about the number separator in JavaScript:
// A decimal integer literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
1_000_000_000_000
// A decimal literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
1_000_000.220_720
// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per octet:
0b01010110_00111000
// A binary integer literal with its bits grouped per nibble:
0b0101_0110_0011_1000
// A hexadecimal integer literal with its digits grouped by byte:
0x40_76_38_6A_73
// A BigInt literal with its digits grouped per thousand:
4_642_473_943_484_686_707n 



Programming languages are gradually adding a number separator to their syntax, I think Perl was the first. Most are
languages use underscore, but C++ 14 uses an apostrophe for the number separator.]]></summary>

From Illumination's rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom through to Jack Black's Bowser, Keegan Michael-Key's Toad, Charlie Day's Luigi and - of course - Chris Pratt's not-so-novel take on Mario, there's a lot to unpack. So here's what Team Eurogamer made of the big Super Mario Bros. movie reveal.

So, after a lot of hype from a certain Mr. Chris Pratt, who assured us this trailer would blow our minds, we finally got the new teaser for Illumination's upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie and, I have to say, I kind of loved it.

A new QR code was found at the PAX Aus gaming convention, with the enigmatic words "where am I?" written across its front. The code was found next to a poster of the same cryptic silhouette.


Scanning this code then leads to a new website and a picture of, yes, Elle Fanning looking back at you, as you can see below from the shot I took on my phone when I scanned the QR code for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if you've read much about the new Batman game, Gotham Knights. I'll call it a Batman game for simplicity's sake. The truth is - as far as we've been told - this is actually a Batman game in which you don't play as Batman. Batman's dead, so instead you play as four members of the wider Bat family. In fact, this is probably what you've been reading about if you have been reading about the game.


This is all super interesting, I think. Gotham Knights is already a Batman game not made by Rocksteady, and now it doesn't have the main character either - as far as we've been told. I'm intrigued to see the results, but the whole discussion has also made me think about the first Batman game in this series, Arkham Asylum, and how you definitely play as Batman in that - except when it comes to  my very favourite moment in the game, which is also the point at which the relationship between player and onscreen avatar becomes a little more complicated.


Firstly, yes, a lot of games complicate this relationship. You control the characters in GTA, for example, but when you're driving to a mission they're talking, and they're saying stuff that is probably a surprise to you, the player, so there's that gap there to ponder. You are the people on the screen, and you must be, because you tell them when to duck, when to reload. But they have a sliver of life that you will never quite get control of, because if you did, the game's narrative wouldn't work.

First up, as this one has been garnering a lot of attention on Twitter, here is the French version of Mario making his way to the Mushroom Kingdom. Or, in this case, the Royaume Champignon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck has been out in the wild for a while now, and slowly but surely, Valve has ramped up production of the handheld system. The long wait to purchase a Steam Deck has all but diminished, with people now, finally, able to order the system without a reservation.
The reservation system for ordering a Steam Deck required those willing to wait to leave a small deposit, and placed the buyer into a queue of other reservations. The waiting period for reservations to become shipped out orders has been multiple months, however, with the Steam Deck exceeding what Valve estimated for the system, this long period of waiting has steadily been reduced.
As of right now, there simply are no reservations needed or queues when it comes to purchasing a Steam Deck. If you’re looking to buy the handheld for yourself, you can actually jump on Steam right now and order one. There’s no need to leave a deposit, nor do you have to patiently wait for that email to arrive in your inbox, inviting you to finally buy the device.

An image showing a shadowy face with the words “Where am I?” features on the standee, also tweeted by Kojima with the questions “Who is “WHERE”?”. People who scanned a QR code on the standee image were directed to another picture on the Kojima Productions site, which shows Fanning’s face in red light and the message “Who am I?”.

One of the things I am always up for in a video game is mountain climbing. Mountain climbing, rock climbing, bouldering. These are the things I wish I did in real life. It's the video game as wish fulfilment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As suggested by leaks, the next Battlefield 2042 in-game event is just over the horizon. The Liquidators is a limited-time event that introduces a new, infantry-only mode to the game.
The Liquidators is a two-week event, kicking off October 11, and ending October 25. During it, players will be able to jump into Tactical Conquest - the new Conquest variant emphasising squad play and tight infantry combat.
There are two versions of Tactical Conquest, and each will be available for a full week. During the first week, the mode will be limited to 8v8, which expands to 16v16 the following week. It's best to think of Tactical Conquest as something like Call of Duty's Domination, except tickets are counting down instead of the score going up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, is getting a third paid expansion, titled Biotech - which'll be bringing babies, mechanoids, and gene modding when it launches later this month alongside a free content update for all players.


Biotech's first big additions come in the form of children and reproduction, with colonists and outsiders able to get pregnant and give birth - either naturally or via technological means.


Once babies grow into children, they can learn through lessons, play, or by watching adults work, with players able to determine their traits and passions every few years. Children given more attention and better education are more likely to become happy and talented adult colonists - but players can alternatively skip the nuturing and use growth vats to pump out soldiers and cheap workers to exploit.

        <id>http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2022/10/06#rblpapi_0.3.14</id>
        <link href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2022/10/06#rblpapi_0.3.14"/>
        <updated>2022-10-06T22:46:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 0.3.14 of the Rblpapi package arrived on CRAN earlier today. Rblpapi provides a direct interface between R and the Bloomberg Terminal via the C++ API provided by Bloomberg (but note that a valid Bloomberg license and installation is required).
This is the fourteenth release since the package first appeared on CRAN in 2016. It comprises a nice PR from Robert Harlow extending support to B-PIPE authentication (for those who have it) along with a few fixes made since the last release in January. The last one provided from a kind assist by Tomas Kalibera who pointed out how to overcome an absolute ‘rpath’ dynamic linker instruction (and as I noticed noticed something I already did in another package – ah well) so that we no longer require StagedInstall: yes.
The detailed list of changes follow below.
Changes in Rblpapi version 0.3.14 (2022-10-05)
Build configuration was generalized to consider local copies of library and headers (Dirk in #362)


A ticker symbol was corrected (Dirk in #368 addressing an issue #366 and #367)


Support for B-PIPE was added (Robert Harlow in #369 closing #342)


The package no longer requires staged installation thanks to an assist from Tomas Kalibera (Dirk in #373)


The retired package fts is no longer suggested (Dirk in #374 closing #372)



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for the this release. As always, more detailed information is on the Rblpapi page. Questions, comments etc should go to the issue tickets system at the GitHub repo.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of behind-the-scenes chatter, Nintendo has shared the first trailer for its Chris-Pratt-starring animated Super Mario movie.


Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures' Illumination animation division. It sees Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


Since initial casting details broke last year, all has been largely quiet, but the veil of secrecy has finally been lifted today with the first official teaser trailer, which you can see below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until now, buying a Steam Deck meant first purchasing a reservation, then waiting weeks or months until you came to the front of the queue before you could complete your purchase. No longer. Valve say that they've increased their manufacturing capacity such that you can now buy a Steam Deck without a reservation.

They've also made the Steam Deck's dock available to purchase. It costs $80/£80 and has the same 1-2 week delivery estimate as the Deck itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a year of lengthy, but steadily diminishing, queues to purchase a Steam Deck, Valve has announced its impressive handheld gaming PC is now available without a reservation.


Since last July, Valve has been using a reservation system for Steam Deck orders that first required purchasers to pay a small, deductible sum to join the reservations queue then wait for an invite to make a final purchase. For some time, the wait between the two steps was upward of several months, but the gap has been steadily narrowing as Steam Deck production began to outperform Valve's estimates.


Now, some 15 months after reservations for Steam Deck initially opened, Valve has announced the queue has been eradicated. Anyone looking to acquire a Steam Deck can now do so immediately, without needing to wait for an invitation to purchase.

"We are happy to share that our Stadia players will be able to transfer their ESO accounts to PC," it continued, "bringing with them all of their progress, including but not limited to existing characters, purchased items, achievements, and inventory. Since Stadia players already play ESO on our PC servers, all of their friends and guilds will be waiting for them once they complete the transfer." Bethesda says it'll be sharing details on how to make the transfer soon.

Together We Rule follows the release of two smaller, culture-focused DLC packs for Humankind - one themed around Africa, the other Latin America - and introduces diplomacy and espionage features intended to "help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently".


These include the new Congress of Humankind - giving players the means to vote and decide on global doctrines and arbitrate international conflicts - as well as the new Embassy Quarter. The latter can be used to sign mutually beneficial agreements with other empires or force them into taking specific actions through Leverage - a special currency generated by the expansion's new Agent units that can be spent to infiltrate, sabotage, and disinform other empires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom's Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque's challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month's Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I'm sorry to say that's about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

In fact, the live service model was supposed to be used as a substitute for the traditional story campaign, where in-game events would fill in the lore of the new climate-change ridden world.


But all of that was postponed thanks to dire state of the game at launch. Now almost a year since launch and two seasons later, we finally have our first in-season event and new game mode.

Within just the last few years, we've not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers & Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they've had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

Starbreeze, best known for its development of the Payday series, fell from grace following the disastrous launch of Overkill's The Walking Dead on Steam back in 2018.


The game's failure led to severe financial issues and the exit of the company's boss Bo Andersson. Wesley Yin-Poole produced a full-length feature on the company's collapse in 2019 which I recommend you give a thorough read if you want the full context.

We're talking favourites from Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch, all rolled into one mega-bundle.
Of course, it's only a rumour, which means it could be debunked at any moment. But it did get Hayden and I – the resident codders of the RPS Treehouse – thinking. If this rumour turns out to be true, which maps would we like to see return for Modern Warfare 2?

Spider-Man Remastered is the first PlayStation game on PC to offer this option, though it looks like Trophy support isn't included. It's unclear if previous games will also be updated with this feature, or if it will be included in future releases like Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.

A survey on the official Twitter feed has asked fans if they would like to be "able to interact with [their] animal companions?"


There are then three options presented for you to choose from. These are: "Yes", "YES" (an important use of all capital letters there for emphasis) or "Yes (in the next update)!"

Headed up by Starward Industries, which is a super-group of devs who can list such esteemed projects as The Witcher 3, Dying Light, and Call of Juarez on their collective CV, The Invincible is an adventure game based on an acclaimed genre work by a celebrated Polish author which I haven’t read and neither have you.


That’s where its similarities with The Witcher games start and end. The Invincible is a landmark work of hard science fiction which explores the perils of space colonisation and the very nature of alien life: the forms it may take, whether we’d recognise it, and how our prejudices might affect our decision making when encountering it. The game of the same name is not a beat-for-beat adaptation of the book, but a re-telling centred around a new character named Yasna: a female protagonist who doesn’t exist in the novel, but has been created fresh for the game as a concession to the fact that it is no longer the mid-sixties.

Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew's is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That's one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 is out, and is having a range of serious problems in its early days. This includes a massive DDOS attack that has led to server queues up in the 40,000s, as well as a a mandatory phone verification system for players (although this has now been removed for Overwatch 1 players). However, that doesn’t mean that original Overwatch players are out of the mud quite yet, as some are finding their hero roster locked away.
This bug is likely a result of the intended new-player experience for those who weren’t Overwatch 1 players, as this group will need to grind through over 100 matches in order to unlock all of the original roster.The bad news is that it seems like the game is applying this restriction to players who are anything but new, forcing them to reboot the game as the only current fix which throws them back into the queue.
This includes Reddit user GumpaGumpa, who posted their issue onto the Overwatch 2 Reddit yesterday showing their largely locked roster. Below the original post, numerous other players express their frustration with the bug, and some even claiming a single restart didn’t help at all, leaving them still without their full arsenal of characters several hours later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we're discussing the avalance of announcements to come from CD Projekt Red, maker of The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.


Taking a leaf out of Ubisoft's recent playbook - when it lay the entirety of its Assassin's Creed plans on the table - CD Projekt Red has done similar, discussing projects which we'll see release across the whole of the next decade. There's going to be a new trilogy of new Witcher games, a Cyberpunk sequel, a new IP and various other spin-offs - though there was no word on Cyberpunk's standalone multiplayer portion, and still no firm date for The Witcher 3's long-awaited current-gen console update.

With questions still to answer about what we'd known was coming, how likely is it we'll see any of these fresh projects soon? And if not, why announce them now? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan share their thoughts.

The trailer features American rapper A$AP Rocky, who is heard narrating in the beginning of the trailer before finishing off with what appears to be a brand-new track from the rapper.

Along with this approval, CADE did touch on the more high-profile elements of this proposed acquisition, including Activision's Call of Duty franchise - a franchise which has recently felt like it's been caught up in a custody battle between Xbox and PlayStation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genshin Impact developer miHoYo has said it does not want to add further endgame content similar to the Spiral Abyss because of the "excessive anxiety" it could create for players.


Spiral Abyss is the only true endgame content for players at high Adventure Ranks. In a recent Gamespot interview, a miHoYo spokesperson was asked if there were plans to release more permanent endgame content in the "same vein".


"The Spiral Abyss is one of the most effective ways [for] players [to] test out their party composition and combat strength," miHoYo replied. "If we design another type of permanent endgame that is similar to the Spiral Abyss, it might end up creating excessive anxiety for our players - not everyone is interested in Musk Reef."

The trailer follows four different Trainers as they explore the Paldean region, showing the variety of adventuring available.


Most significant is the game's Let's Go feature that allows partner Pokémon to be sent off to battle others alone in the world, or gather items, which should make grinding much smoother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Heroes never die.” That’s Overwatch’s little mantra – a motto you’ve probably heard a million times over if you or one of your teammates has ever been a Mercy main. It sort-of became a de facto rallying cry for the game, too: no matter how many times Blizzard slowed down the drip feed of new content, it always came back. Often with a bang. Like a true hero, Overwatch – or the original Overwatch at least – could never stay down. 

That was until its own creator came along to put a bullet in its head. In order for a new hero to rise, the original one had to die. So Blizzard stood above its favourite creation, placed the cold steel to its forehead, and pulled the trigger without a second thought. In theory, what rose from the ashes would be harder, better, faster, stronger… but in reality, it’s been a pale imitation of what came before.
Overwatch 2, let’s face it, has had an appalling launch. If you’ve spent even a fraction of a second online this past week, you’ll have seen stories about the queues. Blizzard notes that a lot of the issue with logging in comes down to DDoS attacks on its servers. Fast-forward 48 hours, though, and little has changed; I have the Xbox version of the game open as I write this, and I have gone from 400 people ahead of me in the queue, to 300, to 800, and now to 1600.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has released its first gameplay trailer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which gives us our first glimpse of the first-person shooter's campaign.


The trailer largely confirms the rumours and leaks of the past few months which suggested the campaign would involve the global War on Drugs. 


Task Force 141 is deployed in an unnamed South American country, as it seeks out a terrorist that appears to be allied with drug traffickers. Essentially, the story entangles the War on Terror with the War on Drugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A PlayStation trailer listing that suggested EA Motive's upcoming Dead Space remake will launch for PS4 as well as PS5 is a mistake, Eurogamer understands. 


EA's latest trailer for the game was published today on PlayStation's official YouTube channel for Latin America, which has 664,000 subscribers, and wrongly labels the revived survival horror as coming to both PS4 and PS5. 


The listing sparked fan speculation and media reports that the game was also quietly being developed for PS4 and Xbox One.

We're still several weeks away from the launch of the game, of course, so while a dropping a launch trailer now might seem strange, it's a thing more and more publishers have been doing in recent years, mainly to ramp up pre-orders.
Love the tactic or hate it, though, this new Modern Warfare 2 trailer is good. The focus is squarely on the single-player campaign here. We get treated to plenty of new footage, showing both gameplay and cutscenes from various missions.

What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

What is the Lost Between Worlds expansion? That's a good question - since Ubisoft is yet to announce it. We've asked the publisher for more information today.


Still, details for the Far Cry 6 Game of the Year Edition are now live via listings on the Xbox and PlayStation stores. These note that Lost Between Worlds is "coming soon" - so your £100 purchase will simply grant access whenever it does become available.

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

The deal marks an increased investment in the German developer, representing the publisher's move to create a significant proportion of its business outside of Japan. 


Park Beyond will be Limbic's highest profile release so far: a theme park game where players can create bizarre attractions using the "impossification" gimmick. Bandai Namco aims for Limbic's sim games to become the new standard.

        <updated>2022-10-06T11:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first thing that hits me about Moonbreaker, the very-different-from-Subnautica game by Unknown Worlds, is how rigid and awkward it feels. It's strange because  turn-based combat games are something I'm really familiar with, but Moonbreaker takes some getting used to though, and some of that I don't like, and some of it I really, really do.

It stems from Moonbreaker being a miniatures game. A friend called it Warhammer without the licence and that's exactly what it is. You collect and paint the figurines you use in battle; figurines are the whole point, so it's not surprising they behave like them and don't move around like animated characters. They are frozen in whatever dramatic expression they've been given: cheering, charging, taking aim, whatever. And when they move, it's as if someone picked them up and plonked them down somewhere else. And when they attack, it's like a child twizzled them in an emulation of the real thing. The figurines are voiced - there's a lot of energy and character in the game - but there's no escaping you're playing an adaptation of a tabletop game. 
But the camera feels rigid too, fixed on rails you'll struggle to pull it off. It won't let you spin around the battlefield, viewing the action from varying angles, which I'd really like to do - if only to admire the figurines I've painted. But I also want it for gameplay reasons, so I can see bunched stand-offs more clearly. When large figurines stand near smaller ones it can be hard to see what's going on. As it is, I can only nudge the camera's rotation slightly before it pings back to a fixed angle, and it doesn't help much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every retro shooter straddles the line between classic and modern design, whether it's a new game built in an old engine like Ion Fury and Wrath, or a good old-fashioned murderfest that uses cutting edge tech like Amid Evil. But none walk that line as precisely as Bounding Box Software's Prodeus. This is an anachronistic high-wire act, synthesising old and new ideas in a way that is always exciting, occasionally inspired, and defies easy categorisation.


Even the base premise is wilfully elusive, although this is well in the spirit of the genre's foundational texts. You're an archetypal space marine trapped on a barren but mineral rich asteroid, where a cataclysm has resulted in an all-out war between two interdimensional factions – one representing order, and the other chaos. From your perspective, both sides are equally in your way, and will die by the hundreds, if not thousands, as you carve a path across the surface of the asteroid and beyond.


Prodeus' amalgamated personality is evident in its visual style, which mimics the 2.5D graphics of early id-tech and Build engine games then infuses it with modern lighting and visual effects. Terrain and environments are rendered in angular 3D, while objects and enemies are presented as chunky sprites (although there's an option to swap them for 3D models too). When you fire a rocket or shoot an explosive barrel, the resulting blast will illuminate the scene in a fiery orange glow, while environmental light sources glisten off gunmetal corridors and rain-slicked terrain.

Many fans have been left unable to play for long periods, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.


These issues have been exacerbated by a series of DDOS attacks aimed at the game's servers. And today, following a bruising 24 hours, Blizzard has apologised.

Blizzard argued that SMS Protect was necessary as the game transitioned to a live service free-to-play model, in order to combat "disruptive behaviour" and stop banned users simply creating a new account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to keep player accounts protected and curb in-game toxicity, Blizzard added an SMS Protect system to Overwatch 2 for players. This system required all players, across all platforms, to have a phone number associated with their Battle.net accounts.
Except, this isn’t just about protecting players; the SMS Protect system also aids Blizzard with controlling exactly who can access Overwatch 2. Blizzard has since announced it will be removing the SMS protect system for Overwatch 2 players that previously played Overwatch 1 since June, 9, 2021. If you’re not exactly sure what the deal with SMS Protect is, we’ve explained it here.
In a previous blog post detailing its Defense Matrix initiative, which is aimed at disincentivising disruptive behaviour and gameplay, Blizzard said, “SMS Protect brings meaningful change when it comes to disruptive play. This additional layer of security is an industry-proven solution in combating both cheating and disruptive behaviour, further protecting your Overwatch 2 experience from bad actors.”

But even a fast laptop is slower than a decent workstation, and if your developers want a local build environment they're probably going to want a decent workstation. They'll want a fast (and expensive) laptop as well, though, because they're not going to carry their workstation home with them and obviously you expect them to be able to work from home. And in two or three years they'll probably want a new laptop and a new workstation, and that's even more money. Not to mention the risks associated with them doing development work on their laptop and then drunkenly leaving it in a bar or having it stolen or the contents being copied off it while they're passing through immigration at an airport. Surely there's a better way?

the current version ("jdk"), 8, 11 and 17. These are all maintained in separate
Git(Hub) repositories.
It's very useful to have access to the other JDKs when working on any
particular version. For example, to backport a patch from the latest version to
17, where the delta is not too big, a lot of the time you can cherry-pick the
patch unmodified. To do git cherry-pick <some-commit> in a git repository

RVowpalWabbit is one the two packages; the other one will hopefully follow ‘shortly’. And while I long suspected linking aspects to drive this (this is an old package, newer R packaging of the awesome VowpalWabbit is in rvw, I was plain wrong here. The cause was an absolute path to an included dataset, computed in an example, which then gets serialized. As Tomas Kalibera suggested, we can replace the constant with a function and all is well. So here is 0.0.17.
As noted before, there is a newer package rvw based on the excellent GSoC 2018 and beyond work by Ivan Pavlov (mentored by James and myself) so if you are into VowpalWabbit from R go check it out.
CRANberries provides a summary of changes to the previous version. More information is on the RVowpalWabbit page. Issues and bugreports should go to the GitHub issue tracker.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals.

All this comes via a listing, still live at the time of writing, on Japanese retailer Neowing's website - which, assuming its veracity (highly likely given the nature of the assets and details included), corroborates virtually all previous rumours circulating around the game in recent months.


First is the name, Need for Speed: Unbound, which tallies with a report from Insider Gaming at the end of September, as does Neowing's listed release date of 2nd December this year.

Inquisitor - Martyr is a Diablo-esque take on the Warhammer 40,000 universe, casting players as Inquisitors who must battle their way, either solo or with friends, through a "haunted fortress-monastery which hides a terrible secret from the past".


It features cover-based combat, four classes (Psyker, Crusader, Assassin, and Tech-Adept, with the new Sororitas class due at a later date), a procedurally generated mission system, skill trees, a wide range of weapons and vehicles, two-player local co-op on consoles - as well as four-player online multiplayer - and more.

Originally slated for spring before being moved to the second half of this year, IO states that while the mode is "almost ready," there are a few more things to be certain of before Freelancer launches.
To that end, the studio plans to host a Freelancer closed technical test for the rogue-like mode. In early November, the IO will selectively invite Hitman 3 players on Steam to put the mode through its paces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells, the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has expanded once more, this time introducing a free Boss Rush mode - and an assortment of related rewards for those with sufficient skills - for players on PC.


Boss Rush mode is accessed through a basement door in the Prisoner's Quarters and features four different stages to battle through. All four stages feature back-to-back bosses to defeat, one containing three bosses, another featuring five bosses, plus two more containing three and five enhanced bosses respectively. These enhanced bosses feature "more ways to kick your ass", including new limbs, healing powers, and even some friends to help them.


Each of the four challenges feature bosses randomly selected from three tiers (although players must have encountered them in Normal mode before they appear), with three-boss challenges starting with a boss from Tier 1, then moving on to Tier 2, then Tier 3. Five-boss challenges feature two Tier 1 bosses, two Tier 2 bosses, then a final boss from Tier 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[^ Stick around after the ads for some pristine 1440p footage and a discussion about Modern Warfare 2’s place in the modern era of shooters.


As infuriating exercises in being the severalth thing in a series but having the same title as the original go, the Modern Warfare reboot wasn’t half bad. We spent a bunch of time in the multiplayer beta for MW2 ahead of the full release at the end of this month, and found a solid (if a little muddled) Call of Duty game in there.


But we have to wonder: in a world far removed from the original Modern Warfare 2, which solidified CoD’s utter dominance of the 360 era back in 2009, what place does 2022’s MW2 multiplayer have in a crowded marketplace full of free-to-play competition?

In a recent Twitter thread (thanks, Nintendo Everything), adult game publisher Gamuzumi told fans it had heard back from Nintendo after facing an unexpected delay in the launch of its most recent title, Hot Tentacles Shooter.


According to Gamuzumi, which describes itself as a "boutique publisher focused on releasing mature or 'ecchi' [softcore hentai] titles", Nintendo has now ruled that games featuring topless anime women are no longer allowed.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between EA Originals and Koei Tecmo's Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series), transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom's Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan where up to three players can battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.


Omega Force - which has previous experience in the monster hunting genre, courtesy of its two Toukiden games - has now expanded on Wild Hearts' initial reveal with seven minutes of new, largely uninterrupted gameplay footage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soccer sim FIFA 23 has been given its first patch since the Day One update, but don’t expect to encounter any earth-shattering changes when you next take to the pitch. Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

Published by EA, the game takes place in a fantasy version of feudal Japan called Azuma, a region full of scenic meadows and rich bamboo forests. The area is being ravaged by formerly peaceful, nature-infused beasts called Kemono, which are now altering their environment at the cost of citizens’ lives.
Kemono can range from from plant-infused squirrels to the massive Kingtusk wild boar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Gotham Knights, Batman is dead. "Like, dead-dead," as WB Montreal put it during our preview, and in his place comes four sub-heroes: Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing and Red Hood. These are, barring any surprises, who you will play as in Gotham Knights. I played as three of them in the preview - Batgirl and Red Hood in early game scenarios, and Robin for a late-game mission and boss fight - and I can now say with confidence that they are… fine.


It's faint praise, and I'm loath to be too harsh on Gotham Knights when we're still a few weeks away from launch. But at the moment it's underwhelming, and underwhelming in terms of real substance, rather than technical performance - it looks nice enough and ran without any hiccups while we played over streaming platform Parsec. 


What's missing is a sense of conviction. The setup sees you making a base of the Belfrey, a clock tower hideout that'll be familiar to series fans, where you can mooch about and briefly chat with the other characters, swap between them, and launch missions or an exploration of the open world of Gotham City. Gotham looks quite good, but also a little muted next to the Gotham of Rocksteady's Arkham games - especially Arkham Knight - where that glorious, gothic maximalism is replaced with more of a mediumalism. The city's deep blacks seem more like faded browns, the rain doesn't fall as hard, there's no sense of sharpness, rankness, no distinctive air of criminal filth and grime, and with a kind of unnerving clarity to it all, like an old game that's been visually "remastered" by an AI, its atmosphere lost without its textured fog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG is getting a harrowing new event this October (as is New State) thanks to a spooky new Dead by Daylight crossover event on the horizon. As part of this new promotion, players of all three games will be able to net themselves some fancy new cosmetics, as well as take part in some exclusive events. Is this better than going outside and throwing chocolate at children? We’ll let you decide.
Lets start with PUBG players. As part of the event, battle royale heads will be able to earn 4 costumes and masks, 3 new backpack skins, a pan skin and a themed name plate between October 19 - December 7. These are all based on Dead by Daylight, so you’ll be able to rep a selection of your favourite killers as you drop into the firefight below.
In addition, there’s an exclusive Dead by Daylight hide and seek in-game web event that players can jump into in order to unlock some additional goodies. Four players can access it through the in-game lobby banner, where three survivors have to escape a killer in typical Dead by Daylight fashion: throwing objects and repairing generators in order to make their escape.

Assuming the Call of Duty development cycle goes according to plan, Advanced Warfare 2 will follow up Treyarch's game, which is the next game in the franchise after this year's Modern Warfare 2.
The news comes from a Ralph Valve report, who's a leaker with a proven track record when it comes to Call of Duty scoops. According to their report, the new Advanced Warfare will be built on the updated IW 9.0 engine - the same one that powers Modern Warfare 2, and Treyarch's unannounced game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's PlayStation Stars membership program has now launched in North and South America, though some fans have been told to expect a waitlist of "about two months" after signing up.


Sign-ups are now live via the PlayStation App and PlayStation.com, Sony has said, though new members will accepted on a "rolling basis" and some should expect to be "randomly put on the waitlist". 


If you are put on the waitlist, you will be able to gain access "in about two months" from your registration date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Certain clever computer wizards have managed to jailbreak the PS5, albeit in a limited capacity where you’re only able to install software, but not launch it. Nonetheless, this limited jailbreak has allowed some out there to jump in and install the long dead but dearly missed PT onto their PS5 consoles. It’s just a shame they can’t actually boot it up and play it.
This jailbreak was released to the public by Twitter user Specter via a Github link. This jailbreak only works on PS5 consoles running the 4.03 firmware or lower, which would on be present on any PS5 that hasn't been updated past October 2021. As such, chances are the PS5 sitting next to you (if you’re lucky enough to have one) can't be jailbroken using this method.
However, if you are able to get the jailbreak working, you’re able to get into the PS5 debug menu and download various PS4 files on your system. This includes the mysterious PT, as shown by Twitter user Lance Mcdonald (see below), which was removed from sale years ago as a result of a fallout between Hideo Kojima and Konami, which resulted in the cancellation of the highly-anticipated Silent Hills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's first enthusiast-grade graphics cards are here - and on the eve of AMD and Nvidia's transition to a new generation, Team Blue has actually done well. The $289 Arc A750 and $329/$349 Arc A770 offer surprisingly strong 1080p performance, a unique mix of features and aggressive pricing that makes them well worth considering for a mid-range PC - for most gamers, anyway.  
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though. There's loads to cover here and time is short, so let's take a quick overview of the hardware, cover the software features we're most interested in and then get into the meat of this review: gaming benchmarks. 
We've got a brand new GPU test suite for late 2022, with a tranche of complete newcomers joining a remixed assortment of Digital Foundry favourites covering every major engine. It's a forward-looking test suite, with titles using modern APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan, which should give Intel a chance to demonstrate its strengths. Of course, we'll also be taking a look at performance in some classic 'banana skin' DX11 titles in our video review, where we expect Intel's first-generation Arc GPUs to have slightly more difficulty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn't a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.
Whether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond "perfectly enjoyable" into "thrilling", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

The role has instead gone to Jennifer Hale, who has voiced characters such as Commander Shephard in Mass Effect and Naomi Hunter in the Metal Gear Solid series, to name but a few.


In an interview with Game Informer, which features Bayonetta 3 as its cover this issue, director Yusuke Miyata explained that "overlapping circumstances" meant that Taylor was unable to reprise her role as Bayonetta. As such, Hale stepped in to take the place of the series' title role, with Miyata stating he felt she was a "good match for the character" (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

At least this collaboration makes some sense - both Rocket League maker Psyonix and Fortnite are products of Epic Games, which has already worked in the past to bring its two audiences together.


Now, you can drive Rocket League's most famous vehicle - the Octane - within Fortnite. As you'd expect, it behaves just as it would on a Rocket League pitch - able to boost to high speeds and rapidly climb up walls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man's Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's Dead Space remake has raised eyebrows for its £70/$70 price point on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, compared to its £50/$60 cost on Steam. 


On Steam, its £50 price sits in line with other upcoming AAA launches, such as Gotham Knights, Sonic Frontiers, The Callisto Protocol, Hogwarts Legacy and Marvel's Midnight Suns.

On console, the price point for these games varies a little more. Sonic Frontiers is £50, Callisto Protocol is £55 and Hogwarts Legacy is £60, while Gotham Knights and Marvel's Midnight Suns are £65.

With this app in play, users will now be able to see all of the channel's offerings in Ultra HD thanks to its 4K HDR playback support (the PlayStation 4 version of the app was limited to 1080p).


"A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we're excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users," said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of product and design for Disney streaming (thanks, The Verge). "The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Nintendo’s presentation on Thursday, a poster for The Super Mario Bros. Movie has been released, and it’s jam-packed with the sort of easter eggs and curious details that the average punter might miss. And let’s face it, who has time to zoom into a Twitter post? Well, luckily for you, it’s our job to do that sort of thing so you don’t have to. So, here’s 7 things we found in the Mario poster that may give us some clues as to the upcoming film’s story:

The Antique Shop’s Pixelated Goods

Could this be a clue as to the Mario movie’s canonicity within the wider continuity of the games? I can’t believe I just typed that sentence with a straight face. But hear me out: on those shelves you can clearly see switch blocks and music boxes from Super Mario Bros 3. Is this an indication that the film considers the classic games to have happened in its timeline?

Between that time and now, the CMA will be conducting meetings with the main and third parties involved with this acquisition, issuing questionnaires and verifying the information provided.

Technology manufacturers will now be required to use USB-C charging ports in all smartphones and tablets sold in the region from 2024, and in laptops from 2026. Mice, keyboards, headphones are also included.


As previously reported, the UK decided to opt out out of being included in this initiative when it was first proposed, despite its aims to cut electronic waste and generally make things a bit easier for those with a drawer full of random Lightning cables,  micro-USB and mini-USB wires.

While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we'd discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we're now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there's something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks back a friend recommended Jonathan Crary's 24/7, a short, vital book I have just finished reading. I suspect a lot of it went over my head, but the basics are pretty simple. Crary, who is a professor of modern art and theory at Columbia, makes the case that the contemporary world's focus on an endless 24/7 treadmill of consumption and toil has made sleep the true enemy of capitalism. Sleep is the last place where you cannot be sold stuff, or made to work, and so capitalism must fight sleep, and it will probably be a fight to the death.


Crary takes this argument in a number of fascinating, alarming ways. What he doesn't mention - and I understand this, I guess - is a great-uncle of mine who used to own a turkey farm, and had heard that turkeys were so stupid that when the lights went off they thought the day was over. He rigged up a system in his turkey farm, a farm which clearly should have been shut down by the authorities, in which the lights continually went on and off, the theory being that the turkeys would age by a day each time this happened, and would be ready for market sooner. I don't need to add anything at this point, but I will: my great uncle was not a very nice man and should not be interpreted as the hero of this story.


Both of these things - Crary's illuminating book and the involuntary memory about a family member that it prompted - created what is basically the single least ideal mindset in which to experience Slime Rancher 2, which is out in early access at the moment and is taking over the world. Slime Rancher 2 is a thing of joy: exploration and curiosity delivered in thick, buttery pastels. But it is also the kind of horror that Crary would potentially identify as pure capitalist indoctrination - a game that people are exposed to rather than asked to play. I don't think that would be entirely fair, but everything about this game is contradictory and challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 became available less than 24 hours ago, and as expected, there have been some teething issues when it comes to accessing the game. This isn’t something we aren’t used to by any means, but experiencing queues of up to 40,000 players at once still saw me go to bed early rather than stick around to try and play.
That said, Blizzard has acknowledged the queue times for the free-to-play multiplayer title via Twitter. Mike Ybarra, president of Blizzard, tweeted that the team was working hard to fix the server issues, and that Blizzard was humbled to see the excitement of its players.
Later, however, Mike Ybarra followed up on his prior tweet by quoting it with, “Unfortunately, we are experiencing a mass DDoS attack on our servers. Teams are working hard to mitigate/manage. This is causing a lot of drop/connection issues.”

Players have reported unexpected server errors and difficulties joining Overwatch 2 games throughout the evening following today's free-to-play launch, with some claiming to be experiencing queues of as many as 40,000 other players.


An earlier tweet by Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra acknowledged today's server woes but gave no indication they might be the result of anything other that launch day teething troubles, only thanking players for their patience and pledging to "get [them] into the fun".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of former PlayStation exclusives have been ported to PC over the past two years, and Sony seem to see the benefit of doing more. Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation Studios, says that "Further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile and into live services, that's definitely a possibility for us."

Dusk Golem's comments were posted in a thread on ResetEra where members of the forum were discussing a recent report that Death Stranding 2 would be released on Stadia, which Dusk Golem debunked.

That's according to PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst who added that the firm's live-service games may be released earlier than one year post launch.
Various first-party titles have already been released on PC, and these include Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. In the PC pipeline is Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Uncharted: The Legacy Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've begun writing up my phd and, not for the first time, I'm pondering
issues of how best to represent things. Specifically, rewrite rules.
Here's one way of representing an example rewrite rule:
streamFilter g . streamFilter f = streamFilter (g . f)

This is a fairly succinct representation. It's sort-of Haskell, but not
quite. It's an equation. The left-hand side is a pattern: it's intended
to describe not one expression but a family of expressions that match.
The lower case individual letters g and f are free variables:
labelled placeholders within the pattern that can be referred to on the
right hand side. I haven't stipulated what defines a free variable and
what is a more concrete part of the pattern. It's kind-of Haskell, and
I've used the well-known operator . to represent the two…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tequila Works, the developer behind the likes of the sublime Rime and intriguing VR murder-mystery The Invisible Hours, has confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt will be going multiplatform next year.


Gylt, an enjoyably surreal horror yarn that follows the adventures of a young girl in search of her missing cousin, launched exclusively on Stadia back in 2019. And while Tequila Works did at one point suggest a multiplatform release might eventually be on the cards, it's remained resolutely Stadia-bound in the years since.


However, following last week's announcement that Google will be shutting down Stadia on 18th January next year - a move that prompted questions as to what might happen to the cloud gaming service's handful of remaining exclusives - Tequila Works has confirmed Gylt will finally be getting a multiplatform release some time in 2023.

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I've experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King's Row and Route 66, it's like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I'm not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński has announced he'll be stepping down from his joint-CEO role - a position he's held at the company for nearly 30 years - before the end of 2022.


"I am beginning a brand-new personal chapter at CD Projekt," Iwiński wrote in a statement shared following the company's latest investor meeting, "as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint-CEO role. By the end of 2022, I'll hand over my duties to my colleagues from the board."


"For me this is a huge moment," Iwiński continued. "I've been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognised developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by millions globally. Back when Michał Kiciński and I founded the company, I don't think either of us would have been able to imagine this incredible journey, not even in our wildest dreams."

This will be our first look at the film featuring the famous plumber who "travels through an underground labyrinth with his brother to save a captured princess."
The Super Mario Bros. movie was first announced back in 2018, but it wasn't until last year that we had official casting confirmation. Chris Pratt (Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy) will lend his voice to Mario with Charlie Day (Always Sunny in Philadelphia) voicing Luigi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has revealed Sony's first-party PlayStation releases will likely take "at least a year" to launch on PC, although live-service games might come sooner.


Sony initially confirmed it was exploring bringing its first-party PlayStation exclusives to PC in March 2020, announcing that Horizon Zero Dawn would lead the charge - although it said "releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn't necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC" and that it didn't have plans to follow Xbox's lead with day-and-date PC releases.


Since then, following the successful launch of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, the number of titles joining the platform has continued to grow. Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered have already made the jump, with Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: The Legacy Collection, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure confirmed to be on the way.

And that might (and should) include the PSP games. Because they objectively kick ass.

On the partnership and revelation of the TV adaptation, Piotr Babieno shares that, “Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together. My joy is even greater because two Polish companies are taking part in production, and a series will be created on the basis of our game.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Company of Heroes 3 will not arrive this November as originally planned. Sega and developer Relic Entertainment announced this afternoon that the strategy game is being pushed back to February 23 next year.
Considering this delay comes a little over a month away from the game's original release date, and follows a few rounds of public demos, media previews and closed tests - Relic has explained why the decision was made.
According to the developer, the extra time will be spent on polishing the overall experience, fine-tuning balance, improving performance and implementing key gameplay changes based on feedback collected from insiders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced a three-month delay to Company of Heroes 3, which will now arrive on 23rd February 2023. 


Announcing the hold-up this afternoon, Sega said Relic Entertainment's real-time strategy threequel was currently "not quite up to our players' or our own high standards", with "bugs to squash, pixels to polish, gameplay to adjust and feedback to address". 


On that last point, Sega says developer Relic is continuing to react to community feedback on improvements to the game's dynamic campaign map, a stronger visual focus on "grit and details" during battles, an overhauled light system, plus tweaks to the HUD and UI.

Hadn't heard of this," to "holy video game, Batman, this is the absolute business" in the space of a free demo. This is what I experienced with Flat Eye, a story-heavy management sim where you're in charge of a super-advanced gas station, where you harvest personal data from the port-a-loos, and feed the biological matter from those same toilets into your high-tech vending machine. Mmmmm. Flat Eye, the Next Fest demo for which you can download and play right now, is from Night Call devs Monkey Moon. I liked Night Call fine, but I really love the Flat Eye demo.

We only know about the release target because EA told investors that there's a new Need for Speed coming out this calendar year.
The first shot in what's sure to be a short hype campaign for the next Need for Speed, came in the form of a nondescript tweet from the official EA account to... the official Need for Speed account. "You think they're ready, @needforspeed?" it reads.

Alice Ruppert knows a lot more about horses than I do. She's been obsessed with them ever since she was a child. She would draw them, play games about them, and many years later she would eventually make games about them. 
How she got her horse-break in games makes for a great origin story. The way she tells it, she complained so much about bad horse representation in games that eventually someone gave her a job and told her to do better, and that's what she's doing now, making Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is coming out really soon.

A jury has decided the companies must pay $3750 to Catherine Alexander, who designed tattoos for pro wrestler Randy Orton, after their likenesses appeared on Orton's character in WWE 2K16, 17 and 18.


Alexander had pushed for a higher amount, including a share of profits from the games, Reuters reported. Still, the decision appears to mark a landmark judgement that may affect future usage rights in other games in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highest praise I can lay on Cookin' with Coolio: Five Star Meals at a One Star Price is that when I went to look for my copy the other day I realised I'd leant it out to someone and would probably never see it again.


This is the life of cook books, isn't it? When they aren't in the kitchen, getting splattered with hot sauce or providing a resting place for wooden spoons, they're loaned around, pages marked, moving between hungry friends: you must read this! You must make this!


Cookin' with Coolio is where my mind went when I woke up one morning last week and learned that Coolio had died. Being a 90s person, I think this news would always bum me out. But having read and loved Coolio's cook book, I'm ashamed to say it all struck a bit deeper. Over the following days when all these stories started to come out about how brilliant Coolio was - how kind, how thoughtful and perceptive and funny - none of that was really a surprise? Why? Because I had read Cookin' with Coolio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You didn't hear it from me first, but Overwatch 2 is not Overwatch 2. It is Overwatch 2.0, a free-to-play rejig of the celebrated 2016 hero shooter with rebalanced characters, a sprinkling of new faces, modes and maps, and a predictably tedious seasonal Battle Pass system whereby unlocks are either paid for or ground out through match XP. 


Spend an hour with it and, tuned-up visuals notwithstanding, you might struggle to notice any difference beyond the charmless new monetisation elements. There's the same delightful range of MOBA-ish abilities, the same awkward pivot between cultural archetype and dodgy stereotype in the character and cosmetic design, the same sunny ambience and brilliant tactical audio, and the same rousing premise of corpo-progressive Pixar Avengers murdering each other for possession of small wagons and courtyards.


Many of the game's headline new bits are still to be developed or added, including the majority of new heroes and various much-trumpeted Player versus AI modes. I've not had much time with what does exist: the review period began in mid-September, but Eurogamer's code arrived late last week, and my existing PS4 account hasn’t transferred over to the PC review build - obliging me to jump in as a First Time User and so, limiting my access to the game's already-tiny pool of pre-release players. But enough of my petulant fist-waving! I’ll have a full review in a week or so - here are some provisional notes from the trenches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[mrcal 2.2 (the release notes are available here). This release
contains lots of medium-important internal improvements, and is a result of



Heavy dogfooding. I use these tools a lot every day, and many things are
nicer, easier and work better in 2.2 than in 2.1

Not-yet-completed cool new functionality. Some of the required internal
improvements for the big new features are being released here.




The biggest single new feature in this release is the interactive graphical tool
for examining dense stereo results: accessed via mrcal-stereo --viz stereo.



The next pressing thing is improved documentation. The tour of mrcal is still a
good overview of some of the functionality that makes mrcal unique and far
better than traditional calibration tools. But it doesn't do a good job of
demonstrating how you would actually use mrcal to diagnose and handle common
calibration issues. I need to gather some releasable representative data, and
write docs around that.



Then I'm going to start finishing the big new features in the roadmap (these are
all already functional, but need polish):



Triangulation functions in the optimization loop for efficient
structure-from-motion

Support for non-central projection to remove a significant source of bias
present in very wide lenses

Improved projection uncertainty quantification to resolve accuracy and
performance issues in the current projection uncertainty method]]></summary>

The Dragon Never Sleeps as typical of
1980s science fiction: Cook is far better known for his Black
Company military fantasy series, this is one of his minor novels, and
it's only been intermittently in print.  But I'm dubious this would have
been published at all today.



First, the writing is awful.  It's choppy, cliched, awkward, and has no
rhythm or sense of beauty.  Here's a nearly random paragraph near the
beginning of the book as a sample:



XII Fulminata!  What the
    hell?  Was some malign force ranged against him?



    That was his most secret fear.  That somehow someone or something was
    using him the way he used so many others.


    "What mischief have you been up to, Kez Maefele?"



    "Staying alive in a hostile universe."



    "You've had more than your share of luck."



    "Perhaps luck had nothing to do with it, WarAvocat.  Till now."



    "Luck has run out.  The Ku Question has run its course.  The symbol is
    about to receive its final blow."

That's an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That's about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you'll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

Fans gathered earlier today to witness the final moments of Overwatch, recording the momentous occasion for posterity. Despite its place in the gaming pantheon, though, it met an unceremonious end, blinking out of existing with a simple "disconnected" message.


A few official lobby chat server messages did at least attempt to imbue the occasion with some import, telling players, "Even the best journeys end, but a new one is right around the corner. Thank you, heroes! See you October 4th!". A final message ahead of Overwatch 1's oblivion simply read, "See you on the other side".

Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, once again putting players in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke as they journey through the Necromorph-infested mining ship USG Ishimura. This time, though, EA Motive is attempting to bolster the fear factor on modern systems with enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks including improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Since confirming a Dead Space remake was in the works last year, EA Motive has been unusually open about its development process, detailing the project's progress in a series of livestreams focusing on gameplay changes, audio, and art.

Acquisitions haven't just been limited to the likes of developers and publishers, however, with the host of various fan wiki pages - Fandom - acquiring Giant Bomb, GameSpot, MetaCritic, GameFAQs, Comic Vine, Cord Cutters News, and TV Guide.
Fandom is something that'll be familiar to most of us. There's a rather high chance then when you googled that character in that Rings of Power show everyone is talking about, you wound up on a Fandom webpage. It now appears that Fandom is stretching its wings and approaching pop culture media with open arms, literally.

The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like "Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries might be abandoning its custom Slipspace Engine for Unreal Engine.


This comes from journalist Jeremy Penter (thanks VGC), who wrote yesterday (October 2), "I can only confirm that many sources are saying this and very clear that it's already been decided and Halo is for sure switching to Unreal. I feel like it's time for other switches behind the scenes including people leaving and their past problems. Unreal is a great choice."


It's not uncommon for developers to switch engines if they find it isn't working particularly well, like when Kingdom Hearts 3 switched from Square Enix's quite at-the-time broken Luminous Engine to Unreal Engine 4. The awkward thing is that this engine was meant to power the future of the Halo series, which if the reports are true, clearly isn't something it will be doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retro Studios, the team behind Metroid Prime and Donkey Kong Country Returns, once pitched a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics.


This project was dubbed Heroes of Hyrule, and would not have had Link as the main character. Rather, the Hylian hero would have turned up as an NPC. 


Per YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming, which got its hands on Retro Studios' original pitch, Heroes of Hyrule would have told the story of a magical book.

So far, Bungie, IO Interactive and Ubisoft have issued statements to reassure Stadia users that they’re investigating ways to salvage their saves. It’s a welcome development following Google’s sudden shutdown revelation.

When Black launched in 2006 for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it promised to be Criterion's revolutionary take on the FPS genre - just as Burnout had won legions of fans for the studio's version of racing. 


The game recieved largely positive reviews, though early plans for a sequel never materialised. Some who worked on the game, including its namesake Stuart Black, later left to make Bodycount - a spiritual successor developed by Codemasters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember in Dead Space, if you messed up, you’d see your mentally deranged, long-suffering player avatar Isaac Clarke get impaled through the eye by a massive needle? Or fully decapitated by a horrible alien? Or sucked out into the vacuum of space without a helmet? It almost felt as if he were the plaything of a sadistic god; torturing him for the entertainment of an audience of PS3 and 360 players, safely tucked into a little nest on their sofas.

That level of sadism hasn’t gone away in Glen Schofield's – co-creator of Dead Space and its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol. In fact, it seems like he’s eager to get even more indiscriminately violent, this time. In an interview with Mark James, chief technical officer at Striking Distance and second-hand man to Schofield, I learned that The Callisto Protocol wants you to die. A lot. And it even rewards you for seeing all the gruesome ways your new interactive plaything, one Jacob Lee, can be offed.

“This is a hard game, you are going to die a lot,” says James. “But in dying, at least, we can give you a cool way to go.”

        <updated>2022-10-03T14:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Stadia finally met its demise last week. After an unsuccessful launch with general apathy from the audience, there's an argument that the platform was doomed right from the very beginning - despite Google itself investing a gigantic amount of cash into the hardware and various publishing deals. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Stadia shut down its own development studio, while the logical evolution of the platform - as a 'white label' cloud system that could be used by publishers - wasn't really compatible with the Linux/Vulkan foundation. Features failed to materialise (remember being able to access a game state by sharing a link?) while there were always doubts about the 10.7 teraflops of GPU power. If graphics performance was so high, how come Xbox One X at 6TF produced superior results? Was that GPU actually virtualised over two users? I'd love to know for sure.
The thing is, as many have stated, Stadia had much to commend it in terms of actually delivering a decent enough streaming experience - markedly better than xCloud in terms of quality. Regardless, the system did not attract much interest and it's time to face realities about the actual viability of cloud-based platforms in general. 
Let's start with the technological arguments first. Put simply, if the platform holder is not responsible for the quality of the experience from beginning to end, there will always be problems. I've tried Stadia and xCloud on a 30Mbps fibre connection - and they simply did not work. I upgraded to Starlink and that didn't work either. Only now, with the arrival of fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) and gigabit internet does it actually work for me. My experience won't be the case for everyone, but the point is, there's no way to 'debug' it and make it work. There are other technological limitations too in a bandwidth-constrained scenario - if I'm playing Stadia and someone else in the home decides to download a game or even just watch Netflix, there are going to be issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A game that was previously meant to have been an official Dune adaptation that was ultimately cancelled has been released under a fresh name 20 years later.


You might have heard about the upcoming open-world survival MMO based on the Dune series that's slated for PC and current-gen consoles, but quite frankly it's got nothing on the unreleased GBA game Elland: The Crystal Wars. Oh, you haven't heard of Ellan? Well, there's a small chance you might have heard its original name, Dune: Ornithopter Assault (thanks PCGamer).


Elland, as it is now known, was meant to come out in 2002 from Hungarian developed Soft Brigade, who was supposed to be working on it with Cryo Interactive. The problem? Cryo Interactive declared bankruptcy, meaning Ornithopter Assault was unfortunately cancelled, even though it was basically finished.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony sounds like it's gearing up for the eventual release of the PS VR 2, as it plans to make two million units by March next year.


This comes from Bloomberg, who says that people familiar with the situation provided them this information. Mass production apparently began last month (September), and as of yet there hasn't been any supply chain issues. It's also noted that the production figure might change depending on the headset's sales momentum when it's released early next year, whenever that might be.


According to the report, Sony's roadmap for the PS VR 2 is predicting a much greater popularity than the original PS VR for the PS4. The company apparently hopes that big name titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain that draws on pre-established IP will bring players in, even with the general rise in living costs.

Beyond Good & Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, and has been in development ever since. This 14-year-long period of development has managed to overtake the previous record holder, Duke Nukem Forever, which finally released in 2011 after having been announced in 1997.
The original game, Beyond Good & Evil, launched in 2003 as a third-person action game. Coming from Michel Ancel, the mind behind the Rayman series, the game follows reporter and martial artist Jade as she attempts to uncover a sinister, ongoing alien plot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When action RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn was revealed in March, its cinematic trailer struggled to conjure up anything more than a slight tinge of excitement. Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the "Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn't it?" category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year's Gamescom, and chat to A44's CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I'd expected, honestly, and I've come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From today you can sign up to Eurogamer's Supporter program and get your first month for £1, opening up ad-free browsing and access to the weekly Essentials newsletter that recently almost had Edge deputy editor and friend of the site Chris Schilling have an accident. You can't say fairer than that, surely. 


It's been a year since we launched the Supporter program, and it's seen the return of regular weekly podcasts, the Off-Topic series and Bertie's wonderful One-to-One series where he's profiled in-depth legends such as Ken and Roberta Williams and Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. 


For £1 (or $1, in a neat conversion thanks in part to our tanked economy) you'll get Standard supporter access, which will give you the site ad-free as well as the weekly Essentials newsletter plus 'Supporter' status on comments - so you can shout 'slow news day?' with added authority. After the trial period it's £3.99 per month for Standard Supporter status, with the Premium tier which opens up the bi-weekly Off-Topic pieces and early access to the Weekly and One-to-One podcasts coming in at £5.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears that three members of Disco Elysium developer ZA/UM have "involuntarily" left the company.
This comes from a recent Medium post from Martin Luiga, co-founder and secretary of the ZA/UM cultural association. As a note: the post has announced that the ZA/UM cultural association has been dissolved. This association was an art collective, and was not directly responsible for development of the game, as ZA/UM the company still exists. In the post, Luiga also revealed that ZA/UM Studio founder and Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov haven't been at the company "since the end of last year."
Rostov later confirmed the news on his personal Twitter account writing, "We confirm that we are no longer at the studio," on behalf of himself, Kurvitz, and Hindpere. Luiga noted in the post that the "their leaving the company was involuntary," though didn't elaborate much in the post about why this took place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been another busy year for No Man's Sky. Not only has the exploratory space sim received three significant updates in 2022 - delivering some of the most meaningful revisions it's yet seen its six years of post-launch support, developer Hello Games has been working behind-the-scenes on bringing the game to a number of new platforms in the not-too-distant future: Switch, PSVR2, iPad, and MacOS. Of those, Switch comes first, arriving on Nintendo's console - alongside a major 4.0 update for all players - this Friday, 7th October. Ahead of release, Eurogaemr sat down with Hello Games boss Sean Murray to discuss the 'madness' of porting to Switch, No Man's Sky's eagerly anticipated 4.0 update, the studio's future, and more.

ON THE STATE OF THINGS IN 2022
 
Somewhat incredibly, it's been over six years since No Man's Sky's infamously rocky launch, during which time the studio has released a staggering 20 free updates, massively changing the trajectory of the game, both in terms of its scope and reception. "In general," Murray tells me when I ask about the studio's outlook in 2022, "I think we're a really happy team. I think we're sort of the happiest and the most productive we've been in the last five or six years… The launch of No Man's Sky, if I was to plot that on a graph, it was maximum stress, and there's been a gradual but steady improvement year-on-year in how we do things and within the team. I think we're enjoying it, you know."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-profile mod maker Lance McDonald has released footage of what looks to be a working PlayStation 5 exploit that leaves the console "jailbroken". 


McDonald's video appears to show custom code being read by a PS5 through an exploit in its online User Guide. Once run, the console is able to access debug settings and then install the infamous PT demo - which is, of course, no longer available under normal circumstances.


So, how bad is this for Sony? Well, for now, the use of this exploit is limited. Reportedly this method is still "fairly unstable" and offers "read/write access, but no execute" - so you could download the PT demo, for example, but not yet play it.

This month I accepted 226 and rejected 33 packages. The overall number of packages that got accepted was 232.
All in all I addressed about 60 RM-bugs and either simply removed the package or added a moreinfo tag. In total I spent 5 hours for this task.
Anyway, I have to repeat my comment from last month: please have a look at the removal page and check whether the created dak command is really what you wanted. It would also help if you check the reverse dependencies and write a comment whether they are important or can be ignored or also file a new bug for them. Each removal must have one bug!

While Google confirmed it will refund all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store, users have been left concerned about their in-game data. 


Thankfully, developers are trying to ensure these players are not going to see their efforts wasted when Stadia ultimately closes its doors.

Originally revealed by MP1st, this remaster will allegedly bring Zero Dawn closer in terms of visuals to its successor, Forbidden West. 


While, at the time of writing, it is unclear whether this is a "from the ground up" remake of the 2017 title, it is claimed that this version of Zero Dawn will see new character models, improvements to the game's lighting system and animations, and "overhauled textures".

    Not a muscle moved on Rust's face.  There was a clink as
    Vimes's badge was set neatly on the table.



    "I don't have to take this," Vimes said calmly.



    "Oh, so you'd rather be a civilian, would you?"

The only issue is that some firmware files are still missing and I had to install them manually.
Updates are needed for the firmware-amd-graphics package (#1019847) for the Radeon 680M GPU (AMD Rembrandt) and for the firmware-atheros package (#1021157) for the Qualcomm NFA725A Wi-Fi card (which is actually reported as a NFA765).
s2idle (AKA "modern suspend") works too.
For improved energy efficiency it is recommended to switch from the acpi_cpufreq CPU frequency scaling driver to amd_pstate. Please note that so far it is not loaded automatically.
As expected, fwupdmgr can update the system BIOS and the firmware of the NVMe device.]]></summary>

For some reason, back at the Games Developer Conference in 2019, Google decided to put on a small exhibit that featured the E.T. game for Atari, the Sega Dreamcast, and the Nintendo Power Glove. The exhibit was meant to tease the Stadia, Google's cloud-based platform, but the through line of these three icons of gaming is that they were all notable failures. And now, you can own these very items, with your money going towards The Video Game History Foundation!


As reported by Kotaku, VGHF founder Frank Cifaldi recently posted about these three items, as they were loaned to Google by the organisation. "Remember when Google Stadia had that GDC display where they sat it next to three of gaming history's most famous failures?" wrote Cifaldi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to tell people to never mention Resident Evil 5 or 6 in my presence. There wasn’t any real reason, other than the fact that I’d previously felt these games were one big letdown for the whole Resident Evil series. This sentiment is shared by many, but over time – and as of today, 10 years since it was first released – I’ve come to appreciate Resident Evil 6. Even if I can’t get into it.
I was a child when I first picked up a copy of Resident Evil 6 from a market stall down an alley in Yorkshire. It definitely wasn’t legitimate, but a younger version of myself was fascinated by the cover art (little did I know what everyone else thought of it at the time) and all the Resident Evil gameplay I’d grown up watching, thanks to my parents. I was, by some margin, too young to play Resident Evil 6, but my dad let me get a copy anyway, and I instead was allowed to watch him play it. Seems like a win-win for him, if you ask me.
Later down the line, I tried it for myself on Xbox One after having played Resident Evil 7 and more recently on Nintendo Switch – only to drop the game within the first couple of hours. I did this on more than one non-consecutive occasion, bouncing off the game within a few hours each time. The control scheme felt more awkward than ever before, and if I wanted to complete constant QTEs I’d rather play something from The Dark Pictures Anthology. For the most part, playing Resident Evil 6 felt like a chore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra and scientific computing. It aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use, has a syntax deliberately close to Matlab, and is useful for algorithm development directly in C++, or quick conversion of research code into production environments. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 1023 packages other packages on CRAN, downloaded 26.4 million times (per the partial logs from the cloud mirrors of CRAN), and the CSDA paper (preprint / vignette) by Conrad and myself has been cited 497 times according to Google Scholar.
This release reflect as new upstream release 11.4.0 Conrad made recently. It turns out that it triggered warnings under g++-12 for about five packages in the fortify mode default for Debian builds. Conrad then kindly addressed this with a few fixes.
The full set of changes (since the last CRAN release 0.11.2.4.0) follows.
Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.11.4.0.1 (2022-10-01
Upgraded to Armadillo release 11.4.0 (Ship of Theseus)
faster handling of compound expressions by sum()


extended pow() with various forms of element-wise power operations


added find_nan() to find indices of NaN elements


Also applied fixes to avoid g++-12 warnings affecting just a handful of CRAN packages.



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.

While No More Heroes 3 was meant to be the last entry in the series, Suda51 hasn't necessarily ruled out another game somewhere down the road, though it sounds like it would be quite a long road if it ever did happen. The director recently spoke with GNN about the most recent game, asking if it's possible we'll see Travis Touchdown once more. 


"Yes, that’s right, Heroes No More 3 is Travis’ last battle,” Suda said (translations via VGC). "Nobody could say what’s going to happen 10 years from now, and I can’t say either. If there’s a big fan outcry, Travis might be back. Just like Tom Cruise came back as Maverick."

If I had a nickel for everytime Ed Sheeran has collaborated with Pokémon, I'd only have two nickels, but it's weird that it happened twice. Last time the ginger singer-songwriter appeared in the world of pocket monsters was in the mobile game Pokémon Go, where he held a special performance. This time it's for a new song called Celestial, which for the most part sounds like your average Ed Sheeran song.


The music video itself doesn't have too much of a story, and mostly just shows Sheeran going round parts of Richmond Hill, apparently, interspersed with animated bits of your favourite gen one Pokémon causing chaos, like setting his house on fire, or a Snorlax causing a taxi to literally go flying off into the sky.

After failing their San Andreas driving test, redditor MotorDesigner reached out to the GTA subreddit for advice on the best way to get around the city without a car - legally, in other words, even though the concept is comically novel in any GTA game, of course.

Admittedly, the in-game driving test doesn't look too troublesome - questions include when it's permissible to run a red light, what the correct driving position is, and how best to drive when "getting serviced orally by a girl while driving" - MotorDesigner failed to meet the San Andreas Department of Motor Vehicles' low, low standards, and therefore cannot drive legally in the city.

There comes a point when something leaks so much that you'd assume an official reveal would just take place, regardless of the timeline. Not the case for Returnal, as a brand new leak is here, shared via a YouTube video in an icon-era forum post (thanks, PCGamesN). The video has been taken down now, but not before people could clock some of the settings in the video.


Settings apparently included things like shadows, lighting, ray tracing, as well as a "screen optimisations" toggle, all of which sounds pretty par for the course settings for a PC game. It was also spotted that the game has a Nvidia DLSS graphics option, which will require a Nvidia GeForce graphics card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios has revealed what looks to be its first game, The Finals, an absolutely chaotic looking first-person shooter.


Revealed earlier this week, The Finals is a squad-based, free-to-play multiplayer shooter with inspiration from films like last year's breakout hit Squid Game, and dystopian classic The Running Man. The first trailer gives off an impressive first look, with what looks to be completely destructible environments, and enemies that burst into coins when you take them down. And you can already sign up to take part in the game's playtest, though the closed alpha is only running until tomorrow, October 3.


According to the studio's creative director Gustav Tilleby, The Finals is "a hero builder, not a hero shooter," going on to say the team wants "to build a game that provides players with the tools to meaningfully interact, change, and use their world. So, this is a shooter; it’s a game where aiming and shooting is important. But it’s also a game where the players can use the environment, and adapt to changes in the environment" (thanks, Polygon).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of pre-release video games suffer the fate of becoming the subject of memes. Assassin’s Creed has come under fire for melting NPC faces, and many a ‘visual downgrade’ has launched campaigns of know-it-all fans to drone on about despicable devs. But one of the funniest of all time is this week turning a decade old: Resident Evil 6’s logo.

The logo, of course, is quite innocuous in nature. Resident Evil is a game about viruses, and the logo is meant to resemble a virus under a microscope or whatever. I get it. I see it. But back in the run-up to Resident Evil’s release, people saw something else entirely.
They saw a giraffe, being fellated by a doubled-over figure. And now I’ve said it, even those of you who weren’t terminally online in 2012 probably see it too. The giraffe BJ logo cannot be unseen, like a debauched Rorschach test.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese megacorp Tencent is reportedly "resetting its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy" by focussing on "buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies".

According to Reuters, Tencent traditionally acquired minority stakes and was content with being a "passive financial investor", but it is now "aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets", chiefly in the "core gaming sector". Metaverse assets are also reportedly of interest to Tencent. 

Citing "four people with direct knowledge of the matter", Reuters adds that the shift in Tencent's M&A strategy "comes as the world's number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games" and follows regulatory issues in its home country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed a new co-op shooter currently titled Project U, and you can sign-up to playtest it now.


Details on this Project U are currently very vague, with the game's page saying that Ubisoft has "been exploring a new concept of session-based co-op shooter, where many players unite to prevail against an overwhelming threat!" You probably couldn't be less clear than that on pitching a game, considering that's an age old concept.


A piece of concept art has been shown off which you can see above, which is admittedly quite pretty, with the character designs having a toned-down Apex Legends vibe. The characters seem to be facing off against some kind of robot army, but aside from that we probably won't know more until Ubisoft shows off more (or someone leaks the closed test gameplay).

In a series of messages shared on Twitter, Dandy @ 6.2 –  who clarifies that they are "not a victim in this" but is "speaking out for a friend who IS a victim who otherwise felt like she had no voice" – posts a number of incriminating messages that intimate that despite reporting him, the alleged "sex pest" known as Charcoal Salamander had yet to be stripped of his "admin" role on the server. 

"So who else knew that the Phasmophobia devs are housing a sex pest in their official discord by keeping him admin and refusing to take any claims against him seriously because I sure do now," tweeted Dandy @ 6.2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legacy of Kain could see some kind of return, as a recent survey from Crystal Dynamics is asking fans about the series.


Earlier this year, Square Enix sold off a number of its IPs and a few of its studios to Embracer Group, which included the rights to Legacy of Kain, as well as Crystal Dynamics. Of course, that led some fans to hope that this could mean some kind of revival for the series, as what better time is there than now? Well, Kain fans might be in luck, as Crystal Dynamics has released a survey (which you can fill in here) asking some questions that certainly make it seem like it's interested in bringing the series back.


The survey asks a variety of questions about the series, obviously, and if like me you haven't played the games but have heard of them, it does ask why you haven't. It also more vaguely asks you about vampire games as a whole, and what kind of features in vampire games you enjoy.

First announced back in July, PlayStation Stars has now launched in Asia this week, with the confirmation that the loyalty program will come to North America and Europe in October. However, as reported by VGC, top members of the program are supposedly being given priority when it comes to customer support, which a number of players aren't happy with.


PlayStation Stars apparently has a four tier system that players can progress through by purchasing games and earning trophies. The fourth and highest tier requires you to buy four full-price games on the PlayStation and accrue 128 rare trophies. If a player manages to do this, they'll net a commemorative collectible, and according to Sony, "when contacting PlayStation Customer Support," tier four players "will be given priority in the chat order."

        <updated>2022-10-01T11:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a weird way, I feel ever so slightly sorry for the team of students who made Dorfromantik. Call it Joseph Heller Syndrome: first time out and they've made a classic. Does that leave them confused? Fearful? I suspect not, and this is why I only feel ever so slightly sorry for the team. The bad news is they've made something that will be hard to top, but the good news is that they have made something that will be hard to top. They have brought happiness to hundreds of thousands of us around the world. That kind of feeling sticks around, I think.


I play Dorfromantik an awful lot. It's a hex-based tile game about making landscapes. You get a stack of tiles with little rivers, train tracks, forests, villages, grass or farmland on, and you plonk them down. Quests appear to connect certain amounts of a certain type of landscape, and these quests, once fulfilled, give you more tiles. Eventually, though, you run out. Game over. Defeat? Not really, because you've been making a landscape all this time, worrying about the details, and once you're out, the landscape is finished. You get to see the whole thing as if for the first time. You made that!


Dorfromantik has just landed on Switch, which explains why I'm doing what I'm doing at the moment. I'm trying to unlock the Midwinter biome. Biomes are unlockable prizes that give the landscape a certain colour scheme or vibe. Midwinter does what you'd expect it to: it makes it look like winter. But more than that it transports me to Christmas, and to the bookshelves where the Christmasest book of all time lives, John Masefield's The Box of Delights. Christmas in the countryside! Dorfromantik is the most Masefield game of all time when you're playing with Midwinter. You hover above the landscape, above the woods and fields and little copses. I feel a bit like Santa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dome Keeper divides me. There's a part of me, each time I play, that's really happy to return, to feel the ground give under my drill, to hoist my mined resources triumphantly to my command centre and turn them into upgrades to improve my base. This time, I tell myself, I will build better and survive longer and make my dome's defences impenetrable. This run will be the one.
Then, inevitably, it isn't. Just as I get some real momentum going, a particularly savage wave of shadowy monsters overwhelms me, from both the air and ground, and my precious dome cracks and breaks and I am done for. Game over, try again. And the other part of me is peeved it failed. But I know this is how it goes, that these games are about trial and error and experimentation, and feeling your way to winning combinations of upgrades, so I grit my teeth and excavate the ground beneath my dome again.
But each time I repeat the cycle, some of the sheen fades, because the core activity in the game, digging, doesn't really change. Every time I face it anew, it feels more like the laborious work it is, and I know it will be a while before I unlock the upgrades that make light of it. And just as I do, just as I build up that sense of momentum again, the inevitable overwhelming wave of enemies comes and I am dead again, and my willingness to start over wanes.

specifically those created by master craftsman Tim
Pope. Off and on since then I've reviewed
the other plugins I use and tried a few others, so I thought I'd
write about them.


automatic colour name colouring
vim-css-color is a simple plugin that
recognised colour names specified in CSS-style: e.g. 'red', '#ff0000',
'#rgb(255,0,0)' etc., and colours them accordingly. True to its name,
once installed it's active when editing CSS files, but it's also supported
 for many other file types, and extending it further is not hard.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life's biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren't your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an odd full-circle moment for me that the least surprising bombshell news of all time – Stadia’s unceremonious cancellation – lands just a week out from EGX. The Eurogamer Expo (as it was still called back then) of 2011 was more or less the start of my career in games coverage, and it started when I managed to get an interview with OnLive’s Senior Vice President John Spinale, a smooth-talking American businessman of the kind I had up to that point only encountered via the medium of television. And always as a villain, even in shows produced by smooth-talking American businessmen.


Spinale, though, was extremely nice. He could tell I’d never interviewed anyone before, and knew how to set people at ease. Within seconds, it felt like a normal chat with someone you met down the pub. The sheer gulf of wealth disparity between us didn’t seem to matter. John was excited to tell me about OnLive, this strange new concept that was going to disrupt the gaming business, and I was excited to hear about it.


It was, and is, a brilliant concept, and the basic pitch for OnLive pretty much applies to the Stadia platform which died a decade later: imagine never having to buy new hardware. That was the first thing that appealed to me, a potless call centre worker at the time, who saw the looming new generation of consoles as less of an exciting new future and more of a £400 tax on joy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we're discussing the failure of Stadia, and why Google's cloud gaming gamble struggled from the start.


The announcement of Stadia's demise came as a shock to some - including many developers with titles only weeks from launch - yet still feels like it was on the cards for some time. After a rocky launch and the closure of Google's internal game development studios, what future did Stadia have left? Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson weighed in earlier today with his thoughts.

Could Stadia have been a success? What does this all mean for game preservation? And if Google failed, with all of its billions, what future does cloud gaming have elsewhere? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, and Liv Ngan share their thoughts.

Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It's not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google's own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

The YouTuber, who has uploaded their videos to the channel Re-Imagined Games, started work on the remake over two months ago.

In order to create the game, they've had to learn Unreal Engine 5 with zero experience in video game development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol gets constantly compared to Dead Space – and it makes sense, really. A lot of the developers are the same, a lot of the core ideas are the same, and it even looks quite similar, really. But this new venture from young developer Striking Distance is doing more with its horror than Dead Space could back in 2008; we’re 14 years down the line, now, and technology has come a long way. 

Striking Distance really cares a lot about horror. The staff have been ruthless in studying the psychology of fear, and have boiled down the tenets of human dread to how we respond to atmosphere, tension, brutality, helplessness, and humanity. Taking each of these five strands and tinkering with them individually, Striking Distance reckons it’s made one of the scariest games ever made – no matter what your own personal tolerance for horror is.
Why is the developer so confident? A lot of it comes down to its tech. Mark James, chief technical officer at the studio, tells me in an interview that new-gen games can do things that just weren’t possible, even a few years ago. Whilst “50% of horror is in audio,” James assures me that a large portion of The Callisto Protocol’s dread comes from its, frankly, sadistic AI.

According to a new report from 9to5google, the project received initial approval but as it was intended to be a strictly single-player experience (instead of the asynchronous multiplayer in Death Stranding), the Kojima collaboration was cancelled as Google believed there was no longer a market for solo games.



Despite reaching the early stages of development, the project was reportedly cancelled by Stadia's general manager Phil Harrison in mid 2020 following the first mockups.

Both combined form a significant number of players, and most of them don't have good things to say.
At the time of this writing, the game has nearly 1,500 reviews on Steam. The overall rating is currently sitting at Mostly Negative, which is not a good look.
Looking at the reviews themselves, there are two main issues that keep cropping up. The first has to do with the game's anti-cheat software, which errors out for some players when launching the game. Without the anti-cheat running in the background, you won't be able to play FIFA 23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s now official, and irrefutable: Lego is no longer just for children. This has always been the case, of course, but in recent years the company itself has started to embrace this fact. First there was ‘Creator Expert’, a line of larger, more complicated and expensive sets. Then came adult-driven packaging, signaled by sleek black boxes and a marketing campaign that gleefully declares ‘Adults Welcome’. Like a lot of the best kids’ toys, Lego is for kids first – but is perfectly good for adults, too.

The Lego Group’s latest foray into the world of sets aimed at those hurtling towards their middle age at alarming speed is set 10306, the Atari 2600. This is exactly what you think it is – an almost but not quite real-life scale model of one of the most significant consoles in gaming history, dating all the way back to 1982.
Truth be told, the 2600 is quite a bit before my time (my first console was a Mega Drive), but I’m nevertheless definitely squarely in this set’s target audience: a video game nerd who also loves and collects complex-scale Lego, with an appreciation for the artistry of the older video game consoles. I mean, the machine has a wood grain finish, for goodness sake. You just don’t get that any more.

In a recent blog post shared on EA’s website, those interested can delve into ‘Inside Dead Space #1: Remaking a Classic’, in which Motive explains what it believes is key to bringing back and remaking such an iconic title.
First things first, the most important thing for Motive is to stay true to the original title, and this is without a doubt, what many fans of the original Dead Space are looking for. Senior producer Philippe Ducharme says, “We look at the original game with the utmost respect.”

We’re playing an away match against the Under 9 Tigers, and I’m in goal, being the team’s only goalkeeper, and despite my repeated request for new kneepads being consistently denied. “Ain’t got the funds, lad” was the constant refrain from the manager, Keith, ever clad in his suede coat, gold chains, and cashmere polo neck: the standard uniform at the time of people who had large status in small towns.
Last minute penalties. Unprotected joints. A striker four years my senior, having been kept back several years in school on account of his behavioural issues. Why his academic progression was reflected by the local football league is and will remain a mystery, but you must accept it for the purposes of this narrative. The point is: he was three times my size, and his legs were pneumatic pistons that could boot my head clean off and barely notice.
Mercifully, he booted the ball, rather than my skull, which was saved from his kinetic anger only by virtue of not being the object on the ground in front of him. The ball soared toward the back of the net, and would have punched a hole through the stand and into the dry cleaners across the main road outside, were it not for my left knee. My unprotected left knee. Which, as it happens, did not impede the ball’s journey into the net.

Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of Hands is a fairly "does what it says on the tin" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill "a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some console reveals just hit different. I remember queuing around the sun-drenched, weed-stench streets around San Francisco's Moscone Centre to get into GDC 2019's big Stadia show, the crazy rumours that spin up in the line for events like these - maybe it was the effect of that heavy smoke in the air, but someone told me Google had paid Sega big money to get a new OutRun as an exclusive, and I was somehow convinced - soon punctured by the bizarre reality.
Outside the hall, in an ominous show of forbearance as well as an example of how ill-conceived some of Google's ideas were, was assembled some of video game's most famous failures, with four plinths displaying a Dreamcast, Nintendo's Powerglove and Atari's ET with the final display left empty with a simple 'Coming Soon' for the soon-to-be-announced Stadia. Amidst all the bluster that would follow, it was the one thing from that event that would ring true. 
It's easy to be cynical about Stadia, and there was plenty of scepticism going around at the time of its reveal. Google's track record with product launches is spotty at best, with a rich history of big ideas being introduced before being tossed aside out of apparent boredom. The level of investment with Stadia, though, was simply bonkers. Millions was paid out to secure big blockbusters like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Cyberpunk 2077, while exclusives were secured from such talented studios as Q-Games, Splash Damage and Tequila Works. It felt, for a short while, that Google was taking this all very seriously - and how exciting it was to have a genuine new player in the game.

Quality assurance tester Mackenzie Clifton has spoken publicly to Axios about their departure from Nintendo of America, and revealed both the question on unionisation they asked, as well as the "confidential information" they were accused of leaking. 


During a January company Q&A with Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser, Clifton says they submitted the following question: "What does NoA think about the unionisation trend in QA in the games industry as of late?"

Yesterday Google announced the end of Stadia, its cloud-based streaming service. Despite ambitions of creating exclusive games, in 2021 its internal studios were closed leaving third-party developers to provide the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Admittedly, my expectations for NieR: Automata on the Nintendo Switch were quite low. I love Nintendo’s handheld more than most, picking it up near enough every day, but I’m also quite accustomed to it’s limited performance capabilities (as anyone that picked up Dark Souls on the platform will tell you).
So, when I had the opportunity to play NieR:Automata on Switch this past week, I began the download with a quiver of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ to hand. Yet, while I’m only about eight hours into Yoko Taro’s unsettling masterpiece, I can’t wait to see it through to the end (or 26 ends, in this case).
Just yesterday, we saw the Anniversary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim come to Switch, and this is one of many huge titles that has been ported to the handheld since its release in 2017. There’s also Dark Souls, Wolfenstein, and The Witcher 3, to name but a few triple-A juggernauts on the hybrid home console/handheld device. If you’ve picked any of these games up, you’ll know that they certainly feel compromised on the Switch compared to other platforms.

There was a nice buzz about EGX London this past weekend, a whiff of positivity about it, at people being back together, relatively unimpeded by the pandemic and playing games together again. EGX felt much more like its old self. And many of us were there, walking the halls, hosting quizzes (thank you if you came to one), and playing games.
And what games there were: big ones, small ones, old ones, new ones. One of the most eye-catching instalments was a pool table with an enormously warped corner, curving up into the air, and which made playing it feel completely different to normal. Amazing what one simple change can do.

That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding is hard. Really damn hard. The journey to mastery is one counted in years - or even decades.


Landing a kickflip while moving along? Sure, today there are wildly more complex tricks out there, but it's still a tremendous achievement. It takes hours of investment and a deep resilience to failure to get there. But the moment you pop the board high, flick it with a foot just enough to spin once beneath you, and successfully commit to the landing, the reward is immense. It's not an achievement recompensed in any kind of currency like score. Rather, to succeed is more than enough of a payoff.


That is the mindset that has clearly founded the design of Session: Skate Sim. Certainly, it is not as hard as real skateboarding, but this is a game that is profoundly challenging, and one that makes you think like a skateboarder. The clue is in the name. Developer creā-ture Studios has strived to deliver a skateboarding simulator. In doing so, they've built something that does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of real skating; even if that approach sometimes comes at the expense of what makes for a consistently enjoyable video game. To deconstruct what that means, the conversation inevitably starts with an iconic series.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, 
here's our archive.
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a game as pretty as Horizon Forbidden West. The environments feel unreal in their beauty, while the details and textures on character models and clothing are incredible. All this stunning work does mean any imperfections are very distracting though - can someone please explain why Aloy’s hair is seemingly made of wool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. "He’s the person behind the worst of the twists," creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. "He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Were you fortunate enough to make it down to EGX London this year? It was this past weekend, and, if you ask me, there was a nice vibe around the place. It was nice to be back playing games together relatively unimpeded by the pandemic, and the show is feeling much more like its old self again. But what caught our eye there?


That's what I'm talking to my two Weekly guests Martin Robinson and Liv Ngan about today. What did Liv think of Wo Long, did Martin like Street Fighter 6, and why was everyone talking about new card game Wildfrost?


Elsewhere in today's show, I catch us up on some of the reviews we've missed while we've been away - sorry for the gap in our programming, but I've had some time off - before getting onto what will probably be the hot topic of the week: the FIFA 23 review. It's the final FIFA-branded game, and there's a lot to both like, and loathe, about it.
