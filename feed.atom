A thread on the game's subreddit community - complete with examples and screenshots - is claiming that "there’s a bug that reduces the XP earned on a significant portion of kills and XP globes". 

"We don’t fully understand why or when it will happen," explains u/staplepies (thanks, NME), who's one of five players "looking at this on and off for the last month or so".

Now that folks have arrived at their domicile, it's time to kick off the shoes, change into some sweats or yoga pants (even just skivvies - we don't judge!), grab some beer or wine, fire up the console or PC and gave a nice sit down to take their weekly frustrations out by playing a game or two.
That's what we're doing anyway, and here's what we're playing:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, it’s getting towards the middle of August, but that doesn’t mean the big summer of game announcements is over yet – last night (August 12) we saw THQ Nordic take to the airwaves to show off a selection of new games, including a brand new Alone in the Dark reboot.

Founded in 2011, THQ Nordic is an Austrian video game publisher and developer that has been snapping up the rights to game properties and IP across the world, as well as funding its own studios to create new series. Developers like Black Forest Games, Bugbear Entertainment, Gunfire Games, HandyGames, Piranha Bytes, Purple Lamp Studios, Rainbow Studios and many more besides fit under the THQ Nordic umbrella, working on internationally renowned series like Wreckfest, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Destory All Humans!
The publisher is known for not just sticking to one style, too – whether you’re into motorsport, action-adventure, RPGs, or whatever else, there’s likely something you’ll be interested in coming from THQ Nordic. The publisher said itself that it wanted to "land a massive punch" with this showcase – and with Wreckreation and Alone in the Dark, it seems that mission was accomplished.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' fourth DLC chapter, Shattering Spectreglass, is out now, "expanding the endgame experience" with a new class, better character creation options, a new boss, and "incredible loot".

Available for no extra cost for those who already own the season pass - and to buy separately for those who don't - Shattering Spectreglass ushers in the all-new Blightcaller class which "allows players to harness the noxious essence of swamps with potent precision, alongside new ways to customise your Fatemaker, including an all-new voice".

"Shattering Spectreglass begins in Dreamveil Overlook, where players will face Vesper’s most personal Mirror of Mystery yet," 2K explains. "Shattering Spectreglass offers a window into Vesper's memories, which are plagued by visions of Redmourne the Trivern, a mighty beast that can grow multiple heads and feeds on fear, siphoning his power from lost souls. Bringing down this winged behemoth once and for all is the only way to help Vesper escape her past."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The all-consuming IP hoover that is THQ Nordic has done a showcase! Mixing a nostalgia-baiting slate of 90s revivals with some intriguing newcomers, it was a surprisingly busy one too. So if you missed it and find yourself eager for updates on previously announced titles like Outcast 2, Jagged Alliance 3, and Gothic, plus some big new reveals - most notably the return of Alone in the Dark - read on.

Alone in the Dark


As rumoured, the grandaddy of survival horror is back in what THQ Nordic and developer Pieces Interactive is calling a "reimagining" of the 1992 original. It's being written and directed by Mikael Hedberg, who wrote the stunning Soma at Frictional Games, and is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at a later date. We've got a little more on this promising project elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK developer Three Fields Entertainment - the studio behind the likes of Dangerous Golf and Dangerous Driving - has unveiled Wreckreaction, a new custom-content-focused open-world racer coming to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox next year.


Three Fields - a studio founded by a small group of ex-Criterion developers - describes Wreckreaction as a game of high-speed racing, crashing, stunts, and exploration, all of which unfolds across a 400-square-mile map. That map is designed to represent an entire (fictitious) American state split into four areas, albeit one predominantly themed around woodland, grassland, and sandy beaches.


As to how players approach the challenges within Wreckreaction's world, the idea is that it's entirely up to them, with Three Fields saying it wants to encourage a more freeform style of fun as players explore the world in search of races, short cuts, and challenges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At today's THQ Nordic 2022 Digital Showcase, developer Pieces Interactive announced an Alone in the Dark reboot, due to release on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC. There's no release date yet, but in a behind-closed-doors preview event, we were told the game is currently in 'pre-alpha' – so don't expect it anytime soon (though it has been in development since 'late 2019').
THQ Nordic's executive producer Michael Paeck says that recent games (like the Resident Evil remakes, Silent Hill titles, and Dead Space) go for ‘terror’ more than 'horror', and the team wants this new title to go back to what made the original 1992 Alone in the Dark special. The team constantly referred to the dense, rich atmosphere of the first game, and how much it wants to recreate that in this new game – some 30 years after the original launched.
From a debut trailer we've seen so far, the game seems similar to the Resident Evil remakes Capcom has seen so much success with. It's a complete rethink of the first game, with the SOMA and Amnesia: Dark Descent writer, Mikael Hedberg, coming in to head up the narrative on the the project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mirage Game Studios - the developer behind well-received factory sim Little Big Workshop - has shared a first look at its adorable galactic property magnate game Space for Sale, which is due to launch on PC at a currently undisclosed date.


Space for Sale casts players in the role of a cute astronaut that's just bought an entire galaxy on the cheap, with the aim of turning it into a dream destination for alien homeseekers across the cosmos. To reach that goal, players must scour the galaxy's procedural planets in search of the perfect spot to fulfil their clients' sometimes eccentric needs.


Although Space for Sale's basic concept sounds very management sim, Mirage says the game's sandbox-style gameplay is more of a "hands-on experience" than that might suggest, with players needing to explore each planet in person as they hunt down the ideal location to drop a plot, construct buildings, collect resources, scan items, and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THQ Nordic is 'reimagining' survival horror classic Alone in the Dark, with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm.


Alone in the Dark, for those too young to remember, is widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, with the 1992 original pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.


THQ Nordic's reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle's suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and shakes it up a little for modern audiences.

In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase 'colony sim' to its literal extreme, didn't they? Are we sure that isn't Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I'm saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn't... astronommical. Sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale: Requiem for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No-one is playing Netflix’s games. Well, no, that’s not true – 1% of Netflix subscribers are. But that means that over 200 million people have access to, say, one of the best strategy games out there… and probably don’t even know about it.
For the more casual players, interested in less intensive and more cosy affairs, there’s the likes of Poinpy, Krispee Street, and Knittens. If you’re a nut for Stranger Things and have been humming Running Up That Hill and Master of Puppets since the one-two punch of those musical finales, you’ll probably find the likes of Stranger Things 3: The Game and Stranger Things: 1984 both worth your time.

But the odds are you don’t even know these games are available as part of your subscription fee. Until I started writing this piece, I didn’t even know how difficult it was to access the games on various platforms – Netflix hasn’t exactly been communicative about promoting them to its still-humongus user base, has it? To make matters more complicated, you can’t play the games via the app, but instead you need to head to the mobile store of your platform of choice (iOS or Android) and download the games from there. Anything viable with your Netflix subscription will be indicated with that trademark red N logo , and listed via a dedicated in-app tab on the homescreen. Clicking that – or finding a relevant game in your storefront of choice – will prompt a Netflix log-in, and from there you can play the game. For free.

It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

No, Kojima is not sharing any teasers from his upcoming horror project with Xbox. He simply shared the P.T. artwork again.
Again, no, there's no new P.T. announcements. It isn't coming back from the dead. In fact, it still isn't even downloadable anywhere unless you're tracking it – or its clones - down by nefarious means.
Kojima tweeted that "It's been 8 years", and, well, he isn't wrong. It's been eight years since what could've been the best Silent Hill game – a complete revival for the Konami series from Metal Gear Solid's best – was robbed from us. Fortunately for me, who will not stop rambling on about P.T. and the loss of Silent Hills for the life of me, I've been reminded that I'm not alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you didn't see the sneaky League of Legends leaks that slipped out yesterday, you may be surprised to hear that the jungle role is set to undergo some major changes during the 2023 Pre-season. This includes aids for jungle pathing, jungle camp leashing, and jungle pets which appear to be the answer to stale itemisation in the role.
According to the official release for this update, jungle was a role that was actively avoided by a significant number of players. While the goal apparently isn’t to dumb down the role, some areas of difficulty are being reworked to remove this barrier of entry and allow for greater skill expression in other areas.
Let start with the pets - by a large margin the most brow-raising addition to the role. While the folks at Riot Games aren’t giving up details on how exactly these will work, we know they’re an answer to the bland blue smite / red smite itemisation. This is being added to make the process of killing jungle camps a bit more exciting - rather than make it a practice of dull minion farming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Nixxes patched Marvel's Spider-Man a couple of hours before embargo on Wednesday, setting back our PC tech review, but the update was worth it and while a little more polish is required to get the game fully into shape, the release you'll be playing today definitely hits the spot. We've already covered the PC version in broad brush strokes, but today we can get a little more granular and offer up our optimised settings for delivering the best balance between performance and fidelity. 
Let's quickly recap on what we've already discussed - and it's mostly great stuff. First of all, I like the graphics configuration menu that appears before you run the game - it's a Nixxes (and IO Interactive!) hallmark that gives you an instant 'at a glance' look at the options available and allows for friction-free settings changes outside of the game. Those settings include fully realised support for practically any aspect ratio, plus configurable field of view. Not only that, but the game's full-screen support includes actual exclusive full-screen, allowing for resolutions and refresh rates outside of the desktop options - a rare thing in PC gaming today. 
Also impressive is how the in-game options menu actually works. Pause the game at any time and any tweaks you make are instantly deployed, allowing you to see the changes you've made in real-time. In a world where some problematic PC titles don't do this and can even require you to restart the game, this is excellent. On paper, all of the things I've praised here should be standard and second nature to PC developers but unfortunately that's not the case. Where Nixxes excels is where ports like Elden Ring, Final Fantasy VII or Halo Infinite flounder, sometimes spectacularly so.

have some work to do on Windows. In order to do so, I have had a Windows
10 VM in my libvirt configuration that I can use.
A while ago, Microsoft issued Windows 11. I recently found out that all
the components for running Windows 11 inside a libvirt VM are available,
and so I set out to upgrade my VM from Windows 10 to Windows 11. This
wasn't as easy as I thought, so here's a bit of a writeup of all the
things I ran against, and how I fixed them.
Windows 11 has a number of hardware requirements that aren't necessary
for Windows 10. There are a number of them, but the most important three
are:
Secure Boot is required (Windows 10 would still boot on a machine
without Secure Boot, although buying hardware without at least…]]></summary>

The mod, uploaded earlier this week, replaces usual protagonist Kiryu Kazuma with Halo's poster boy Master Chief. Specifically his incarnation in Halo 3.


Kashiiera is primarily a Halo modder as it's their favourite franchise, but they also love Yakuza and so worked hard to project Master Chief's model correctly onto Kiryu's to keep him looking as natural as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, we heard about the next batch of games coming to bulk out the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers on Sony’s newly dressed-up subscription service. At first glance, it’s not a bad offering – for owners of PS Plus Extra, you'll be able to pick up three different Yakuza titles (including the best one, Yakuza 0) – but beyond that, there are some glaring issues with this month’s rollout.

Sure, these three triple-A RPG games are a fantastic entry point for anyone jostling to get into the series for the first time. You can even come in at the ground floor, play Yakuza 0, and get to know gangland heartthrob Kazuma Kiryu and his stomping grounds of Kabukichō. For the sake of the headline at the top of this piece, this is Good.
Being able to play the first three full chapters of the Yakuza series (with the promise of the rest of the saga to come to PS Plus later) is objectively Good. There is nothing Bad, or indeed Ugly, about that. It’s moves like this that keep PS Plus a viable rival to Xbox Game Pass, and halt critics of the service calling it ‘a disaster’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me keep this brief, as I have a wash on - a wash full of briefs! Arcade Paradise is a game about running a laundrette - at first it is anyway. It's one of those jobs a lot of us start out in even if you don't, as is the case here, have a family in the laundrette biz. You run the laundrette, day by day, bussing in and out. You collect trash, you wash and fold clothes, you unclog the toilet and empty the coin hopper in the tokens machine. You put the laundrette's income in the safe and you chat to your friends on a messenger app accessed via the 56k set-up in the back office.


But in another back room there are arcade games - cabinets with playable games! It's like opening a door and finding that aliens have landed. You can play these games - play clever spins on match-three, on Mr Driller, on plenty of others - but you can also earn money from them too. You can collect the money in their coin hoppers and whack that in the safe. And what if all this money you're collecting, what if you used it to expand? To buy new cabinets, to create more room to store them in? Onwards.


So Arcade Paradise moves on, in step with the rolling Katamari of commerce and capitalism. More, brighter, shinier. But also quicker, more efficient. More free time in the day is opened up by the right upgrades, so that the time, along with the money, can be reinvested.

In its weekly blog post, or TWAB, the company explained some of the weapon balance changes players can expect, which includes buffing some of the game's under-utilised weapon archetypes.


For example, lightweight bows will get faster draw times as well as an increased "perfect draw" window to make things a bit easier for players.

Today on Weekly, news reporter Ed Nightingale talks about running a university of his own in Two-Point Campus, which he really liked. And we hear from Christian Donlan about a game I've been really looking forward to, Cult of the Lamb. Spoiler: it's good.
But Christian is more excited about the game he's reviewing now - a game called Arcade Paradise. It's a game about running a laundrette but also an arcade within it, which, with time and careful management, will grow into the main attraction.

Bungie was allowed more time to reinstate its case and a few weeks later alleged that AimJunkies had reverse-engineered and copied the software code for Destiny 2.

        <updated>2022-08-12T11:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I have been in one of those periods where no video game will do, where I have chased a game - a something - across download libraries and subscription catalogues and a couple of cupboard drawers in vain, a quest across gaming's ribcage and shoulder blades for some roaming, ineffable itch that I cannot scratch. I suspect I'm not alone in this one, though, so if you ever find yourself in the same spot, may I suggest: the mop-up.


The mop-up has many forms. For me, somewhat uncreatively, it's the task of completing a "living 'dex" in Pokémon - catching one of every Pokémon ever released and storing them all, in order, in one place, including all the many different forms and stages of each evolution. This makes it a bit more long-winded than completing a regular regional or national Pokédex, because you couldn't just catch, say, one Abra and then evolve it into Kadabra, then Alakazam, crossing off all three at once - you need one of each in your possession simultaneously. 


The challenge is really besides the point, though. A good mop-up, I reckon, will always have a few common elements. One is that it happens, by definition, at the end of a game you've broadly completed - think finishing sidequests, bumping off the last surviving enemies on a given list, wiping the final factions off a map, et cetera.

The game is being developed by Square Enix London Mobile in partnership with Navigator Games, and is described as a "free-to-play, RPG adventure".


At release, the game will follow the main gang (Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa and Momo) across the storyline of the series. New stories are promised too, as well as "fan-favourite locations, stories, and events in an open world". Subsequent updates will feature other minor characters from The Last Airbender such as Avatar Kyoshi, as well as characters and storylines from Avatar: The Legend of Korra.

So, Nintendo have given keen fans like me exactly what they want in the form of Kirby's Dream Buffet, which has finally had its release date revealed.
In a tweet from Nintendo of America, a three-minute gameplay trailer for the title has been shown off, and the release date has been announced for 17 August, 2022. That's just next week!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WashBear Studio's charming, thoroughly enjoyable dinosaur park management sim Parkasaurus is looking to wow guests with a whole new, decidedly more acquatic, selection of exhibits from today, 11th August, with the arrival of its new Sea Monsters DLC on PC.


Building on Parkasaurus' core management action - which takes obvious inspiration from the likes of Theme Park and DinoPark Tycoon - the new Sea Monsters DLC introduces 11 aquatic reptiles and fish, as well as corresponding flooded enclosures, for players to install on their quest to create the ultimate dino-flavoured tourist attraction.


If you're looking for specifics, those new dinos are Elasmosaurus, Plesiosaurus, Mosasaurus, Atopodentatus, Sarcosuchus, Archelon, Dunkleosteus, Liopleurodon, Ichthyosaurus, Placodus, and Megalodon. But Sea Monsters also introduces three new campaign missions, three new biomes, and 20+ exhibit items and hats - all of which will cost £5.19/$6.99 USD on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If plain old football doesn't quite do it for you, but your interest is piqued when I say football but melded to a silly, sprawling action-RPG, then allow me to introduce you to Soccer Story from publisher No More Robots and Not Tonight developer PanicBarn, coming to Steam, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Game Pass "soon".


Soccer Story (which, despite the name and similar premise, is unrelated to developer Sidebar Games' magnificent Golf Story) is a single-player "physics-based" adventure in which players must quest, puzzle, and sport their way to restoring football - and, thus, peace and harmony - in a world where it's been banned.


Soccer Story promises an adventure packed with "quirky characters, quests, rogue refs, and wack soccer-adjacent sports", where every problem - from solving puzzles to finding secrets - can be overcome with the help of your magic football.

Announced last June, Metal Slug Tactics reunites familiar faces Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma as they lead the Peregrine Falcon Squad onto a different kind of battlefield, where the series' classic side-scrolling action makes way for "dynamic, strategic combat" on a grid-based map.


Skill trees, perks, and a "super attack-fueling" adrenaline system have all been been promised upon Metal Slug Tactics' arrival, which was originally expected to occur at some point this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflexion Games, the studio founded by former BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn, has announced a delay for its Victorian fantasy adventure Nightingale, with the game now expected to enter early access some time next year.


Nightingale, described as a "shared world survival crafting game", was initially announced a few years back, but got its first proper unveiling at last year's The Game Awards. Its reveal was accompanied by an eye-catching trailer in which well-dressed ladies and gents travelled through portals to strange new worlds, full of wonderfully unsettling eldritch creatures.


Inflexion was initially aiming to launch Nightingale into early access at some point this year, but the developer has now revised that plan, pushing the game's early access release back into the "first half of 2023".

Anyway, you can get ten years' worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that's a nice little savings - and of course it's far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the ongoing fallout from Microsoft and Sony's squabbling over Activision Blizzard and it's blockbuster franchise Call of Duty.


If you've been living under a rock for the last six months, this all stems from Microsoft's intent to buy Activision for 68.7bn, which Sony isn't too happy about. Recently we've heard arguments from Sony offering some of its views on the deal - that it would be bad news for PlayStation, essentially - and now Microsoft itself has hit back. 

Microsoft has reiterated that it does not want to make Call of Duty an Xbox exclusive - for now, at least - and even said it would be an unprofitable move if it did so. Even more remarkably, it has also hit out at Sony for suggesting the Microsoft-Activision deal would stifle competition - and claimed PlayStation itself pays out money to block games coming to Xbox Game Pass.

These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise.

In a statement issued to Eurogamer, EA echoed many of its recent comments on Ultimate Team's card packs, which have come under fire from children's groups and researchers in recent years for their links to gambling, and from players for enabling pay-to-win in competitive modes.


"We wholeheartedly believe that Ultimate Team and FUT Packs, which have been part of the game for more than a decade, are a part of FIFA that players love - fans love that the game reflects the real-world excitement and strategy of building and managing a squad. Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair," EA's statement reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players can expect plenty of hip-hop in the Street Fighter 6 soundtrack as the game modernises the series, while honouring the past.


In an interview with Spin, producer Shuhei Matsumoto and lead composer Yoshiya Terayama discussed the musical influences on the next game.


"Street Fighter 6 is very respectful of past works, such as the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2. We are taking on new challenges while honouring that foundation. Also, you can definitely expect hip hop. We put a lot of effort into how it sounds," said Matsumoto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has been hit by a fresh worker complaint in the US, which a report suggests is due to the company's response to labour activism. 


Both Nintendo of America and Aston Carter, a company Nintendo uses to recruit workers, have been referred to the National Labor Relations Board over the matter, which alleges that a worker suffered over the company's "coercive rules".


The complaint was first reported by Axios, which stated that allegations of this nature typically relate to cases where a worker claims a company has interfered with their right to unionise or discuss working conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jordan Challenge is coming with NBA 2K23, making its long awaited return after 12 years away from the franchise. In this mode you’ll be able to take on 15 unique experiences, each set in one of Michael Jordan’s milestone moments in their career.
Alongside each of the challenges, you’ll be able to watch a video interview with a luminary integral to each real life moment, including – but not limited to – 1998 opponent Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Denis Rodman, and head coach Phil Jackson.
One of the coolest aspects of the Jordan Challenge is the attention to year-specific detail. The games have filters that reflect the recording / T.V quality of the time, and you can see era-specific jerseys, courts, and even sponsors during each mission. As such, it’s about as close to an authentic retelling of Michael Jordan’s career as you could hope for.

Posted on Reddit by user PurpleToaster20, over 400 images of documentation, early builds, and storyboards are available to view. This fairly comprehensive overview of what got scrapped is open for anyone and everyone to read.
In addition, a full on video will be posted August 18 going through these assets and the info, set to run for roughly 30 minutes. According to the leaker, this vast collection of information was gathered from a variety of sources.
To break down some of the juicy details put out in the open, we know from these leaks that the scrapped 2017 campaign mode was intended to be a 2v2 affair. Titled 'career', you and a partner would race to the finish of a 15-20 minute mission, taking on AI enemies that block your path along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, Lego turns 90 years old – an incredible milestone for a little toy company that, at several points in its life, was on the verge of going under. It’s more impressive still that Lego reaches this milestone while one of the biggest toy brands on the planet, recognizable to children everywhere, and all achieved while remaining a private company.

Lego has always had an interesting relationship with video games. On one hand, the company naturally sees video games as competition: when Lego’s financial results declined for the first time in 13 years (half a decade ago), one market factor the company pointed the finger at was kids playing more video games. At the same time, however, gaming has become an inexctricable part of Lego’s business. 
We now get a high-quality Lego-based video game at least every couple of years – and quite often more frequently than that. These are usually based on Lego’s licensed properties – so gaming adventures that retell the stories of comic book, or Star Wars, or Harry Potter and its kin – just with the tale spun in a blocky, comedic form. A lot is owed to the Lego games as designed by British developer Traveler’s Tales, in fact: much of the presentation of the hugely successful Lego movies has its genesis in these gaming experiences.

You end up loving the game and he likes what you're about, so he grants you exclusive rights to introduce Dungeons & Dragons to the UK, and to Europe, and to sell it there for three years. You can only afford six copies but it doesn't matter: you'll soon be able to afford a lot more. 
That's not even the best story my guests have! They've done so much and created so much. That games business they were running? It was only Games Workshop, wasn't it - a business that would change the face of tabletop gaming. But, not content with running only that, this pair would work well into their nights to create a series of game books called Fighting Fantasy, making themselves best-selling authors in the process. The series has sold more than 20 million copies today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox "simply wouldn't be profitable", Microsoft has said.


The claim comes as part of a fresh war of words between Xbox and PlayStation, as Microsoft seeks to finalise its eye-opening $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.


Specifically, it comes in response to Sony's recent objections to the deal - in which it argued that Call of Duty could not be rivalled, and that the franchise was vitally important to PlayStation as it influenced players' choice of console.

To get access to the demo, you will need to have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. However, not everyone who has a Switch necessarily wants to subscribe to NSO. 
To negate this, Nintendo is offering everyone who downloads the demo a code that will give them a seven day trial of its subscription service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When PowerWash Simulator came out of Early Access, it became quite a hit  amongst the team here at Eurogamer. I was curious to see whether I'd enjoy it too, so I cashed in the free month of Game Pass that came with my new PC to give it a try.


I enjoy it a lot. In the game's career mode, there is no pressure to finish a level quickly or efficiently and that's what I love about it. You can ignore the time and leave the hose running for as long as it takes you, and that's all part of the appeal. Bertie expertly summed it up in his review.: "This is not a game about rushing towards an end," he wrote. "This is a game about the sedate pleasures of repetitive work - a slower game about the satisfaction of a job well done. It's relaxing and calming, and that's a powerful quality." 


But this inevitably got me wondering about the other end of the gameplay spectrum in PowerWash Simulator. Speed and efficiency, rather than leisure. True, you can already play the game's time-limited and water-limited modes, but they weren't as extreme as what I was imagining. I'm talking speedwashing. Was there anyone out there playing like that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a lengthy document submitted to the Brazilian government as part of its investigation into Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has claimed Sony pays developers "blocking rights" to prevent games from appearing on Xbox Game Pass.


The accusation appears in a 27-page rebuttal of Sony's recent objections to Microsoft's Activision Blizzard buyout, made to Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) as part of its investigation. Much of Sony's argument had focused on Call of Duty - which it claimed had "no rival" and was "so popular that it influences users' choice of console" - with the PlayStation maker suggesting, among other things, that the inclusion of Call of Duty on Microsoft's Game Pass service would hamper its ability to compete.


Microsoft's response is as wide-ranging as Sony's initial objections, touching on everything from the fact it has previously managed to grow Game Pass without Activision Blizzard's titles - suggesting Call of Duty mightn't be quite as "essential" as Sony claims - to a reiteration of its assurances that it won't be making Call of Duty an Xbox console exclusive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it's not a stunner as far as looks go, and it's not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it's far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it's been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd.

In some senses, it is and was very ironic, when she became ill about last year, I had promised myself I would be by her side for 5-6 years, not go anywhere either Hillhacks or Debconf or any meetup and I was ok with that. Now that she’s no more I have no clue why am I living. What is the purpose, the utility? When she was alive, the utility was understandable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Betrayal At Club Low - the latest jazz-infused odyssey from The Norwood Suite developer Cosmo D - finally has a release date, and will be swinging open its murderous doors for some woozily surreal adventure on 9th September.


Folding into the broader narrative of Cosmo D's interconnected Off-Peak City games (so far consisting of 2015's Off-Peak, 2017's The Norwood Suite, and its 2020 follow-up Tales from Off-Peak City Vol. 1), Betrayal At Club Low sees players going undercover to attempt a rescue mission of sorts by infiltrating a "deceptively dangerous" nightclub/former coffin factory/"haven for wild-limbed dancing, mind-altering music and shady characters".


While previous games in the series were largely focussed on relaxed roaming and light puzzling as players soaked up their deliciously off-kilter sensibilities, Betrayal at Club Low does things a little differently, drawing inspiration from "short, punchy, independent zine RPGs" in order to evoke the feel of a one-off tabletop session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The embargo for the highly anticipated Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lifted today and you may be wondering where the Digital Foundry coverage is - we received the game a while back along with most other outlets. Well, the truth is that developer Nixxes is still hard at work with the game, patches are still incoming (the latest arriving a few hours ago) and we're intent on delivering coverage that accurately reflects the state of the game you'll be playing on day oneas best as we can manage. Right now, the port is looking exceptionally impressive in many regards but to briefly sum up, it plays brilliant on higher-end PCs, it also works very nicely on Steam Deck, but we've experienced some problems with low to mid-range GPUs. In fact, the very latest update to the game seeks to address those very issues - with some success.


Taking a more global look at the conversion though, there's much to commend Nixxes' efforts. The game supports all aspects ratios we could test, from the 16:9 of most modern screens to the 21:9 and 32:9 ultra-wide variants, the 16:10 of Steam Deck and even 4:3 for those interested in an old-school CRT experience. On top of this, there's adjustable field of view support too.
Per other Nixxes titles, there's also fullscreen and exclusive fullscreen support - and it is properly implemented with resolutions and refresh rates independent of what the desktop is configured to. It sounds mundane, but these things matter. Of course, unlocked frame-rates are supported, but for those with less capable PCs, the half refresh rate v-sync mode actually works properly with consistent frame-pacing (not on Steam Deck though - use the system level option for that) while dynamic resolution scaling is also implemented, with a configurable frame-rate target. Targeting a locked, consistent 30fps or 60fps experience is made that much easier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fan-made Half-Life 2 VR mod nearly eight years in the making will finally be getting a public release next month in the form of an open beta.


Eurogamer first reported on the Source VR Mod Team's Half-Life 2: VR mod in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra back in 2013. Some time after the new version's announcement, the project appeared to stall - it entered "its own kind of development hell and was all but abandoned", according to the team's website - but it re-emerged in 2021 and is slowly approaching the finish line.


Half-Life 2: VR - one of several attempts to bring Valve's seminal shooter sequel to virtual reality headsets - promises a range of features, including room scale VR, the ability to manipulate items and weapons directly with your hands, full locomotion, a weapon selection menu inspired by Valve's Half-Life: Alyx, and tweaked vehicle rides intended to help reduce motion sickness.

Last night, fans spotted games such as Soul Hackers 2, GTA5 and Elden Ring were listed with an option to play via cloud streaming. Some speculated this was being rolled out now, in advance of a Gamescom announcement later this month.


But Microsoft has now said that the games' listings - which also flagged them as being part of Xbox Game Pass - were bugged, and that the issue has now been fixed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The MultiVersus hype is still strong, moving on from its rapturous release a few weeks ago. The game has a lot to offer for fans of the ridiculous collection of IP under the Warner Bros umbrella, and with news of more characters on the horizon, it looks like they’ll have more to look forward to. Even then, for a significant portion of the playerbase, the game is ripe for more. These creatives, artists, and memsters make up the MultiVersus Modding community.
However, the future of this community and all the momentum it gained due to a mix of the popularity of the platform fighter and the appeal of what they were creating is uncertain. This comes thanks to a rise in copyright strikes on published video content featuring mods, the main avenue creatives use to show off their modded works. 

One such modder, who goes by JtheDuelist online, began creating mods around four years ago, where they created skins for Monster Hunter World, afterwards moving onto Guilty Gear: Strive and Final Fantasy 14 after cutting their teeth. They first got into MultiVersus after receiving a code for the alpha test prior to launch, and began their modding projects for the title after coming across others on modding website Gamebanana.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A brand new trailer for Forspoken was released today, bringing alongside it a wave of cringe via the protagonists’ description of the wacky situation they’ve found themselves in. In fact, this bad boy can fit so much cringe in it, that the internet has gathered round and have begun the age-old practice of memeing it to death, creating their own snarky takes on the video across social media.
Mock-narration for God of War, Yakuza, Doom, and Devil May Cry have all been thrown into the ring. Our favourite though has to be a full on trailer made for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2. Which was posted online by Twitter user Bobvids. It’s an absolute must-watch! The original trailer, you can watch for yourselves below. Brace yourselves.
So you may be wondering, what’s the deal with Forspoken anyway? Originally planned for a October 11 release date, Square Enix announced the title would be pushed back to early next year on January 24. That means you’ve still got some time to kill before you see freaking dragons and talk to your cuffs, we’re afraid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technological constraints meant that the original Monkey Island game saw 25 percent of its dialogue text cut before it was released.


Talking to Sony Santa Monica's Alanah Pearce, writer Tim Schafer revealed that The Secret of Monkey Island was originally too long and had to get some heavy editing. 


"We were writing on Monkey Island, and we were told 'you guys, we can't go on six floppies. We have to go on five. We have too much text,'" Schafer recalled before remarking how strange that sort of thing is to imagine now.

It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, the best moments of a city-building game are always the beginnings, when there's nothing but potential ahead of you. Things are manageable, the world is unspoiled, the pace is slow. To me, that's idyllic. And if ever a game understood that, it's Farthest Frontier.
It's a game about a group of working class people fed up with being shat on by the rich, in the big city where they live, so they strike out for the literal farthest frontier to make it on their own. It's that fantasy. The era is the birth of the Industrial Revolution, maybe - it's not explicitly clear. And that's how it begins: a dozen people and a caravan and an endless wilderness around them to tame.
What I love about what comes next is how unhurriedly it happens, and how small-scale it continues to be. Farthest Frontier is not about going from dozens to thousands, from village to sprawling metropolis, and that zooming out you then feel as the person in charge. It's about staying small and staying close to the people you're caring for. It's probably wrong to call it a city-builder at all but rather a town-builder, because even many hours in, from what I've read, settlements are still only a few hundred people big (apparently the game struggles performance-wise past that, but it is Early Access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a bit of an up-and-down year to be a Sonic fan. Sonic Frontiers has looked brilliant and troubled in alternating media drops, and Sonic Origins offered fans the definitive versions of the 2D classics they’ve been clamoring for – except they were riddled with bugs, and weren’t really definitive. But now, Sonic fans have another reason to celebrate: the release of Sonic Triple Trouble… but in a new format.

For those of you who aren’t a thousand years old, Triple Trouble is a classic 8-bit Sonic game. Because the 8-bit games came out at roughly the same time as the 16-bit games, they’re rightly not as revered or beloved – but they are still, broadly, lovely little platformers that attempt to adapt the Sonic formula for much weaker platforms. A few of these games were loose adaptations of their Mega Drive equivalents – but a few were all-original affairs.

Most notable of these is Sonic the Hedgehog: Triple Trouble. This 8-but title is actually older than Sonic’s other classic 2D adventures, releasing for the Sega Game Gear handheld a few months after Sonic & Knuckles hit Mega Drive. That placement in the Sonic timeline got some fans thinking: what if this game had been 16-bit, and what if it were a sequel to Sonic 3 & Knuckles? What if it were, essentially, Sonic 4?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splatoon 3 just got a serious deep dive thanks to this afternoon's Nintendo Direct, revealing new levels, new weapons and an all-new approach to Splatfests that will introduce three-way fights into the series for the first time. 


Three-way fights come as part of the returning Splatfests, with matches during the special timed events being split into two halves, with the first part a traditional 4v4 face-off while the second sees a 4v2v2 fight for territory. 


There'll be a chance to sample this particular new flavour of Splatoon during a Splatfest World Premiere that's taking place on 27th August - effectively a free demo where players can sample Splatoon 3 for a limited period, choosing to fight for rock, paper or scissors (it's worth noting that the demo will be playable from 25th August , giving a small window for practice before the Splatfest World Premiere itself).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iron Galaxy is a developer with a lot of merit, in my book. Responsible for nearly 15 years of great contract work, the studio is also known for producing its own projects every now and again, all of which bears marks of its own brand of action. You may know them for the latter seasons of Killer Instinct, Divekick, and now Rumbleverse.
A venture into the battle royale genre – albeit with guns and firefights traded out for a vastly different gunshow packed with big muscles and wrestling – this is the first big in-house IP release from the studio for some time. To find out the origins of this game, as well as how the team at Iron Galaxy plans to differentiate its game in a saturated market, and its overall hopes for the title, I sat down and talked to co-CEO Chelsea Blasko about everything Rumbleverse.
It’s been widely reported that Blasko was the source of the original wrestling battle royale idea, stemming from their desire to recreate the fun of classic wrestling and the high-flying stars of the Macho Man era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm a cult leader these days. Let me tell you what I've just been doing.


I woke early and cooked some food that gave everyone diarrhea. Then I gave a quick sermon to cheer everyone up. I planted some seeds so I could make some more food that gives everyone diarrhea, disappeared for a bit to play a dice game, donated some mushrooms to an old pal in the woods, and caught up on my fishing before heading over to the Gold Guy. I bought some Tarot cards that were going cheap, one of which promises a lovely health boost whenever it gets dealt. I went on a mission and murdered a lot of nasty things in the woods, harvesting resources and whatnot as I went. I killed a boss, working my way up through a sort of watery forest to the next mega boss. Back to the camp after that to clean up all that diarrhea, build a few beds because my followers are sulking, water and fertilise some seeds, knock up a scarecrow so birds don't eat my seeds, make myself a nice new fleece with lovely perks and then catch the rising sun and do it all over again. I'm tempted, you know, to take up smelting.


Cult of the Lamb is a management game and an action roguelite in which you play an evil sheep. It's astonishingly systems-heavy. You can build dozens of structures to look after your flock, and your flock can grumble and sicken and die and preach behind your back in dozens of ways. You're always after new cult members, each with their own quirks, and you're always after the resources to keep everyone happy, because happy cultists in turn give you the resources to make them even happier - and grow more powerful when you set out on action roguelite runs, working your way through minor bosses to middle-management bosses and then hopefully whoever's at the top.

As a reminder, Microsoft is one of the few companies committed to Gamescom this year - and the only platform holder. Both Sony and Nintendo are sitting out the show's big in-person return, alongside Activision Blizzard and Take-Two. 

Ubisoft, Bandai Namco and Embracer are among those also in attendance, though Assassin's Creed fans are expecting all of Ubisoft's big reveals to actually take place online, via a special event due in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

Due to take place on Saturday 27th August, this full-day event will cap off the game's introduction of Ultra Beasts and (hopefully) see its hunky Professor Willow return after being left dramatically MIA.


The event has plenty for those playing free, or extras for those with a ticket. These premium bits are also included as part of the earlier Global Go Fest weekend back in June - so if you played that, you're covered.

In a blog post on the event, Blizzard noted that its loot boxes have a chance to contain rare items from previous Anniversary and seasonal events, and told fans not to "wait too long to snag those skins you've been eyeing for the past year".

Well, that’s exactly what’s happening this week, as Sonic the Hedgehog and friends speed into the world of Fall Guys for a limited-time event.
The event will begin on August 11 and run up until August 15, 2022, in celebration of over thirty years of Sonic the Hedgehog, his friends, and even his enemies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common error when using the sssd daemon to authenticate via Active Directory on Linux seems to be:
sssd[$PID]: ; TSIG error with server: tsig verify failure
This is from sssd launching the command “nsupdate -g” to do dynamic DNS updates. It is possible to specify the DNS server in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf but that will only be used AFTER the default servers have been attempted, so it seems impossible to stop this error from happening. It doesn’t appear to do any harm as the correct server is discovered and used eventually. The commands piped to the nsupdate command will be something like:
server $SERVERIP
realm $DOMAIN
update delete $HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN. in A
update add $HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN. 3600 in A $HOSTIP
send
update delete $HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN. in AAAA
send

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not uncommon for those who would consider themselves ex-Minecraft players to feel the game’s siren call float to the back of their mind every once in a while, launching that nostalgia-driven urge to start over in a new world. Whether it’s returning to survival mode to aimlessly punch trees, or finally committing to recreating Hobbiton using creative mode and a rich suite of mods, there’s no denying that Minecraft has an enduring appeal and a malleable blend of freedom and structure that will keep people coming back to it indefinitely. 
I’m no stranger to the allure of Minecraft, but recently I’ve found myself drawn back to its peculiar, spiky-haired cousin: Dragon Quest Builders 2, which just might be the best thing that Minecraft has ever inspired. It's a game that serves as proof that there is still rich, untapped potential in mixing Minecraft’s best qualities with other genres' and aesthetics. 
Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a prime example of where such ambition can take us: an undeniably charming game that shows both reverence to the franchise it’s based on and the art of creativity within games itself. Across the game’s lengthy single player story and beyond, Builders 2 frequently acknowledges the kind of player that it attracts, encouraging you to ignore the boundaries of its intricate community-building simulator in favor of building whatever the hell you’d like on your own terms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many League of Legends fans will already know, Udyr is getting a massive rework to both his visuals and his in-game abilities. A beloved character in the hearts of the community, including early adopters of the super-popular MOBA and competitive players alike, this massive undertaking came at the request of a community poll earlier in the year.
As such, we’ve broken down every change coming to Udyr with insights from the development team responsible sprinkled throughout. With hopes of preserving his original style, modernising his look, and converging his lore to recent events, has the team reformed Udyr for the better? Let's find out!
The new Udyr is a Juggernaut, intended primarily for jungle, but top is an alternative kept in mind with this rework. While he has a collection of revamped abilities to use in game, he’ll still be charging headfirst into fights and switching stances to apply different effects. In this way, he’ll feel very familiar to pre-existing Udyr players on live servers right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever had the insatiable urge to run your own college campus full of scientists, clowns, or even medieval knights, Two Point Campus finally grants you the ability. In typical management simulation fashion, you are the omnipotent being reining over various campuses and determining the fate of hundreds of students. 
While this may seem like a lot of pressure – keeping everyone happy and students’ grades high – Two Point Campus strikes a perfect balance; it’s easy to pick up and play, while incredibly difficult to master. Anyone familiar with the predecessor, Two Point Hospital, will know that the lucrative three-star rating is hard to come by, but it’s so rewarding when you do finally reach that milestone.
In his preview, assistant editor Alex Donaldson argued that Two Point Hospital is a worthy successor to an all-time great; the all-time great being Theme Hospital. While I’d love to agree, I never played Bullfrog’s classic. In fact, I don’t like hospitals much at all, and even Two Point Hospital – despite all of its charm – felt incredibly lost on me. However, Two Point Campus has now strutted along and opened its doors, and I’ve finally been able to appreciate these games for what they’re worth.

While the video doesn't go into any more details, such as how Lugo happens to have this mythical controller in their possession, it does all seem to be genuine. It even has the controller's soft shell case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As if the news of Sonic getting a third movie wasn’t enough, it appears that Pac-Man will also be in receipt of its very own live-action movie.
Pac-Man is a video game series first conceived in 1980 by Namco, that went on to become somewhat of a social phenomenon. As a result, Pac-Man isn’t a complete stranger to the world of television and cinema, having already been privy to two series from ABC and Disney XD respectively.
First reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a new Pac-Man project is in the works with Bandai Namco Entertainment and Wayfarer Studios on board. The movie itself is reported to be based on Chuck Williams’ (of Lightbeam Entertainment) original idea, who was also an associate producer on 2020’s Sonic the Hedgehog.

Chamber was first introduced to Valorant back in November 2021, and the Sentinel Agent certainly went down a treat. With a pistol and a sniper built into his kit of abilities, Chamber has perhaps been one of the most offensive defense specialists in the roster. So, understandably, he quickly became a top pick amongst ranked players.
However, Valorant has noticed that its players have managed to master Chamber quite efficiently by now. So much so, that his strengths are overshadowing his weaknesses, and counter-playing his kit isn’t as effective as the developer once hoped.

You will also see your monster companions getting excited, and little speech bubbles will appear above their heads when they know you are in the vicinity of some goodies.

Enter Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two. Known for making quite incendiary comments – like telling us we're all ready to pay for $70 games, saying backwards compatibility doesn't matter, and so on – the anti-union CEO made some on-brand comments during last night's earnings presentation.

The world of new Square Enix strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is a bit like that, but for English history. 


You’ve got medieval knights collecting their kit from 17th century plague doctors, before going out to fight stovepipe-hatted cockneys straight out of the Victorian workhouse at the behest of tweed-jacketed gentlemen. Then some skeletons turn up with a couple of trolls in suits of armour. It goes places.

You probably already guessed a delay was on the cards, considering public tests have yet to begin for the game, not to mention the fact Embark has been quiet on the news and gameplay footage front.
Well, the developer made it official today. In a Twitter announcement, Embark said ARC Raiders has been delayed to 2023. The extra time will be used to "expand the experience." Seeing as there's plenty we still don't know about the game, Embark added that more details will arrive once tests with players begin - though it's not clear when that's going to be.

The controversy didn't end there, with many also unhappy about the delisting of the fan-made ScummVM version of the original game on GOG. The ScummVM version, seen as vastly superior to Nightdive's remaster, was subsequently reinstated a week later, and was also then packaged with the Enhanced Edition on Steam. 


Now, Nightdive Studio director of business development Larry Kuperman and lead producer on Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition Dimitris Giannakis have discussed the troubled development of the project with PCGamesN.

Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick blamed a "softer economy" for a downturn in revenue for both halves of the now-combined Take-Two and mobile giant Zynga. 


The now-completed buyout has also left a $117m hole in the company's bottom line due to business acquisition costs.

"I don't think we had an aggressive attitude," he said. "When you're accused of things that go against everything you believe in, everything you've done in your life, it hurts. It went beyond just attacking the studio culture.

Alongside that, and the usual set of bug fixes, the patch also adjusts White Mask Varre’s questline, making it possible to finish it without having to invade other players.
Update 1.06's first new feature is expanding the reach of summon signs. Players can now send their signs to multiple summoning pools, making it easier for them to get a match. You can even do this for "distant areas," but that doesn't include the Mohgwyn Palace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wish I could tell you that the older and more tedious I get the more I see the appeal of dictionaries. In truth, I was born old and tedious, and I have loved dictionaries forever. I am unable to escape their gravity - I open the book to look up one thing, and then something else draws my eye, and that leads to something else, and something else...


This is particularly true of the dictionaries I love best: speciality dictionaries. Do you have a Rhyming Dictionary? You must get one - it's a life-changer, a kind stranger, a park ranger. Ditto a dictionary of historical terms, a dictionary of etymology. Spread out: I have a Who's Who in Ancient Egypt which is pretty well thumbed. And my favourite? The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Words, by George Stone Saussy III.


Check that last part. All dictionaries are wilful and secretly partisan - you can't really have language and definitions without this stuff. But a dictionary that's the work of a single person is going to be something very special. This is as much a way of being as it is a dictionary - it's a private guide to what a certain individual finds noteworthy and worth preserving. I open its pages and it's like being on the receiving end of one of those long transatlantic phone calls from the years before Skype. It's a gas.

        <updated>2022-08-09T09:45:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the start, it was easy for critics to write off Genshin Impact as a shameless Breath of the Wild clone from a country with a reputation for knock-offs. Even when it did gain a following to everyone's surprise, coverage also had a hand-wringing focus on its gacha mechanics. But defying expectations, the free-to-play open world action RPG has gone from strength to strength, raking over $2 billion in its first year of launch on mobile alone, and becoming the most talked about game on Twitter in 2021. Its crossover success to Western markets has established developer miHoYo (or HoYoverse, as it's internationally rebranded itself these days) as a vanguard of the Chinese new wave in big budget game development.


Gone are the days of hearing people refer to this game by its dismissive nickname Breath of the Waifu. Now, people are searching for Genshin-likes instead (and Diluc and Zhongli mains can attest the game has its share of husbandos too). But with an estimated 500+ hours already invested, almost a dozen maxed characters and still so much more to do, it's hard for me to want to play anything else. This is especially true as we approach the 3.0 update, which aims to not only introduce the new tropic-and-desert region of Sumeru but also a new element, Dendro, to mix up combat.


But what about the uninitiated looking to drop into the fantasy world of Teyvat for the first time? At first, Genshin Impact may feel like another victim of feature creep, with updates that have added a city reputation system, your own Animal Crossing-style island getaway, and even a dating sim mini-game with some of its delectable cast. Fortunately, these features gradually unlock as you play and increase your adventure rank, so as not to overwhelm you off the bat. For the first 15-20 hours, you can treat it as an old-fashioned single-player action RPG as you play a mysterious traveller on a quest to find your missing sibling, before getting caught up in a crisis involving a dragon gone berserk.

This comes following a very successful box office return from Sonic The Hedgehog 2, which crossed over the $400 million mark before its run was done (check out this Nintendo Life article for more info). It seems that as though Sonic’s journey through the world of family-friendly cinema is more of a marathon than a sprint.
For those who didn’t watch the previous film, it was pretty good actually, seemingly breaking the curse of awful video game film movie adaptations that seemed an unavoidable barrier for other properties over the past few decades. Editor Alex Donaldson summed it up in their review of the film, writing: “It is ultimately a video game movie that has a heart, and with that heart comes a quality that bucks the trend and actually results in a video game movie you might want to watch a second time.”

The Firaxis strategy game – which was originally supposed to launch in March 2022 – will now release sometime during publisher 2K's current fiscal year, which ends in March 2023.
“We have made the decision to move back the launch timing of Marvel’s Midnight Suns to ensure the teams at Firaxis Games and 2K deliver the best possible experience for our fans,” said the game's publisher in a press release before the Take-Two quarterly earnings call on August 8.
“The title will launch later this fiscal year on Windows PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5." So, expect a new release date to land any time between November and the end of March 2023 (it'll likely be towards the latter end of that spectrum, let's be honest).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purveyors of video game secrets have something new to get excited about following the recent fuss around Nier: Automata's ultimately rather underwhelming church mystery; a hidden two-player mode has been uncovered in Super Punch-Out!!, 28 years after its release on the SNES.


As explained by Unlisted Cheats - a Twitter account specialising in video game "secrets nobody heard about until now" - the discovery was made "while doing some request work" on Super Punch-Out and has revealed two additional cheat codes on top of the sound test and Japanese name input cheats previously known.


The first cheat unlocks a stage select screen enabling players to take on any fighter, including Special Circuit fighters, in a free single match. This can be accessed from Super Punch-Out's title screen by holding down Y and R on Controller 2 and then hitting A or Start on Controller 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K has announced a second delay for developer Firaxis' Marvel-themed tactical RPG Midnight Suns. The title will no longer launch this October as previously annouced and will instead now arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC at some point before the end of 2K's current fiscal year. Other versions are now "TBA".


Announced last August, Marvel's Midnight Suns is superhero strategy game that - drawing inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s - follows a roster of familiar faces, including the Avengers, on an adventure that blends card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.


It was originally due to launch this March, but last November saw Firaxis and 2K make the decision to push its release back toward the end of 2022 in order to "add more story, cinematics and overall polish". June then bought the news that the end was almost in sight, with the game receiving a launch date of 7th October.

After seeing discounts on AMD's first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we're now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia's RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it's been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

That's according to the Hollywood Reporter, which says Bandai Namco is teaming up with Wayfarer Studios (the company behind Disney+ biopic Clouds) to bring Pac-Man to cinemas.


Details are limited right now, but the movie is said to be based on an original idea by Chuck Williams, who'll produce alongside Tim Kwok on behalf of Lightbeam Entertainment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fall Guys' latest Sonic the Hedgehog collaboration will kick off later this week according to a new leak, with Dr Robotnik and Super Sonic outfits also on the way.


A new Sonic/Fall Guys collaboration was, of course, officially announced during June's Sonic Central livestream. However, all Sega was saying at the time was that the game's previously released Sonic and Knuckles skins would be returning this August alongside a new addition - Tails - as part of the hedgehog's 30th Anniversreay celbrations.


Since then, data miners have discovered Fall Guys developer Mediatonic and Sega might have something a little more substantial planned than mere skins, with a special Green Hill Zone inspired stage having recently been discovered squirrelled away in the files.

Compound is a vibrant, exciting and suprisingly punchy VR rogue-lite that features gorgeous retro graphics and a whole lot of fun. Check it out in action in the video below for 30 minutes of totally radical gameplay, yo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent episode of the VG247 ‘Best Games Ever’ Podcast - which is excellent, by the way - Dead Rising became a topic of hot conversation. It feels appropriate that it did - as that episode of the podcast was released just a matter of days before this week’s anniversary of the series, which kicked off back on August 8th 2006.
16 isn’t exactly a tentpole anniversary to mark, but Dead Rising is worth celebrating no matter the year. With classic Capcom horror getting a resurgence thanks to a revitalized Resident Evil push, what better way to capitalize on the newfound thirst for frights than more Dead Rising! To talk about what makes the series so great, and why it deserves to rise from the grave, Alex and Connor talk about what makes the series so great, and what they’d like to see revisited in the future. 
Alex: Well, I don’t quite know where to start. I was the guy who bought up Dead Rising on the podcast - for the episode ‘best game you were ridiculously excited for as a teen’. For me it was a perfect fit for that category; I was 17 at the time, and Dead Rising was the first game of that console generation where I just looked at it and couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The number of zombies! The number of interactive items! How open-ended it appeared! It came out the better part of a year into the 360’s life, but it was the first game of that generation that truly wowed me with that nebulous sense of next-genness.

Well, I'm proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I've bested it. I should say "we", as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie's highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evo 2022 just wrapped up this morning, and as a UK resident who stayed up to watch the whole thing until roughly 30 minutes before work started, it was exhausting. I’m not talking about the run time, I’m talking about the back-to-back banger announcements coming from multiple fighting game developers over the weekend. A large quantity of which, you’ll be happy to know, revolves around the implementation of rollback netcode. 
For those not in the know, rollback netcode has kind of been the hot topic over the past few years (although arguably it’s been heating up for over a decade now), reaching its burning point during the worldwide COVID-19 lockdowns. While before a large chunk of games struggled to match you up with opponents online without lag, dropped frames, or teleporting, we’ve now seen a vast selection of games past present and future featuring this improved netcode moving forward.
While new characters may seem far more exciting for the average player, and this weekend didn’t hold back with announcements for rad new roster additions, it’s way more important in my book to see pre-existing games with entrenched communities get the support they need via online overhauls.

Let's start with the good news: Dragon Ball Fighterz is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X, at some point anyway, and with that will come the fabled rollback netcode (which will also come to the PC version of the game). What's the bad news, you ask? The PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game won't be getting rollback netcode, it looks like.
The news was announced at Evo, and the official Bandai Namco Esports account put out a statement going into a bit more detail. "As a result of our continuous testing to include the rollback system, it has been confirmed that the implementation can be applied to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and we have officially been working on its production," reads the statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of modders have worked together to bring Bloodborne's tight gun parrying to FromSoftware's latest, Elden Ring.
YouTuber and modder Garden of Eyes is collaborating with COTA Studios to create a mod that adds a touch more gunplay to The Lands Between than there used to be, namely Bloodborne's gun parrying system, as spotted by Eurogamer. As well as another mod adding in some skins for our trusty Torrent, and a third mod that restores and reimagines certain weapons.
If you haven't played Bloodborne and experienced the joys of pulling off a gun parry, allow us to explain. In Dark Souls, you typically parry by swinging your shield at just the right time to stagger your opponent. Bloodborne doesn't really have defensive options apart from one crappy shield, however if you time your gunshot just right, you can stagger most enemies in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year on August 16th, the anniversary of the Debian Project takes place.
And several communities around the world celebrate this date by organizing local
meetings in an event called "Debian Day".
So, how about celebrating the 29th anniversary of the Debian Project in 2022 in
your city?
We invite you and your local community to organize Debian Day by hosting an
event with talks, workshops, bug squashing party,
OpenPGP keysigning, etc.
Or simply holding a meeting between people who like Debian in a
bar/pizzeria/cafeteria/restaurant to celebrate. In other words, any type of
meeting is valid!
But remember that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet, so take all necessary
measures to protect attendees.
As the 16th of August falls on a Tuesday, if you think it's better to organize
it during the weekend, no problem. The importance is to celebrate the Debian
Project.
Remember to add your city to the
Debian Day wiki page
There is a list of Debian Local Groups
around the world. If your city is listed, talk to them to organize DebianDay
together.
There is a list of Debian Local Groups

That's according to AisulMV on Twitter, who found that a 'Find a Battle Pass Partner' screen existed within the game's files (thanks, VGC). 


AisulMV stated this feature was for "battle pass linking", and may be introduced alongside season one (which, in case you missed it, has been delayed).

        <updated>2022-08-08T14:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly, which as the name continues to suggest, is our weekly news show where the team discuss what's new in the world of gaming and gaming technology. Veering at full pelt into the silly season, we kick off this episode with the astonishing War Gods Zeus of Child, or God of Warning as it's known on what can laughingly be called the game's title screen. War Gods ZoA was a essentially a shortlived homebrew game of sorts that sneaked onto the Xbox Store last week via the Creators' Collection, an unmoderated 'free for all' that essentially allows anyone to publish to PC and Xbox platforms. We had a few lighthearted requests for a full DF tech analysis so that's how we kick off this week's Direct, with a look at this abomination of a release (thankfully now deleted) running on ALL Xbox platforms. Spoilers: none can sustain a locked 60 frames per second!
There's also discussion of the news that Xbox Series S has more memory given to developers via a new update to the GDK development environment. The question is, can the 'hundreds of megabytes' added to the existing 8GB of memory make a significant difference? Alex suggests that we may see more RT modes, with the new RAM allocated to the BVH structures required to trace rays. As a counterpoint, I suggest that with 12.5GB of RAM available to developers on PS5 (at least at launch - and it's 13.5GB on Xbox) there's still a yawning chasm between Series S and other systems. I think any extra RAM is useful but I'm not sure how much of a game-changer it will be.
Why are developers being told that it's 'hundreds of megabytes' more memory and not a more concrete figure? Since recording the Direct, I've discovered that the amount of memory is somewhat fluid. There's a block of new memory available to all developers, but this can be augmented by disabling system level features the game may not be using, freeing up extra memory that otherwise wouldn't be used anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been possible to play Nintendo Switch games on devices that aren’t the Nintendo Switch for a while now. This is nothing new. But, over the last couple of weeks, I really feel like I’ve sensed a shift in the scale of the conversation – and though it’s anecdotal, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like a sea change.

To explain what I mean, let me give you a little bit of website inside baseball. As you’ve probably noticed, game guides are a major part of the business model for outlets like VG247. What guides we produce are determined by two key factors. 
The first is intuition – we play the game and figure out what we feel people are going to get stuck on or worry about enough to pick up their phone and punch in a search. Once a game is released, we can track what people are typing into Google, Bing, and other such search engines more directly. And if we see a particular search spiking in popularity and frequency, we know that we should probably do a guide on it.

The Direct is planned to be held August 10, so this coming Wednesday, at 2pm BST/ 3pm CEST, and promises about 30 minutes of updates regarding the upcoming third-person-shooter. You'll be able to watch the direct on Nintendo UK's official YouTube channel when it goes live later this week.
Other than that, no specific details on what we can expect to see in the Direct, though obviously Nintendo has plenty to show us considering it's around 30 minutes long. We'll likely see some new weapons and the like. Maybe there will be some surprises along the way considering this is Nintendo who isn't known for going by the book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A survey sent to Overwatch 2 players suggested the game could have $45 skins, but Blizzard has officially commented to say it doesn't represent the final pricing.
The survey asking players about how much they'd be willing to spend on skins and other cosmetics went out towards the end of July, and obviously fans were concerned about the idea of spending up to $45 on a single skin. Now, Blizzard has addressed the survey, telling IGN that it is "not indicative of final pricing."
"This survey is entirely intended to better understand player preferences for different types of Overwatch 2 cosmetics," a Blizzard spokesperson told IGN. "Prices displayed in the survey were randomized per user and are not indicative of final pricing. We plan to share details on our Shop and Battle Pass system closer to our Oct. 4 launch."

Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe's Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don't often blend as well as this, and I'm disappointed that it hasn't got a bigger reception.

Kimberly has a moveset that makes the most of "traditional ninja techniques" but with an added "urban twist". This includes a rather creative use of spray cans and her "trusty portable cassette player". As you would expect, this girl can pack a punch!


Along with Kimberly, Juri will also make her return on Street Fighter 6's release. Apparently she will be "as wicked as ever", with a moveset that will be both new and yet still reassuringly familiar. You can see the ladies' full reveal below.

Perhaps one of the series' most popular characters, Bridget, will be joining the game as a playable character during Season 2 of DLC. 
Perhaps what is even better news for fans is the fact that they are playable right now. In addition to this, Arc System Works also reminded fans that Bridget is not the only new character to be coming to the game during Season 2, with three more brand new characters expected to be introduced over the coming months.
Bridget made their first playable appearance in Guilty Gear X2, with their last appearance as a playable character in Guilty Gear XX Core Plus R. This is the first title since where players will be able to fight as the yo-yo master.

This follows on from the news that the company is ditching its predecessor's lootboxes in favour of a seasonal battle pass and in-game store.

As shared by Twitter user Portergauge, earlier this year Blizzard asked those taking part in the Overwatch 2 beta their thoughts on paying $45 for the new, highest rarity, skin in the upcoming sequel.

Dead By Daylight's Project W chapter is the second Resident Evil chapter to come to Dead by Daylight, and it has since been revealed that Albert Wesker will be joining the roster of killers, with Ada Wong and Rebecca Chamber joining the survivors.
While we certainly got a good look at the new characters during the showcase, as well as some of Behaviour's upcoming games, we weren't fortunate enough to learn of the characters' powers and perks. That being said, reputable leaker, DBDLeaks on Twitter, appears to have shared some details as to what each character will be capable of when introduced to the game.

This new game – of which we currently know precious little about – will be the first entry in the series since Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Which launched way back in 1999. Some 23 years ago. Talk about a comeback, right?

As was the case with SNK's other recent fighting game, King of Fighters 15, no release window or platforms have been named. You can probably expect to wait quite a while for that info; we didn't get more specific information until quite late into the KoF 15 marketing cycle.

Though that only brought us an announcement of an announcement, we at least have some solid information this time around.
For one, we got our first look at Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer... in the form of a fly-through of one of the game's 6v6 maps: Marina Bay Grand Prix. 
The real news, of course, is the all-encompassing Call of Duty: Next event. Scheduled for Thursday, September 15, the showcase will focus entirely on Call of Duty games. It'll feature a proper Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer reveal, details on Warzone 2 and the future of the series, some news on Warzone mobile, as well as live gameplay of Modern Warfare 2.

Playing an Arcane Archer from the Feywild, I’m joined by a lively party that includes a Firbolg Druid, Minotaur Barbarian, Goblin Ranger, and Tiefling Warlock. We’ve had some fun adventures these last few years. Defeating mind flayers and a lich, fighting servants of Lolth, I got shanked on a bridge - many memorable moments. Never solved that mysterious case of stray arrows hitting teammates though, very peculiar. 


D&D inspires creativity, stimulating imaginations through the theatre of the mind. As a popular adaptation target, it left me wondering how game developers capture the spirit of these game. Nick Pechenin, lead systems designer at Larian Studios, happily answered my questions regarding Baldur’s Gate 3, which works off of D&D’s fifth edition. And I didn’t stop there. I can’t claim to be nearly as familiar with Warhammer as I am D&D, but I also approached publisher Slitherine over Black Lab Games’ Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector. 


Speaking with Battlesector's executive producer David Sharrock, he informs me, "When we were coming to the end of our plans for Battlestar Galactica Deadlock, the Slitherine and Black Lab teams sat down and had a chat about where we should go next. The Black Lab Games team were looking to make use of their skills in making great strategy games that look amazing and the Slitherine team had already been in discussions with Games Workshop about how to follow up previous 40k Strategy titles like Armageddon and Sanctus Reach."

The scene then cuts to a close-up of a new model of Kazuya doing the same smile, before the teaser tells us all to "get ready". You can see it for yourself at the end of the clip below.


This brief preview of things to come was then quickly reshared by The Game Awards Twitter account.

The livestream, dubbed Call of Duty Next, will also fully reveal the multiplayer mode featured in the upcoming Modern Warfare 2, and additionally feature Warzone on mobile.


But its Warzone 2.0, or whatever it ends up being called, that is the most intriguing part of this year's Call of Duty offerings. This is the refreshed version of Activision's COD battle royale that we know won't carry over much of your progress - and sounds like it will be an entirely separate entity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 has received a brand new trailer as part of Evo 2022’s Street Fighter 5 tournament - this time revealing Juri and Kimberly as official additions to the cast. Set to launch in 2023, this trailer raises the total official character count to seven as we march closer to the eventual release of the highly anticipated 2D fighter!
Kimberly - a character teased in the background of the initial Street Fighter 6 gameplay showcase earlier this year - is a ninja who has brought their unique 80’s pop culture style to the game, slinging around spray paint and packing her personal cassette player around to high-flying fights. 
Kimberly shares some similarity to Guy, another Ninja who has popped up in Street Fighter numerous times but originally came from the Final Fight series. There’s good reason for this, as its been revealed via an official PlayStation blog post on the reveal that Kimberly is part of his Dojo - another cool callback for Street Fighter lore heads.

Whether this will be the next canon game in the series, Tekken 8, or another spin-off like Tekken Tag Tournament 3 remains to be seen. There's only one thing we know for sure: more Tekken is coming.

The trailer, which you can see embedded above, shows series mainstay and Smash Bros. interloper, Kazuya Mishima, in his ending from the original Tekken.
We get to see him drop his unloving, sociopathic father, Heihachi, off a cliff – and then a snatch of static segues into the 'current' version of Kazuya (complete with red eye and scar) in nice, crisp, modern graphics. "GET READY", the trailer instructs us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
Internet email is becoming more reliant on DKIM, a scheme for having mail servers cryptographically sign emails. The Big Email providers have started silently spambinning messages that lack either DKIM signatures, or SPF. DKIM is arguably less broken than SPF, so I wanted to deploy it.
But it has a problem: if done in a naive way, it makes all your emails non-repudiable, forever. This is not really a desirable property - at least, not desirable for you, although it can be nice for someone who (for example) gets hold of leaked messages obtained by hacking mailboxes.
This problem was described at some length in Matthew Green’s article Ok Google: please publish your DKIM secret keys. Following links from that article does get you to a short script to achieve key rotation but it had…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GNU libc version 2.34 has just been
accepted
into unstable. Getting it ready has been more challenging than other versions,
as this version integrates a few libraries (libpthread, libdl, libutil,
libanl) into libc. While this is handled transparently at runtime, there are a
few corner cases at build time:
For backwards compatibility, empty static archives (e.g. libpthread.a) are
    provided, so that the linker options keep working. However a few cmake
    files shipped in some packages still reference the path to the shared
    library symlink (e.g. libpthread.so) which is now removed.
A few symbols have also been moved from libresolv to libc and their __
    prefix removed. While compatibily symbols are provided in the shared
    library for runtime compatiblity, this does not work at link time for
    static libraries referencing this symbol.
The next challenge is to get it migrating into testing!
For the adventurous persons, GNU libc 2.35 is now
available
in experimental. And as people keep asking, the goal is to get the just released
GNU libc 2.36 into Bookworm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new release 0.1.1 of RApiSerialize is now on CRAN. While this is the first release in seven years (!!), it brings mostly minor internal updates along with the option of using serialization format 3.
The package is used by both my RcppRedis as well as by Travers excellent qs package. Neither one of us has a need to switch to format 3 yet so format 2 remains the default. But along with other standard updates to package internals, it was straightforward to offer the newer format so that is what we did.
Changes in version 0.1.1 (2022-08-07)
Updated CI use to r-ci


Expanded and updated both DESCRIPTION and README.md


Updated package internals to register compiled functions


Add support for serialization format 3, default remains 2


Minor synchronization with upstream



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat to the previous version. More details are at the RApiSerialize page; code, issue tickets etc at the GitHub repository.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

And it looks like shortly after the welcome segment that kicks things off, starting from 6:15pm BST, there will be a 30 minute slot that dives in on the not-so-idyllic Redfall (thanks, Eurogamer).
"The team at Arkane Austin takes you inside their upcoming squad-based vampire shooter with new insights, gameplay details and more!" reads the description of the event. Whether there will be any actual gameplay shown off or not or if just new details are planned to be shared isn't clear, but the promise of "new" will likely hold true in some shape or form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the '90s, a point-and-click adventure game take on Warcraft was in development, and though it was cancelled, a fan has remastered a build of the game that was leaked years ago.
The leak of the cancelled game, Warcraft: Lord of the Clans, appeared online back in 2016, though while very playable, cutscenes were very crunchy and low-resolution, with audio not quite synced, and some cutscenes were simply missing. However, as reported by PC Gamer and first spotted by IndieRetroNews, a fan has spent the past six years remastering all of the cutscenes to make it a bit more enjoyable to experience.
This particular project was led by modder DerSilver83, who paired the release of the mini-remaster with a blog post discussing it. "I have been working on it for the last 6 years and in that time I have done almost all I can do within a reasonable timeframe to complete and enhance the cutscenes," wrote DerSilver83. "For me the game is very much enjoyable now and I see no real use in enhancing the cutscenes any further."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, one of the most popular entries in the series, is getting rereleased, but it'll probably cost you a fair bit of bob.
This latest release comes from Arcade1Up, as a brand new arcade cabinet, bringing things full circle. The cabinet was announced at fighting game championship series Evo, unsurprisingly, and it will make it the most recent, easily available release of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 in years.
You'll be able to pre-order the cabinet from September 8, and while a price hasn't been announced yet, you can probably expect it to cost around $449.99 to $499.99 based on its other cabinets. It has a 17-inch monitor, and features Wi-Fi connectivity for online multiplayer too. Though for those of us in the UK, unfortunately the cabinet will only be able to order in the US and Canada.

It's Evo at the moment, which for those in the know is the biggest fighting game championship around. Numerous games take part in the tournament every year, but this year a relatively concerning question is being asked by PlayStation in a survey sent to players at Evo, one all about everyone's least favourite topic at the moment; NFTs.
The survey, which IGN confirmed was real, asked those answering the survey "Which of the following NFT/ Digital Collectibles would you be most interested in purchasing?" followed by things like "PlayStation Items, Favourite Game Characters," and "Evo-branded" collectibles.

With its plans to break into the PC monitor market, adding support for 2560x1440 functionality makes sense and while the firmware beta works well, a little more work is required to ensure this update delivers everything it should. 


Before going into the specifics, the introduction of this feature shows that Sony is responding more readily to consumer feedback. Not only has support for 1440p monitors been implemented, the firm has also responded to criticisms of its initial implementation of Auto Low Latency Mode support, an option that ba…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In its most recent quarterly earnings call, Square Enix explained its reasoning behind selling off its Western studios. 
Back in May, Square Enix announced it was selling off Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, the studios behind Tomb Raider and Deus Ex respectively. Now, as reported by Polygon, Square Enix has explained in its financial results that this is due to the fact that games from its Western studios might have been cannibalising the sales of its other games, according to analyst David Gibson.
Gibson noted that the sale of the studios and their IPs would have the potential to "improve capital efficiency," i.e. making more money compared to what it's spending, in order to continue to make more money. And according to Gibson, the move to sell these studios to Embracer Group is part of its first phase, with the second phase being "diversification of studio capital structure."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, despite everything suggesting it should be dead in the water, Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development, as it just got a new lead writer.
Beyond Good and Evil 2, the supposedly upcoming sequel to the cult classic original, hasn't exactly had a smooth development. Some version of it has been in development since at least 2008, though its first teaser trailer was the only evidence of its existence until the re-reveal in 2017. In 2020 the game's director Michel Ancel left the games industry entirely, though in 2021 Ubisoft did say it's still in development. And that somehow does still seem to be the case, as the game recently took on a new lead writer, as reported by PC Gamer.
Sarah Arellano, who has done work for Blizzard and Volition, announced the news via her personal Twitter account, which is the most we've heard about the game in the last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first beta test for Zenless Zone Zero is underway, and gameplay has started appearing online giving us a first proper look.
First revealed back in May, Zenless Zone Zero is the next big title from HoYoverse, obviously best known for the insatiably popular Genshin Impact. There's been tasty morsels of gameplay shown here and there since its announcement, but never anything too substantial. August 5 saw the start of the game's first beta test however, and so far it's looking pretty action packed based on gameplay shared online (thanks, PCGamer).
Where Genshin Impact's genre is obviously fantasy, Zenless Zone Zero is much more modern, with some strong Jet Set Radio and The World Ends With You vibes. It also differs in that it's a roguelike, where you explore areas called Hollows to take down monsters. It seems that each mission is made up of various screens, in the very literal TV sense, which each contain their own levels.

We've had our hands on the Smash Bros-like MultiVersus for coming up to two weeks now, so obviously the team at Player First Games will have a stronger idea of what does and doesn't need changing. And based on what Huynh is saying, as spotted by VGC, it's the hitbox and hurtbox system that needs some big changes.
In response to a follower asking if Finn would be receiving a particular nerf, Huynh said "We’ll be looking at Finn in sections, we are working on a big overhaul of our hitbox/hurtbox system so don’t want too many moving parts."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch is well into its fifth year, somehow, and despite some stiff competition from the Steam Deck recently it hasn't lost its lustre nor its position by my side wherever I go: maybe it's something to do with the immense library I've got on mine at this point, filled to the brim with shmups of all sizes in what's long been a speciality of the system. 


Once it was the novelty of having these things on the go, plus the ease of playing vertical scrolling shooting games as intended in 'tate' mode with the screen flipped (and without worrying about permanent damage like I used to when pushing a chunky old CRT on its side to play Ikaruga as Treasure intended). Now it's just the abundance of classics that can be dipped in and out of at leisure - and the thing I love about the humble shmup is how immediate they are, making them perfect for short blasts.


So here's a list of some personal favourites, and a rundown of the shmups that are in almost constant rotation on my Switch. There should be an emphasis on the personal, here - there's no science here, and an awful lot of bias towards my own taste for simple, spectacular shmups rather than those with fussy scoring systems. So there's no Ikaruga here, I'm afraid - apologies, I do love it but I'm not going to pretend to be a master of its rigid polarity-based system (when - or if - Radiant Silvergun ever makes it to the Switch you can be assured it'll be top of this list, though).

After a nine year absence, the game has now returned to Steam and GOG. It's apparently in less than ideal condition, but the community already have fixes for that.

If you don't know the name, it's Hoyoverse's upcoming free-to-play action-RPG which draws on their experience making Genshin Impact (and its many antecedents) but places those combat and RPG systems within a roguelike structure. Because it's now in closed beta, the internet is covered in videos showing it in action, and its action looks nice.

        <id>http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2022/08/06#rcppcctz_0.2.11</id>
        <link href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2022/08/06#rcppcctz_0.2.11"/>
        <updated>2022-08-06T18:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new release 0.2.11 of RcppCCTZ is now on CRAN.
RcppCCTZ uses Rcpp to bring CCTZ to R. CCTZ is a C++ library for translating between absolute and civil times using the rules of a time zone. In fact, it is two libraries. One for dealing with civil time: human-readable dates and times, and one for converting between between absolute and civil times via time zones. And while CCTZ is made by Google(rs), it is not an official Google product. The RcppCCTZ page has a few usage examples and details. This package was the first CRAN package to use CCTZ; by now four others packages include its sources too. Not ideal, but beyond our control.
This version updates the include headers used in the interface API header thanks to a PR by Jing Lu, updates to upstream changes, and switched r-ci CI to r2u.
Changes in version 0.2.11 (2022-08-06)
More specific includes in RcppCCTZ_API.h (Jing Lu in #42 closing #41).


Synchronized with upstream CCTZ (Dirk in #43).


Switched r-ci to r2u use.



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat to the previous version. More details are at the RcppCCTZ page; code, issue tickets etc at the GitHub repository.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than half of Activision Blizzard's revenue came from mobile games in April - June (Q2) 2022.

According to Activision Blizzard's most recent financial report, the developer/publisher generated £535m from its PC and console sales in Q2 2022 - £275m ($332m) on PC and £310m ($376m) consoles - while £688m ($831m) came from its "mobile and ancillary" business, which the company says "primarily include[s] revenues from mobile devices". That's more than 50 per cent of its entire net revenue for the period. 

Part of this, of course, is because Activision acquired mobile developer King in 2016 - and right now, it's the most successful part of ABK's business - but it's likely not coincidental that Diablo Immortal released during this period, too (thanks, PC Gamer).

As first reported by Ars Technica, the "interactive NFTs" of the NiFTy Arcade collection were being minted and sold without the creators' permission, "much less any arrangement for the creators to share in any crypto profits".

GameStop has since confirmed that the person behind NiFTy Arcade has been suspended, but Ars reports that he is still "holding onto the tends of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency he made by selling those NFTs before the suspension". Furthermore, the unlicensed games are also still fully accessible from GameStop's servers.

Based on the popular Korean fantasy series The Bird That Drinks Tears by author Yeong-do Lee, nothing is really known about the in-development title other than the IP it is based on.
Lee's novel was first serialized on an internet forum, and after the conclusion of the series, the book was published in four hardcover volumes. The series features four different races and stars five characters, three of which are tasked with rescuing a Nhaga from its own people.

It includes a new MP9 weapon - the first fully-automatic SMG that uses 9mm - a new vehicle that will see you "zipping down roads with sirens ablaze" (so not for the stealthy, it seems), and the Blue Chip Detector tactical gear which uses primary weapon slots but can be used to scan for enemies within a 100m radius; you'll see the nearest 12 enemies on the map.

We'll also get our collective hands on the brand-new 1500hp Folding Shield and "once again have the opportunity to drop onto the Haven map". The update also brings "familiar foes" from the recently-announced Assassin's Creed season.

I was talking to a guy in a pub about it, who overheard a conversation I was having with someone else and leaped in, delighted to talk to someone, anyone, about games. It was quite endearing. And it was while talking about older games and remakes he said: I don't think anything will ever be as good as the original Deus Ex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise, in both its Switch and PC forms, is fab - Eurogamer called it "as good as video games can get" - and its Sunbreak expansion is perhaps even better. More, then, is an extremely welcome proposition, and we'll soon know exactly what's in store for Sunbreak's first major post-launch update when it's newly announced livestream airs next week.


Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak's incoming digital event will be hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and game director Yoshitake Suzuki, with proceedings due to begin on Twitch next Tuesday, 9th August, at 3pm BST/7am PDT.


Capcom has already teased a little of what's to come in August's Title Update 1, with the Seething Bazelguese and Lucent Nargacuga (from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate respectively) both confirmed as new monster additions to the line-up, while the Forlorn Arena will be added as a new locale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has released another round of fixes for Sonic Origins, its disappointing collection of classic Sonic platformers, this time taking aim at Sonic the Hedgehog 2's troublesome Tails AI.

Since then, Sega has been working to fix some of the game's more egregious problems, and its latest patch - officially known as update 1.04 - leads with an attempt to remedy an widely reported AI issue that would repeatedly cause Tails to goes off-screen in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, unable to rejoin the action.

According to Blizzard vice president Jon Spector, the studio doesn't plan to offer a third beta before release.
"We know players are eager to dive in and have seen questions about the possibility of a third public beta," said Spector on Twitter. "While we will continue testing Overwatch 2  daily internally, we're not planning any additional public beta tests."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Super Smash Bros series is a near-impossible act to follow, but that's exactly the challenge MultiVersus faces as a new, free to play Smash-like from developer Player First Games. Now in open beta on PS5, Xbox Series X, last-gen and PC, it's a 5GB download that lets anyone hop in. It's admittedly light on options - as you may expect from an open beta - but you do get to tinker with 17 characters - all fully voice-acted. Crucially, MultiVersus also launches with robust online play, built from the ground up with rollback netcode - right away giving it an edge over Super Smash Bros Ultimate's online play on Switch. It's off to a good start. Speaking purely on MultiVersus' visual design though as an Unreal Engine 4 title, how much does it get right next to Nintendo's heavyweight? And where…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve continues to tinker behind the scenes with Steam and its latest client beta has officially introduced support for Nintendo's Switch Joy-Con controllers.


As such, those with a preference for Nintendo's dual-handed clutch capsules will now be able to use them across their PC games in a number of different configurations.


There's support for individual Joy-Cons, which can be used as mini gamepad, and two controllers can also be combined into pairs - as is the case on Switch - for a more traditional controller configuration.

It's mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it's long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

Background: one of my favourite video game stories of 2021 was the time when Jota had to quit a FIFA 22 tournament early to play a real-life match that afternoon - and performed a gamer celebration after scoring after just 97 seconds.


Jota celebrated by sitting down and pretending to play FIFA. (Jota continued his impressive form in front of goal by adding a second goal later in the first half. Liverpool went on to win 4-0.)

This month I accepted 420 and rejected 44 packages. The overall number of packages that got accepted was 422.
I am sad to write the following lines, but unfortunately there are people who rather take advantage of others instead of doing a proper maintenance of their packages.
So, in order to find time slots for as much packages in NEW as possible, I no longer write a debian/copyright for others. I know it is a boring task to collect the copyright information, but our policy still requires this. Of course nobody is perfect and certainly one or the other license or copyright holder can be overlooked.

As with the first wave, Nintendo has added eight courses divided into two cups. (Sadly, there's still no sign of extra kart pieces or characters, including Birdo.) And if you're not up to speed (sorry), players have already worked out what many other upcoming DLC courses will likely be. 

Up first  is New York Minute, a lively track from mobile game Mario Kart Tour's roster featuring a checklist of city landmarks. I'll get this out the way now - I am not enamoured with Mario Kart Tour, and the Mushroom Kingdom purist in me bristles at the inclusion of real-world cities.

It's a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don't think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It's a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

Today, we've got former Eurogamer writer Emma Kent back! And it turns out that since moving on from Eurogamer, she's rediscovered a passion for football. And she's thrown herself so fully into it that she'll soon be in the FA Cup! 
She's also been turning out some great pieces for us, including two State of the Game pieces - one on Valheim and one, more recently, on Red Dead Online. And it's that that we dive into first today.

        <updated>2022-08-05T13:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A full eight and half years (!!) since its 0.0.4 release, version 0.0.5 of RcppXts is now on CRAN. The RcppXts package demonstrates how to access the export C API of xts which we contributed a looong time ago.
This release contains an accumulated small set of updates made as the CRAN Policies evolved. We now register and use the shared library routines (updates in both src/init.c and NAMESPACE), turned on continuous integration, switched it from the now disgraces service to another, adopted our portable r-ci along with r2, added badges to the README.md, updated to https URLs, and made sure the methods package (from base R) was actually imported (something Rcpp has a need for at startup). That latter part now triggered a recent email from the CRAN maintainers which prompted this release.
The NEWS entries follow.
Changes in version 0.0.5 (2022-08-05)
Depends on xts 0.9-6 now on CRAN


Exports (and documents) a number of additional functions


Switch CI use to r-ci and r2u


README.md, DESCRIPTION and NEWS.Rd were updated and expanded


NAMESPACE import of the shared library uses registration



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for this release. A bit more information about the package is available here as well as at the GitHub repo.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

Loot box researcher Leon Y Xiao has written a report stating the country's gambling law regulation of video game loot boxes has been ineffective, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz.


Despite the ban, paid loot boxes remained widespread in the top 100 grossing iPhone games in Belgium from 2021, with 82 percent including some form of random monetisation mechanic.

Microsoft says this will give developers "more control over memory", and as such will allow for "[improved] graphics performance in memory-constrained conditions." So, good news indeed.

The latest example of this sees Joel on horseback, as the screen slides between the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same scene.


"Get ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful - and dangerous - journey across America in The Last of Us Part 1," Naughty Dog proclaimed in its tweet with the footage, which you can see below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Dataminer AndyReloads has already filmed himself strutting around like Iron Man in a new suit of armour that lets you wield a chest laser akin to Stark's own arc reactor. 


The design of the armour, and especially the colouring, are obviously Iron Man-themed. But - thankfully - you're not actually Iron Man, and the rest of the design bears resemblence to those warn by the series' technological Isu race.

However, comments have also emerged from an internal conference call concerning the financial report, courtesy of analyst David Gibson.


The sale of Square Enix's western studios - notably Crystal Dynamics and Eidos - was "driven by concerns that the titles cannibalised sales of the rest of the group", with the company aiming to improve capital efficiency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you consider yourself a fan of fantasy, specifically the kind of fantasy written by working class British people who have sadly left this world in a boat drifting towards the sunset, then this new Lord of the Rings Unreal Engine 5 concept trailer might be right up your alley.
Created as a montage of fan-made Unreal Engine 5 projects setexplicitly in Tolkien’s legendary world of orcs, elves, and hobbits, we’re taken around to a variety of famous and recognisable vistas from the story we know and love. This includes a vibrant shower, the doors to Moria, and of course the Tower of Mordor.
Now, we’ve actually highlighted one of these montage concept trailers before. YouTube channel Enfant Terrible often create videos with a similar format and previously took us to the world of Bloodborne, recreated in UE5. It goes a long way in getting your imagination going, if nothing else. Also, it’s always great to see community creatives go ham with the relatively new engine, especially in universes we love.

Total net sales from the last financial quarter (April to June) were 74.8bn yen, a drop of almost 16 percent compared to the same period last year, while operating income was 14.4bn yen, a drop of almost 17 percent. Net income actually rose due to foreign exchange gains.

It’s comfortable and can be worn for hours, for instance. It feels about as sturdy as a lightweight, wireless headset can be, and seems built to withstand the standard-issue wear and tear that’ll come from putting it on, hurriedly ripping it off, and tossing it to one side of the sofa - though I obviously wouldn’t exactly want to sit on it.

As well as that, anyone who finds themselves having fun across the Caribbean-inspired state of Yara will also be able to pick up the game with up to 60% off. This promotion will be available until August 17, and should you choose to buy the game, all of your progress from the free weekend will be carried over.
Players can install the game on consoles, or via Epic, Stadia, and Ubisoft Connect now, with access being revoked on 8 August at 7pm BST / 2pm ET / 11am PT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to March and you might recall reports claiming Microsoft was working on a new family plan for Game Pass. Those reports, it now transpires, were true, and an Insider Preview test of the new scheme is available now in an extremely limited number of countries.


As detailed in a new Microsoft blog post, the Xbox Insider trial version of the scheme will enable anyone with a special Insider Preview Game Pass plan to invite up to four people to share that subscription, with each one then gaining unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's full selection of games, content, and benefits.


The immediate catch right now is that the test is only available to those in Colombia and Ireland. And while the people being added to a subscription by Insiders don't need to be an Insider themselves, they do need a Microsoft account and must be in the same country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following last week's announcement that Frogwares - the developer behind the likes of Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One and The Sinking City - is remaking its 2007 Sherlock/Lovecraft crossover The Awakened, the studio has released a first cinematic trailer for the project, which is seeking Kickstarter funding right now.


The Awakened, if you're unfamiliar, was the third instalment in a series of Frogwares-developed Sherlock Holmes investigatory adventures that has so far spanned nine games, pitting the Baker Street detective against Cthulhu cults and eldritch abominations across Victorian London, Switzerland, New Orleans, and the Scottish Highlands.


Frogwares' remake will see the studio reimagining the title for modern audiences, drawing on its learning from the more recent Sherlock games, and retooling its story to be a continuation of the young Sherlock arc, which started in last year's Chapter One. And if you're curious to know how that might look, the developer has you covered with a new cinematic trailer in which Sherlock and Watson traverse the New Orleans bayous into a strange realm  that, pleasingly, looks to share more than a few aesthetic beats with Frogwares' Lovecraftian The Sinking City.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypt of the Necrodancer, the acclaimed rhythm-based dungeon-crawler from Brace Yourself Games, has - following its first update in five years last month - launched a huge new expansion, titled Synchrony, into Steam early access, bringing new characters, online multiplayer, and more. And if that wasn't enough, there's also some sort of sequel or spin-off on the way.


Getting the latter part of the announcement out of the way first, as details are currently rather limited, the follow-up is called Rift of the Necrodancer and is described as "new standalone rhythm game in the Necrodancer universe." Exactly what form it'll take is currently unclear, but Brace Yourself says to "stay tuned" for more details.


Thankfully, if it's details you want, Crypt of the Necrodancer's newly released Synchrony DLC delivers in spades, arriving alongside an absolutely enormous set of release notes. To summarise though, it brings three new characters, new enemies, new items, online multiplayer, a new Versus mode, full mod support, plus a stack of DLC-exclusive features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells, the ever-expanding rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, continues to swell, this time with the newly released Enter the Panchaku update, which introduces pet petting, a formidable dual frying pan weapon, and more.


The ability to pet your pets in a rogue-like action-platformer mightn't be at the top of your own personal list of exciting additions, but - as revealed in Evil Empire's extremely extensive release notes - the feature is now in, giving players the ability to show their companions some love between biomes. And why wouldn't you want to do that, you monster?


Elsewhere, the free Panchaku update introduces the new Panchaku weapon, which keen-eyed players might recognise as originating in the animated trailer for Dead Cells' Bad Seed expansion. It's described as "two frying pans tied together with a piece of string, which crits on enemies facing you and has a slick combo with hits behind and all around you". It'll also reflect bombs and projectiles mid-combo.

The star of that show? Well, obviously it was Fidough - a freshly-baked dog  Pokémon made of bread, whose popularity has now set the internet ablaze. But, dear viewer, we have questions. If Fidough is bread... can you eat it? Should you eat it? Why wouldn't you eat it? And how does it evolve?


Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss all of this and show off our own two-minute art challenge concepts for whatever Fidough evolves into, while pondering how it might taste.

Vantage was officially unveiled as Apex Legends' 22nd hero at the end of July, in a new Stories from the Outlands video introducing her as a young hunter on the snowy planet of Págos. Adding a sport of drama to her backstory, her mother is an escaped prisoner (wrongly convicted) who was forced to turn herself in after Vantage was badly injured in an accident.


With that lore dump out the way, Respawn has now turned its attention to detailing what Vantage will bring to Apex Legends in gameplay terms, revealing her abilities to be based around two core elements: her sniper rifle and her bat-like companion Echo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel’s Arc Alchemist graphics cards – their first real go at dedicated desktop gaming GPUs in modern times – are in a bit of a weird spot. If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone once wrote - I can't find the piece, of course - that the reason Peanuts is better, and also weirder and sadder, than other gag comic strips is that it has four panels rather than three. Most comic strips find that three is enough, and why wouldn't it be enough? Setup, development, punchline. The fourth panel in Peanuts is where things get weird and sad. A moment after the joke. A human moment, awkward and brilliant and often deeply memorable.


Anyway, I thought of this yesterday when pondering why most XCOM-alike tactics games have two action points, while Hard West 2 has three. 


Let's take it back to the start: Jake Solomon's XCOM reboot Enemy Unknown hit on something very special when it reduced the complexity of a turn-based tactics game down to a simple idea: each unit can do two things per turn. You can move and shoot, or you can move twice, etc etc. It's not really a reduction in complexity, actually, but a clever repositioning of complexity. By making the rules of the game clear and non-fiddly, it allowed players to understand that the really engaging decisions lay out there on the actual battlefield. It wasn't how to move and shoot, it was what you might do through moving and shooting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as "The Laughing Deer Show". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as "barely contained". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really "do" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question "what games would you play for the first time again?" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight developers Behaviour Interactive have announced Meet Your Maker, a first-person building-and-raiding game.
Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the game has you building stand-alone levels called Outposts. The goal is not only to protect your Outpost but to infiltrate those created by other players.
Building focuses on a strategic, block-based design where you will draw from a customizable toolbox. Here you will find traps and guards for your maze-like Outpost. There are also Raiders ready for combat and posed to enter and attempt to take over other players’ creations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long ago, I was a muso. At school I was the kid who never had a lunchtime or afterschool spare between choirs, orchestras, and jazz bands. At university I spent as much time with the musical theatre society as I did studying for my actual music degree. And with Two Point Campus, this gives me one ultimate objective: to create the ultimate fantasy music school.


Before that though, the basics. To those who've played spiritual predecessor Two Point Hospital, Two Point Campus will be very familiar. The two games are near-identical in their approach: take something typically mundane and make a game of it, adding a healthy dose of oddball British humour. The controls are reassuringly familiar, the art style bright, detailed and easily readable, and university life is accompanied by an appropriately 80s soundtrack for all the gossipy, John Hughes drama.


The game's campaign is essentially an extended tutorial, each new level providing fresh challenges to explain core mechanics and systems, and serving as preparation for the endless customisable sandbox mode. Each campus begins as a blank slate of buildings ready to be filled with lecture halls, classrooms, dormitories, bathrooms, private tuition rooms, libraries, and more. Staff need to be hired to teach, clean up, and keep students happy. Students have their own needs which pop up in the form of mission requests: I need a party! I need a bookcase to study! I need a love bench! (More on that later).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you're a manager with a budget and you've got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you're not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you're in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you're able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that's uniquely yours.

A reported by Reuters, the firm has expressed interest in increasing its stake in the game maker. Back in 2018, it acquired a 5% stake in Ubisoft, and as of press time, it's unclear how much more of a stake Tencent plans to purchase, but it wants to become the single largest shareholder.
Currently valued at $5.3 billion, the Guillemot family, who founded Ubisoft, owns 15.9% of company shares and 22.3% of the net voting shares. It's said Tencent could offer up to $101.84 per share to gain additional stakes - a premium of 127% to the stock's $44.81 average price over the past three months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus season one has been delayed to at least August 15, being pushed back for just over a week from the original seasonal start date. Originally, this was due to go live on August 8, but due to these unforeseen delays announced via social media, players will have to wait a little while longer to progress through a new battle pass.
In addition, this means Morty is also being delayed to a yet-to-be-announced time in the future. The extended season time can be either good or bad depending on your progress through it, but the push back of the second DLC character is a rough blow to pretty much everyone.
Game director Tony Huynh seems to be taking the development hard, tweeting from their personal account “I’m very unhappy that we disappointed players”. Now, delays do happen, especially in games that are receiving new content at a fast pace like MultiVersus, so it’s reasonable to expect bumps in the road every now and again.

Most notably, The Ascent arrived on PlayStation, and received various bits of smaller add-ons. But no meaningful new content made it into the game since then, and this is about to change.
Neon Giant today revealed Cyber Heist, a major new DLC for The Ascent. The add-on arrives August 18, priced $10/€10/£8. Cyber Heist adds new main and side mission chains, set in a new Malhorst-Gelb-owned arcology. The story takes place after the events of the main campaign, with Kira offering you a new job.

It was revealed that the developer has plenty of plans up its sleeve, including two new games in the works, but of course, Albert Wesker stole the show.
Dead by Daylight was in receipt of its first Resident Evil chapter in summer of last year. The introduction of fan favourites, Nemesis, Leon Kennedy, and Jill Valentine, saw the game reach its highest player count yet on Steam.

Following last weeks' free update to The Sims 4, which now allows players to choose the sexual orientation of their sims, a couple of unusual bugs emerged as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems part of the plan at this point, but a few things from the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 have leaked thanks to a private event with NFL players. 
Activision invited the Los Angeles Rams to play an early version of the multiplayer shooter this week, resulting in a few of the players showing content that's yet to be officially announced, before they deleted their tweets, replacing them with generic shots of event banners.
Nothing can ever be truly gone from the internet, however, so Call of Duty fans anxious for some new information about Modern Warfare 2 saved and analysed the images for all for all of us. The first one of these is a fairly benign shot of the game's lobby, which shows a similar layout to the more recent Call of Duty games.

2nd largest tea plantation in the country. Lot of people 
visit here on summer and in winter as well. I live in the neighboring district of Munnar though I never made a visit. In my mind I pictured Munnar as a Tourist trap 
with lots of garbage lying around.
I recently made a visit and it changed my perception of this place.

Little background
I never liked tea much. I am also not a coffee person either. But if I 
have to choose over two that will be coffee because of the strong aroma. 
Going to relatives house, they always offered hot tea defacto. I 
always find difficult say ‘no’ to their friendly gesture. But I hate 
tea.

The latest encounter came at the worst possible moment, after I had spent an hour painstakingly hunting animals to fill up my wagon with pelts. I had set off on a trader mission across the map, opting for a risky long-haul voyage that left me open to attack.
A potential shootout with a player was a risk I could accept: combating an invisible god-like assailant, however, was something I really hadn't signed up for. Out of nowhere, I was transformed into a flying saucer. It didn't take long for me to realise what was happening - Red Dead Online is notorious for its cheaters, and one of them had decided to spend their evening targeting me. 


It turns out that driving a wagon as a spaceship is quite difficult. The ship was so vast that it obscured my view, and the glow from its lights made navigating the pitch-black desert almost impossible. Using my mini-map to steer, I somehow made my way to my destination, but my ordeal wasn't over quite yet. I had some bandits to deal with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who've been with Sea of Thieves since its release back in 2018, the captaincy update is a thing of legend; originally intended to be the multiplayer pirate adventure's very first post-launch update, it would give players the opportunity to acquire their own persistent vessel on the seas, and - in a proposition that still excites the pirate in me to this day - start their sessions in a gloriously dramatic fashion, bursting through the Legendary Hideout's massive waterfall out into the world. But then Sea of Thieves' slightly wobbly launch happened, and Rare shifted its focus to fleshing out the game's sandbox following criticism of its limited core. With that, the captaincy update was set aside, but never quite forgotten by the player base, gradually becoming the stuff of legend with the passing of time.


But then, earlier this year, it returned. As announced during Microsoft's June showcase, captaincy and boat ownership were, after all this time, back on the cards. Now, the wait is finally over, with Sea of Thieves' near-five-years-in-the-making captaincy update launching later today. It promises to deliver an elaborate new framework for adventures to come - minus any waterfall-busting ship shenanigans, unfortunately - and ahead of its arrival Eurogamer had the opportunity to chat with Rare about what it hopes captaincy will bring to the Sea of Thieves.


"I think even before we released Sea of Thieves," explains creative director Mike Chapman on the update's genesis, "we all knew that the idea of being a ship captain in a game about delivering the ultimate pirate fantasy - the idea of a ship captain, and that ship captain's identity being personified through a ship - was just something that we always wanted to do."

On the offensive side of things, there are new gesture combos to the Pro Stick, which 2K says has allowed it to "expand the dunking controls to let you dunk exactly how you want".

In hardware, Switch sales declined 22.9% to 3.43 million units partially due to the addition of the Nintendo Switch – OLED Model with its high unit price to the hardware lineup. But Nintendo said that factors such as the global shortage of semiconductor components impacted production, resulting in a decrease in hardware shipments and a subsequent decline in overall sales.

Halfbrick - also the studio responsible for mobile classic Fruit Ninja - initially announced an iOS and Android sequel to Jetpack Joyride back in February 2021, with an accompanying trailer suggesting some very familiar action, albeit with a slightly slicker new HD art style.


That announcement was accompanied by a limited launch in select territories, but Halfbrick suddenly pulled the game from Google Play and the iOS App Store in March this year, saying it had "entered a new closed phase of development for an indefinite period".

This is according to a Bloomberg report which states the mobile version of the MMO was in development for three years before being canceled.
The report states the cancellation resulted in the disbandment of a 100-strong team at NetEase, with only some offered positions elsewhere in the company.

The Pokémon Company had already announced the Pokémon Centre pop-up store will be returning to London, but hadn't given away any details on what new Pikachu design will be appearing. Images of the plushies have now been released, via today's Pokémon livestream.
The previous pop-up store in 2018 had Pikachu suited up and topped off with a bowler hat, and was so popular the store ended up having to limit purchases and opening hours in order to cope with demand. This time, Pikachu has an even more iconic London look.

The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is impossible to get your head around memory. It's intangible, yet all-powerful. It can be like living with a ghost, but the ghost is Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
If I was making a game about my own memories, my own experience of interacting with memory, I am confident that it would be the worst game ever made. An open-world affair, but an endlessly glitchy one. Landmarks disappear and shift. The same journey can take hours one day and seconds the next, and when you reach the destination it's entirely different anyway. And wherever you go, you're always at the centre of the map. I do not want to play this game.
But what about a game exploring someone else's memories? What form would that take? What problems might it run into? Hindsight is an attempt to answer the first question, I think, and it also provides plenty of answers to the second.

As reported by Bloomberg, the unannounced project - internally known as Neptune and in development for three years - wasn't a direct adaptation of the existing WoW MMO, but rather an MMORPG spin-off set in the same universe but during a different time period.


However, despite the project's already lengthy development period, NetEase is now said to have disbanded its creative team - consisting of more than 100 developers - after a disagreement with Activision Blizzard "over financial terms" resulted in both parties pulling the plug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All Elite Wrestling announced like, I dunno, three games at once a couple of years ago. They all sounded terrible and we haven't posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren't on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE's series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we'll see more gameplay at next week's THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

But alas, the Stray modding community continues to give, and I am therefore compelled to continue cataloguing their work (see, that one wasn't even noticeable! That wasn't painful now, was it?).


First up, there's another mod for the dog lovers among us, thanks to MrMarco1003, this time with Bolt from the titular Disney movie. The mod also changes Stray's meows into barks, and you'll get to see Bolt chilling out with his identically-shaped fur-iends at the beginning of the game. 


With the dog lovers placated, let's move onto the modifications for us cat lovers.

"What if Sonic Triple Trouble had been originally released on the Sega Genesis / MegaDrive, after Sonic 3 and Knuckles," asked fan game developer Noah Copeland. Well, Copeland not only asked this question, but they also answered it.
After releasing a demo for their creation several years ago, yesterday saw Copeland's passion project fully realised (thanks, The Deleter).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 7th 2020, Microsoft kicked off the new generation of consoles with a gameplay showcase featuring a wide range of games planned for the Xbox Series X - and Bright Memory: Infinite was the very first game shown off during this presentation. Now, more than two years later - and half a year after the arrival of the PC version - Bright Memory: Infinite has arrived on console. Given its prominent placement in that original showcase, I felt that we needed to check it out here on Digital Foundry. On the face of it, this is indeed a 'next-gen only' exclusive - you can't play the game on PS4 or Xbox One consoles - which makes the launch of a Nintendo Switch version all the more intriguing.


Bright Memory: Infinite is a fast-paced first-person shooter which combines snappy gunplay with sword driven melee combat. It's not a long game but what's here is solid and reasonably well executed - it almost recalls the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior, though with more focused, linear level design. Plus, if you're playing on the latest consoles, Bright Memory Infinite promises support for 120Hz output and ray traced reflections, though not simultaneously.


Where it surprises the most, perhaps, is in its development history. Bright Memory: Infinite is a showpiece title for what modern development tools can offer when in the right hands - you see, most of the development duties on the game were executed by one person. In creating the game, Infinite was built using Unreal Engine 4 with additional support software and Quixel assets to speed up development time. That's not to say this is entirely a solo project - artists, musicians and voice actors were all required to complete the game but considering the quality of the presentation, it's an impressive accomplishment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NBA 2K23 is nearly with us, releasing September 9 this year. In the build up to launch, we’ve learnt a lot about the gameplay changes coming to the hugely popular basketball game. This includes improvements to shooting, dribbling, and blocking with new gesture combos, AI improvements, accessibility features and more.
We’ve broken down each major change coming with the latest release from 2K, so if you want to hit the court running, check out each major gameplay change coming to NBA 2K23 below!
First, there’s the pro stick and a vast selection of new gesture combos coming to it. Players have been able to flick or hold the stick to do more complex shots since 2K21, but with this entry, a new selection of options are coming for dexterous players. Speaking of shots, skill dunks were a tad too strong last year, so that’s been touched up to be more complex. This includes a physics-based rim hanging system.

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can't be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023's sports management game Roller Drama.

These details came from an audition script for a role in the game, and told of Lara Croft leading a team of younger tomb raiders as she deals with the isolation of success. 


Now, Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has issued a DMCA takedown notice to the Sacred Symbols Patreon, which leaked the audition script in question - and in doing so pretty much verified the details as accurate. 


Sacred Symbols has since released a video about this takedown, saying the company had "[forced] our hand" on the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

We're expecting around 20 minutes of announcements and footage, including a deeper dive into this year's highly-anticipated Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, due for Nintendo Switch in time for Christmas. (Stand by for more Lechonk!)
These shows typically pack in updates on other Pokémon spin-offs too, so expect a brief mention of things like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Go or Pokémon Cafe Mix. And finally, after years of waiting will we finally hear more about Pokémon Sleep?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch exclusive Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has earned the biggest UK launch yet for the series, in terms of boxed sales figures. 


But the critically-acclaimed RPG missed out on becoming the franchise's most lucrative launch to date - largely because it launched without its more-expensive Definitive Edition, GamesIndustry.biz reported.


As you may recall, the extra contents of Xenoblade Chronicles 3's Definitive Edition are now slated for launch later this year, due to "unforeseen logistical challenges".

That's why one modder has taken matters into their own hands and taken drastic measures: chopping down the Erdtree.


For the unfamiliar, the Ertree is the giant golden tree that not only dominates the world with its shimmering branches, but dominates the narrative and the lives of the inhabitants in The Lands Between.

Following an event that allowed the team early access to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, several images and snippets from the game have made their way onto the internet. You could say, these leaks are ram-pant.


The first image shows off the game's upcoming multiplayer lobby, which you can see in the tweet below. This image was originally shared by NFL player Cameron Dicker, although they clearly realised the error of their ways and swiftly removed the shot from their socials. This is the internet, however, and of course once it was out there, the Call of Duty community got wind of it and saved it for posterity.

The new version of SteamOS has plenty of new features as well as bug fixes.


Following Valve's warning a couple of weeks ago about the Steam Deck's performance in high temperatures,  temperature notifications have been added which warn you when the console goes outside of the safe operating range. Fashionably late to the heatwave, but handy for anyone who's enjoying the last of the summer time.

It's not all bad news, however. Switch game sales remain brisk, with more games sold to consumers year-on-year and a solid start for Nintendo Switch Sports (which has now notched up 4.84m copies).


Nintendo highlighted several other first-party games to have sold well over the past three months: Mario Strikers Battle League shifted 1.91m copies, while Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold another 1.88m, taking it to a total of 4.53m and making it the best-selling Kirby game ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doug Cockle said something to me once that always stayed with me. He said when he recorded his lines for The Witcher games - he played the English Geralt of Rivia - he did them alone. He never recorded with any of the other actors - he barely met them. And I found that so strange - I still do. But I get it. I understand that in order to give meaningful dialogue choice, you need to cut performances up so you can stick them back together again in the way the player wants. And the greater the interactivity, the more you need to do it.
The problem with this is disjointedness: pauses in conversations where there would normally be none, mismatched tone where there wouldn't normally be any. Sometimes it's obvious, sometimes it's not. And however good the performer - and direction and sticking back together - the result is never quite what it's aiming to be: natural. Because it's not.
South of the Circle got me thinking about this again. It's a smallish game that came out on Apple Arcade a couple of years ago and resurfaced on PC and Switch this week, and I'm very glad it did, because it has some of the best performances in a game I have ever witnessed.

Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn't a massive discount, but it's a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

results for many different encoders (although they might have wanted to spend
a little more pixels on that latest one…), but you always feel suspicious
that the results might be a bit cherry-picked. In particular, SVT-AV1 always
seems to run on pretty wide machines (in this case, 48 cores/96 threads),
and I wondered whether this was the primary reason for it doing so ell.
So I made my own test, with the kind of footage I care about (a sports clip)
at the speeds that I care about (realtime).
I intentionally restricted the encoders to 16 cores (no HT, since that was
the easiest), and tried various bitrates until I hit VMAF 85, which felt l…]]></summary>

The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone’s definition of value is different. For video games, this means debates constantly encircle the topics of price opposed to content and the need versus greed of rereleasing older games on newer hardware. 

A prime example of these debates comes with this September's The Last Of Us, Part 1. A remake/remaster (I’m honestly not sure what to call it) of a game from 2013, this PS5 title will keep the core gameplay of the original, whilst improving the visuals, animations and AI, and add new DualSense capabilities, accessibility features and a slew of bonuses.
The inherent value of The Last Of Us, Part 1 comes down to each purchaser's differing context. Some may have never played it before, be that because of a lack of accessibility options or access to hardware, whilst others may just want to jump back into one of their favourite games with some improvements. If this was a new version of Dark Souls, I’m sure I’d eat it up, even if I thought it was overpriced.

It's called War Gods Zeus of Child, is priced £3.39, and lets you jankily control God of War hero Kratos. 


Having bought the game and played it myself, I can tell you it is a worthless, minutes-long experience where you make Kratos slash aimlessly at a never-ending stream of enemies in an arena environment, until you give up or Kratos dies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision released its Q2 financials for the current fiscal year overnight, noting a decline in net revenue due to "lower engagement" in Call of Duty.
For the second quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.64 billion, a year-over-year (yoy) decline compared to $2.30 billion reported during Q2 2021.
That said, segment revenue and operating income grew versus the first quarter of the current fiscal year due to gameplay improvements and seasonal content made available across Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty: Warzone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken is a worldwide phenomenon. This was as true 20 years ago as it is now, long before world tours or stadium esports, with hubs of exceptional fighting game talent travelling across continents and oceans to compete against others in foreign lands.  
Icons of those early days like Ryan “Prodigal Son” Hart paid out of pocket to represent their countries and communities on enemy turf. These days, the practice of travelling for competition is more common with sponsorships, social media, and official systems like the Tekken World Tour boosting the profile of excellent venues run by a passionate few. Now more than ever, your own scene can test its might against the Earth's best. For a single weekend, the world can come to you. 
Except this experience may be in jeopardy for Tekken 7 players this year. The Tekken World Tour – an official Bandai Namco tournament circuit that in the past has done nothing but boost the prestige of global communities – may have undone this momentum with a handful of significant changes to its rules. With professional players, tournament organizers, and spectators alike puzzled by these adjustments, what are the repercussions of these changes for the worldwide Tekken scene?

Available from today is Ghost Recon Wildlands on cloud, console and PC, the Tom Clancy co-op military shooter from 2017 - we called it "beautiful yet callous" in our review.



The remaining games coming soon are headed up by Two Point Campus, the latest sim game from the makers of Two Point Hospital. It's out day one on 9th August across cloud, console, and PC and judging from our preview will be well worth playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With any new game with a colourful roster of guest characters, fans of MultiVersus have been picking out their personal favourites they’d like to see make it to the popular platform fighter. Some, however, are bringing their passion to a whole other level with fan made animations and custom calling cards for a particular Looney classic: Daffy Duck.
This all started thanks to one animator - Jordan Rutter. A junior animator at Playtonic Games, he started a side project creating a character concept for Daffy Duck at the tail end of July. From there, clips of combos, aerials, and special moves all inspired by classic moments from the lovable duck were quickly published online, gaining traction among the community.
This excellent animation work in turn inspired some more creative juices to get flowing. Technical designer Dylan Micheli stepped up to the digital plate with their own Daffy work - this time a custom calling card for the character that you’d see in game, with all of his conceptual special moves included!

Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

However, Activision Blizzard's latest financial results show Blizzard active users have only recovered slightly - to where they were just over a year ago - and revenue remains down slightly year-on-year. 


After falling to 22 million monthly active users for the quarter ending in March 2022, Diablo Immortal has helped Blizzard back to 27 million for the quarter ending at the beginning of July.

That's according to Joseph Staten, head of creative at 343 Industries, speaking on the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences podcast Game Maker's Notebook (thanks TechRadar).


Infinite was the first open world Halo game so it's understandable there were several changes during development, but in particular the scope and biome variety were heavily revised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is Strange is set to receive its first novel for the episodic series, and it'll be a direct prequel to last year's game, True Colors. Announced via Twitter, the novel is expected to hit the shelves on March 21, 2023.
The novel, which will be subtitled Steph's Story, will follow main character Steph Gingrich and her bandmate, Izzie, as they go on tour. This is the same tour that eventually lands them in Haven Springs, where the game True Colors plays out.
This prequel is not the first time that Life is Strange has experimented with other mediums, with the series also having multiple comics attached to it since it's conception in 2015. These comics begin where the original game left off and the series of graphic novels only ended this year; if you've not yet read them, there's six volumes to catch up on. That said, you can obviously enjoy the Life is Strange games, and even the upcoming novel, without any prior reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent five minutes with MultiVersus over the weekend, which turned into ten minutes and then an hour and then the best part of a morning. MultiVersus is great! If you aren't aware of it, it's a Warner Bros-themed Smash Bros-alike. You choose from a bunch of familiar characters, and then fight on 2D stages. Your aim is to get ring-outs by lobbing enemies off the screen, and the more damage you do, the further they fly when you hit them. Best of four wins. Simple.


Not simple, obviously, and here's where an admission comes in. I love the idea of Smash Bros - and I particularly adore the way that the games have become sort of Nintendo museums, beautiful virtual dioramas in their own right. But I am thick and slow and these games have always looked fast and complicated. All of these Nintendo characters, some of which I am happy to admit I have not really heard of, fighting it out in astonishingly swift battles.


I think there are two reasons MultiVersus clicked. Three actually, the bonus third being that I was playing alongside my daughter, whose enthusiasm for these things always carries me aloft with it. Anyway, the other two reasons: One, MultiVersus is new, so there's that sense of getting in on the ground floor. Even if people are turning up with Smash Bros experience - and they are, and it's helping them - the psychological toll is lightened, because this is a game that's been around for a few weeks at most.

What's more, Western customers will need to purchase the console through Amazon Japan's storefront due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, reports Polygon.


The console was originally intended as a Japan-only product, but "by using Amazon's 'Japan Store' system, we found that at least a small number of units could be sold via Amazon.com, so a portion was allocated to make the North American version," says a Sega representative.

Initial strong picks like Taz and Bugs Bunny have been discovered and patched, but the latest peak of competitive jank comes from an unlikely combo: Jake the Dog and Velma.
Showcased perfectly by a short Twitter clip from user LeviathanMVS, this combo allows players to quickly shoot off numerous hard to avoid projectiles from the pair. This, as you can imagine, chunks enemies for tons of damage struggle free.
Here’s how it works. You first start with Velma’s Spread the Knowledge (down special attack) which has her throw a book towards her ally. If it hits, both Velma and her ally gain a massive burst of cooldown reduction! This at the start of the match, when your teammate is right next to you, is a cakewalk to land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DICE rolled out a new patch for Battlefield 2042 this morning, making it the second since the launch of the game's first season in June. Update 1.2 will also be the last one before the new season begins in September.
Much of the patch's content was revealed ahead of time. The headline is undoubtedly the map rework of Kaleidoscope, which the developer showed a work-in-progress version of a couple of months ago.
The rework improves the flow of the map by adding a lot more cover, changing the flag arrangement, and altering train elevations. The map also looks different, exchanging the pristine look for a war-torn face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years back, in a bid to explain Fortnite's unexplainable world, Epic Games came up with the term "Snapshot" to describe, in-universe, why its battle royale matches can feature multiple people playing as the same Fortnite character, or why seemingly singular characters available in Fortnite - like Peely the banana, or The Rock, or Wolverine - can reappear under different guises. 


What is a Snapshot? Why is it a Snapshot? Dear reader, these are questions for another time. But the general term, at least, has stuck with me as I try to sum up what Fortnite was, and is, and will be. If you'd asked me five years ago today, I'd say it was a distinctly average PVE base building shooter - and the first time Eurogamer ever really covered Fortnite in detail was a preview of this now long-sidelined mode.


If you'd asked me four years ago, as Fortnite's quickly-thrown-together battle royale was blowing up and footballers were doing its dances in World Cup matches, I'd say it was probably The Next Big Thing. Three years ago? Fortnite was established as a phenomenon, an industry-leading showcase of engine mastery and live service development that could pull off in-game stunts like no other. Want to blow up bits of the map in real-time with a giant volcano? No problem. Stage a giant monster versus mech fight and invite everyone in to see it live? You got it.

And it's not just about electric cars, but virtual ones too. On Friday night the second Accelerate esports championship took centre stage at the London E-Prix. Streamed live on Twitch and YouTube, it saw drivers going head-to-head to win a share of €100,000.


The esports arm of Formula E grew during the pandemic and a need to engage racing fans online. Now that's shifted towards expanding the audience of the sport, enticing fans to watch the real E-Prix through a love of video games and esports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week marks the very long-awaited arrival of Sea of Thieves' captaincy update, and developer Rare has shared a detailed video breakdown of its new features - including ship owning, naming, and extended customisation - as part of its new Season 7 trailer.


Those who've been with Sea of Thieves for the long haul might recall that captaincy features were originally planned for the game's very first post-release update, back in 2018. A development rethink after a wobbly launch saw those plans put on the back burner, so it was a bit of a surprise when they finally resurfaced some four years later during this year's not-E3.


And now, with this Thursday's slightly delayed launch almost upon us, we have a much clearer idea of how the update will work, with Rare's new video suggesting at least one of the aims of captaincy is to answer player calls for more to spend their amassed in-game wealth on.

Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you're not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it's one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I wrote about on how to get my
buggy Keychron C1 keyboard working properly on Linux by setting a kernel module
parameter. Afterwards, I contacted Hans de Goede since he was the last
one that contributed a major patch to the relevant kernel module. After some
debugging, it turned out that the Keychron keyboards are indeed misbehaving
when set to Windows mode. Almost a year later, Bryan Cain provided a
patch fixing the behavior, which has now been merged to the Linux kernel in
5.19.
Thank you, Hans and Bryan!]]></summary>

Edgerunners, which was announced back in June 2020, is a 10-episode collaboration between Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger, which has previously worked on the likes of Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill. It tells the story of a street kid trying to survive in the technology and body modification obsessed Night City.


"Having everything to lose," explains Netflix, "he stays alive by becoming an Edgerunner - a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DICE has detailed its imminent 1.2 update for the beleaguered Battlefield 2042, which will, among other things, herald its first batch of planned map improvements based on the player feedback it requested earlier this year.


This initial round of improvements will target Battlefield 2042's Kaleidoscope map, and will - as previously detailed - focus on adjustments to cover, intensity, line of sight, pathing, and traversal. These have been achieved by adding new flag positions, by placing new areas and assets around the map, and by raising terrain.


DICE says terrain changes will "break sightlines and let infantry move more purposefully around the map", while new assets will "bring more tactical destruction", giving players new options as the environment evolves throughout a game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve finally gotten our first piece of Project L news this year, and it’s a big one. Project L will be free to play! This may not come as a massive shock to fans of other Riot Games projects, but in the AAA fighting game scene this is a massive leap. In addition, it was revealed that the mystical bruiser Illaoi will also be joining the base roster of the game, as elaborated in a dedicated blog post.
The video also gives a brief update on the current state of development for the game. The core gameplay development is finished, leaving character development, competitive or social features. Also, while microtransactions will be present Tom stated: We operate with one approach - if we don’t like it, we won’t do it. When it comes to monetization we promise to be respectful of your time and your wallet”.
As it stands right now, there aren’t many big budget fighting games out there that have taken the leap into a free-to-play model. MultiVersus is the largest and most recent example and while it may have shot to the moon with 100,000 concurrent PC players on launch, it’s impossible to gauge what portion of that success comes from the free cost of entry or the colourful cast. Nonetheless, not having to pay to play is a massive boon for the title’s accessibility.

I'm playing Aran's Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It's a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends' 14th season, officially known as Hunted, is right around the corner, and Respawn is currently in full-on hype mode ahead of its 9th August arrival. And now, following the official unveiling of new hero Vantage last week, the developer now confirmed a major overhaul for its original Kings Canyon map, alongside a level cap increase for players.


Kings Canyon has, of course, been around since Apex Legends' launch back in 2019, and Season 14's extensive overhaul aims to improve some of the ageing map's more troublesome issues. Before we get to the mechanical stuff though, there's perhaps the most immediately obvious change - upgraded lighting and a new skybox, both intended to make for a "more immersive, vibrant environment".


In terms of gameplay changes though, there's the new Relic point of interest, which is designed to help create a little bit more breathing space on the map in the early to mid game so squad battles are less likely to be interrupted by third parties. This has been achieved by filling the Skull Town and Thunderdome area sunk in Season 5 with sand and building a new series of winding, interconnected buildings for fresh skirmishes, complete with a giant skull centerpiece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray is a deeply unbelievable game. It isn’t the hostile, fleshy monsters that chase you through the sewers which stretch credulity to breaking point. A race of maintenance robots that have evolved individuality and self-awareness after the death of their creators doesn’t seem completely outside the realm of possibility. What completely obliterates the willing suspension of disbelief is the ridiculous idea that a cat would ever help anybody.  

Have you ever heard of a bomb-sniffing cat? Seen anyone with a guide cat? Of course you haven’t. Yet Stray is a story about a cat that not only actively helps everyone it meets, but follows direct instructions. This can no longer be accurately described as Science Fiction, make no mistake – Stray is a work of High Fantasy. 
Stray depicts the journey of an ugly orange cat wandering through a robot-populated, quarantined city, inexplicably bringing happiness everywhere it goes. Every robot that meets it can’t help but beam at it, gigantic cutesy emojis flashing on their television faces. Absolutely everyone is delighted to meet it, melting whenever the horrid thing brushes up against them. Stray is quite simply a work of feline propaganda, creating a deeply unbelievable world where even the very notion of vague indifference towards the animal has been excised.

If you haven't heard of the feature, don't worry, literally nobody else has, and Sony knows that too, as a notice was placed on the PlayStation website announcing the removal of the feature.
"In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported," reads the notice. "The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vast new sweep of information regarding the future of Apex Legends has been revealed, via an early press and influencer briefing we attended last week. Alongside multiple reveals regarding Season 14 and significant changes to Kings Canyon, we’ve learnt more about Respawn’s long term goals via a Q&A – including info on cross progression, ranked changes, and in-game gifting.
These further out additions haven’t got any date attributed to them yet, instead being tinkered with in the background. According to senior game designer Eric Canavese: “We are actively working on gifting to other players right now, but we want to make sure it’s something people enjoy, something that doesn’t feel grindy”.
On Cross Progression, Evan stated: “We’re actively working on cross progression, but there’s no release date on it. The game wasn’t built with it in mind, which makes it complicated. But I hear you, and I want cross progression too. It’s something we’re definitely working on – we want it sooner than later.”

This is Digital Foundry's weekly show, where the team down tools for an hour or so to discuss the latest gaming and technology news. After a couple of weeks away, myself and John Linneman have returned to the mics, discussing the latest PlayStation 4 firmware beta offering 1440p display support, along with sharing some thoughts on the latest The Last of Us Part 1 footage. VR is also a hot topic too, with Sony revealing new headset features in the same week that Meta ups prices on the Oculus Meta Quest 2 and the massive multi-billion burn-rate on its metaverse gamble comes into focus.
Kicking off with PlayStation 5's 1440p update, we'll be covering this more extensively, but the headline points are fairly straightforward…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, the next game from the creators of Nioh, is set to receive a demon "in the near future."
Announced at Xbox and Bethesda's Games Showcase in June, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a new action title from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, and through an announcement on the game's official Twitter, it was confirmed that it would be receiving  a "gameplay trial in the near future." The announcement was no more specific than that, though it did outline some other details we can expect. 
Like Nioh 2, Wo Long will also have a character creator, which is always fun to play around with. It sounds like similarly to Nioh it will have challenging gameplay, though considering the reveal trailer only included cinematics, it's unclear how the game actually will play. But we can probably assume it will build upon what Nioh established.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so we’ve already been over the so-so games coming in 2022 that we’re probably going to give a chance, but what about the games we actually can’t wait to play? 
Well, in this second part of the feature, we’ll be exploring that very subject. It’s clear most of the games that would easily end up on this list have been pushed back to 2023. That said, between the precious few that (so far) are sticking to their 2022 guns, and the couple of your under-the-radar, sleeper hit contenders still to come, this year won’t actually end up being that dire when all is said and done.
As mentioned in the first part, this is obviously not an objective list; it only reflects my own picks. The two sets of games could easily be reversed if someone else was in charge, and it is admittedly easier to do this in our current 2022 than it would’ve been had even half of the games we thought we’d be playing actually arrived.

In Brazil, companies within the same sphere of any such corporate transaction are asked for their thoughts on deals of this magnitude. And, intriguingly for us, Brazil also posts all of these details online (albeit in some cases with redacted passages). 


Sony's response is largely public, and contains a number of arguments which paint the potential of Xbox owning Call of Duty in a problematic light (as spotted by ResetEra, and translated for us by Eurogamer Portugal).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evo - the largest annual fighting game tournament in the world - has announced the Evo Lounge. This will be a dedicated live show running alongside the show August 5 - 6 that will present new game and DLC reveals, as well as curated highlights from the tournament itself. If you’re more interested in the big reveals than the hours upon hours of excellent competition, this is for you.
According to an official PlayStation blog post, the live show “will feature top-shelf curated show coverage, bracket updates, interviews with players, and exciting content and reveals from developers and publishers". We know that Warner Bros, Arc System Works, Capcom, SNK, and Bandai Namco will be present.
So, what is actually going to be shown off? While we don’t know for sure, recent events as well as the current fighting game landscape can help us make some educated guesses. The most obvious of which is Street Fighter 6, which was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation showcase. With only five of the cast revealed (not via leaks), it’s likely that at least one new character will be shown at the show.

We've seen the likes of CJ (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) and America's laziest furball, Garfield, make their way into the game so far, opening up an avenue for modders to do what they do best.
The latest mod to capture our attention introduces Spyro the Dragon as your cute protagonist. I suspect there'll no doubt be a very long line of future character mods to come, but if I say so myself, this feels like the best and most-fitting so far (aside from people modding their own pets into the game!).
Modder, MrMarco1003, has plucked Spyro from the Reignited Trilogy and popped them into Stray. They've even gone as far as replacing the other cats from the games prologue with fellow drakes, too.

With the advent of day one patches, it's pretty rare that we're actually playing the game that arrives on the disc. This is also true of Elden Ring, as the 1.0 version's late game area Leyndell had some noticeable differences. And thanks to modder kotn3l, we now know what the 1.0 version of Malenia was like (as spotted by PCGamer).
FromSoftware's games and bosses are often very complex, with almost puzzle-like enemies, as their patterns are something you need to figure out how to overcome. These patterns need a lot of fine tuning, and it's clear from kotn3l's video that Malenia's were a bit too tough compared to how she is now.

"Blizzard did reach out to me," jtitsallbusiness said, before stating that a Blizzard representative told them the company had "approved a fix" which will be implemented in the "next coming days".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technically, Smash Bros. Ultimate and new content for it all came to an end back in October 2021, when Kingdom Hearts' Sora was introduced to the fighting game. However, Smash has continued to live on not just through its loyal community, but through the creative screenshots of its director, Masahiro Sakurai.
Sakurai started, and committed to, a long-standing tradition of posting screenshots from the game to Twitter every day. These screenshots in particular have been of great joy and amusement to many Smash fans, simply due to the fact that Sakurai manages to capture characters and environments so perfectly in each of them. The below shot is definitely a perfect example of how passionate the Wii Fit trainers can get about a fight.
That said, the playful tradition is set to come to an end. In a recent tweet, Masahiro Sakurai shared that it looks as though he'll run out of screenshots this August. He claims that he'd even taken an additional 200 screenshots towards the end of development, making it hard to believe they're gone so quickly.

However, fans of Beahm have given the footage a mixed reception - especially after the project was hyped up by the streamer and compared to Call of Duty. In June, a widely-shared comment by Beahm stated that Deadrop "blows out anything from the COD engine". 


What we're seeing today is a look at Deadrop as it stands currently, for those who paid $50 for a Founders Access Pass (yes, that's the one which includes a procedurally-generated NFT for your character avatar).

As detailed on YouTube by Kotn3l (spotted by PC Gamer), the game's most infamous boss, Malenia, used to have slight differences to her moveset that made her even more aggressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As much as I love Star Wars and as much as I love virtual reality, I've always been slightly disappointed by Disney's official Star Wars VR offerings.
It's not that they're bad, mind. I've had a lot of fun with them, especially EA's Star Wars: Squadrons. My problem is that they always feel like they do the bare minimum when it comes to immersion or run time.
I think Disney's episodic VR games like the Vader Immortal trilogy are a good example of this. The pitch for that series in particular is great. Use the Force! Shoot blasters! Fight Vader! But, it all comes at the cost of a very slow and plodding adventure that has the pacing speed of a Bantha. When they work, they work. But most of the time they feel like bite sized adventures that were built to pass the time in a queue for a ride at Galaxy's Edge, rather than be an epic space adventure in their own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot to love with MultiVersus. Whether it’s the cool cast of characters, the player-friendly approach to live service, or the healthy dollop of wackiness you really kind of need in this kind of light-hearted title. But for those who care about the performance of the games they play, or have a competitive streak, you’ll be happy to hear that MultiVersus is leading the pack on the technical side too!
This was first discovered by Twitter user Nigel Woodall, a reputable input lag tester - who posted their discoveries online. The most crucial for players is an average input lag delay of 31.47 milliseconds on the PS5, which is less than two frames of delay at 60 FPS.
Okay, so what does this actually mean? Well, in the simplest terms, it means that when you press a button on the PS5 while mashing away at MultiVersus, your move comes out fast. Hella fast, actually. Faster than any other fighting game on the platform right now by at least two frames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s August! How did humanity manage to get ourselves to this point in the year? Well, Valve are celebrating with Steam Survival Fest from today through until August 8th, so good job for stocking up on all those cans of beans and endless loo roll. Although they do increasingly seem to be making trailers for these things, there isn’t one yet, so here’s vid bud Liam trying to claw back his three quid for survival horror Refund Me If You Can instead.

The claim of copying comes from concept artist and Call of Duty fan Sail Lin, who has highlighted images of their own dog skin design, originally uploaded to Artstation back in December 2019.


Writing on Twitter, Lin said he was "very disappointed to see my work being plagiarised by a big company like Activision in this way". Eurogamer has contacted Activision for comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Best Month Ever! is such a (seemingly) unusual game that I didn't know what to make of it after seeing the original trailer, or even after checking out the demo. It's about a white woman named Louise, set in the US during 1969, where she must spend as much time as possible with her Black, biracial son Mitch. This is because Louise has been diagnosed with an illness and has only one month left to live.


The story is told in flashbacks with a voiceover from an adult Mitch, contextualising the choices and decisions made by his mother at the time. Of course, these are choices you end up making through dialogue options throughout the game, creating a Louise whose future characteristics are based on Mitch's observation of your behaviour.


It begins with Louise having to collect her final paycheck from her abusive boss at the nearby diner, with Mitch (supposedly) sitting in the car. Through his eyes, you observe Louise being sexually harassed and make a quick getaway after torching up the boss' car with an old lighter.

That's according to game director Ryan Barnard, who revealed to True Achievements that whilst it will have "narrative pieces", focus on your player's own story and has "an underlying story", the adventure will not be "narrative-driven".

"Skull and Bones is not a narrative-driven game," Barnard explains. “We have narrative pieces - in the game, you'll meet important NPCs called Kingpins which have their own stories that you'll learn as you develop rapport with them by taking on contracts with them. There is an underlying story to the game with which we build the entire world lore, but that's not the main focus. We want players to create their own stories and be able to choose the type of pirate they want to be.

Teaming up with (wonderful) content creator Christopher Odd, Firaxis's five-minute video lets us see how the sorcerer can be best utilised when the card-based strategy game finally drops later this year.

As spotted by NME, Doctor Strange - a support hero - has some interesting tricks up his sleeve, including the ability to heal, protect, and completely conceal himself and allies in battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recently spotted Overwatch 2 survey sure seems to be implying that a single skin could cost as much as $45.
As reported by PCGamesN, Twitter user Porterguage recently shared a survey a friend of theirs received that asked about potential prices for skins in the upcoming Overwatch sort-of-sequel. The survey seems to be asking fairly simple questions that are mostly along the lines of 'would you buy this thing for this amount of money,' but it doesn't paint a perfect picture for the sequel.
One question asked "How likely would you be to purchase a Mythic Skin at a price of $44.99?" Considering this is essentially the cost of an entire game, that does certainly seem to be quite the price tag for one skin. The survey also asks things like the likelihood of buying a weapon charm for $9.99, or a Legendary Skin at $24.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The console wars hit their peak during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, and a former Xbox executive has recently explained why the company encouraged it.
Those of us who lived through the PS3 and Xbox 360 era of pointlessly arguing which console was better know that discussions could sometimes get unnecessarily heated. But former Xbox executive Peter Moore, who helped oversee the company in that era, recently touched on how he "encouraged the console wars," as a way to elicit some healthy competition in his team (thanks, GameSpot).
"We encouraged the console wars, not to create division, but to challenge each other, and when I say each other I mean Microsoft and Sony," said Moore on the Front Office Sports podcast. "If Microsoft hadn't stuck the course after the Xbox, after the red rings of death, gaming would be a poorer place for it, you wouldn't have the competition you have today."

Dark Passenger, the name of the new studio, is led by Jakub Ben and Marcin Michalski, the former having worked as a cinematic artist on The Witcher 3, the latter an animator on Cyberpunk. As reported by PCGamesN, the studio's website describes it as being made up of "gamedev veterans and fresh blood specialists."
While the name of the studio's first project hasn't been revealed yet, Dark Passenger has gone into some detail as to what the game will be like. "Our goal is to create highly exciting on-line experiences that are focused both on cooperation and rivalry," Dark Passenger describes the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great Nier: Automata church mystery of 2022 has finally been solved, and it turns out it really was an intricate mod.
Over the last week or so, the Nier community has truly kicked into gear over a mystery surrounding a video clip shared by a member on the game's subreddit showing an area that had never been seen before. This clip surged in popularity when it was shared by video game hacker Lance McDonald, leading many to question how it was possible. The answer? It was all essentially a PR stunt from three modders unveiling some impressive new tools.
The reason why it was such a mystery is that Nier's modding community couldn't find any of the files in any version of the game. When Nier Automata producer Yosuke Saito and director Yoko Taro both tweeted about the mod, but didn't clear anything up, some believed it could be some kind of marketing move for the upcoming Switch port (which is probably going to be the best way to play the game's side quests).

Across every Sunday this month, we've taken a look at 1080p gaming on Sony's controversial PlayStation 3. We've looked at the beginnings of the full HD dream from Sony's initial marketing claims, through to the late 2006 launch. We've seen triumph and disaster, along with a gradual metamorphosis, with 1080p coming into its own on smaller scale projects with less advanced visuals - punctuated by the arrival of stereoscopic 3D, requiring higher pixel counts, providing a backdoor to further 1080p support for the 'Triple'. In this final chapter, we cover the years 2013 to 2015 - a period of transition as the difficult PS3 era yields to the juggernaut success of PlayStation 4. 
2013 proves to be an intriguing year for 1080p…]]></summary>

Whilst not formally confirmed by either developer Behaviour Interactive nor Resident Evil rights holder, Capcom, credible DBD leaker DBDLeaks has shared some very convincing assets, including images of the icons, outfits, charms, dialogue lines, and character biographies for Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers, and Ada Wong.

Wesker - called "The Mastermind" - will be a playable Killer, and you'll be able to jump into the shoes of Ada and Rebecca as Survivors. While their perks are apparently yet to be finalised, DBDLeaks has shared what they say are Wesker's perks: Superior Anatomy, Awakened Awareness, and Terminus, which collectively allow Wesker to vault faster, see the auras of other Survivors whilst carrying one, and cause Survivors to be "permanently Broken when the exit gates are open".

Interestingly, fans of the RPG don't necessarily think this marks a big departure for the team, though, especially given "how much time [the creators] have put into cultivating the setting of Disco Elysium".

These days Dead by Daylight is thought of as the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate of horror, featuring horror collaborations ranging from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Silent Hill. Resident Evil was a very popular one, and it seems like developer Behaviour Interactive has plans to continue working with Capcom, as more characters from the series have leaked online.
The leaks come from the reliable DBDLeaks Twitter account, which recently showed off the models and outfits of Albert Wesker, the new killer, and Ada Wong and Rebecca Chambers as playable survivors. They all have their classic looks, which will likely please fans of the characters.

As spotted by Polygon, Warzone has recently caused a bit of controversy over a skin that has potentially plagiarised the work of artist Sail Lin. Earlier this week (July 27), Raven Software shared the patch notes for season four of the battle royale which showed an upcoming skin of a Samoyed for operator Kim Tae Young. 
However, Lin took to Twitter to point out just how similar this upcoming skin looks to a piece of their work that they shared to ArtStation in 2019. And they wrote that they believe their work has been plagiarised by Activison, saying that they have reached out to Activision asking for an explanation as to why this happened.

The term JRPG will generally elicit a response of 'oh, this game is gonna be big' in most people. But big can mean different things, like how long the game actually is, or the amount of side quests there are. For Xenoblade Chronicles 3, that comes in the form of the world being essentially five times bigger than the previous entry, at least according to one of the game's directors, Koh Kojima.
Nintendo recently shared an interview with three of the lead developers of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, including Kojima, fellow director Genki Yokota, and writer Tetsuya Takahashi. And in the interview, the three dished out various details about the latest game in the series, as well as the series as a whole.

Getting there
As we traveled with complete camping gear and wanted to stay in our tent, we avoided the high alpine parts of the trail and started just where the trail came down from the Alps and entered the Karst. A great way to get there is to take the night train from Zurich or Munich towards Ljubljana, get off at Jesenice, have breakfast, take the local train to Podbrdo and you can start your tour at 9:15am. From there you can reach the trail at Pedrovo Brdo within 1½h.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the house where I grew up, I shared a room with two older brothers. I was a nosy kid, and I have a lot of happy memories of looking through my brothers' books and whatnot while they weren't around. One day - this is decades back; I can at least remember that it was sunny - I found a paperback that my brother Paul had picked up somewhere. Paul liked science-fiction This was sci-fi. It was by Harry Harrison, and it was one of his Stainless Steel Rat novels.


Actually, it was a very special one, an odd one. But we'll get to that in a second. Harry Harrison was a big deal in 20th century sci-fi, a writer who moved from illustrating comics to turning out novels that existed in the raggedy edge-lands between parodying space operas and reveling in their excesses. However he handled things, he always brought an anti-war message that was sometimes hidden, given the rather conservative genre he worked within. Outside of the Stainless Steel Rat books - the Rat is a charming con-man and occasional hero - he's probably best known for writing the novel that Soylent Green was loosely based upon.


So yes, the book of Paul's I'd found was a bit of an oddity amongst Harrison's output. It was a game book. You Can Be The Stainless Steel Rat was published in 1985, according to my lovely  eBay copy, battered but still with a bit of gloss on the cover. 1985! This means it hit right in the middle of the Choose Your Own Adventure craze, and it cleaves tight to many of the genre's standards, like numbered sections that come with choices at the end.

That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren't happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don't like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

I suppose it means that the weekend is upon us, then, and it means that, hopefully, you will have plenty of time to play some games. To be honest with you, I haven't slept since Thursday night. Friday evening came around, and it turned into one of those nights where my brain just wouldn't shut off.
So, to pass the time until McDonald's opened up for breakfast, I played some games and rocked out. With my earbuds in, of course, so as not to disturb the man of the house. He is grumpier than John Wayne when he wakes up. Plus, I didn't want him killing my gaming and grunge buzz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was 38 years old when I realised I was a bard. I shouldn't really have been surprised - I was Danny Zuko in my high school production of Grease after all, and then I was Frank n' Furter in stockings and suspenders. But the realisation vexed me, because until that point I'd never had much time for bards. They were, as far as I was concerned - and I can barely bring myself to write it now - padding. Oh the hollowness! Oh the shame! How could I ever have been so empty? Yet, perhaps the fault was not entirely my own.
You see, I grew up on bards as interpreted by computer games, and to me, there, they were a forgettable class. They were there only to serve others. In Dark Age of Camelot, which I spent a long time playing, the bard-likes were the speed buff your group needed to get around quickly - that was their purpose. They could do a few other things but none as well as the other classes could. And in World of Warcraft, another game I put a lot of time into, bards weren't a playable class at all.
Look across RPGs and it's a similar story. There's no bard class in the Divinity: Original Sin series, and in Dragon Age, the whole series, the bard only crops up as playable in Origins as a rogue subclass. Those series couldn't be more heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons and yet, the poor old bard doesn't get a look-in. And it leaves you wondering why. Or, it reinforces a belief somewhere in your head that bards aren't good enough to make the cut.

I've had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that's down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start 'old' games all the time, and maybe it's less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I've had a good gaming year, and that's what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Valve's pledge to more than double its Steam Deck shipments back in June, the company has announced that improvements to its supply chain mean it'll now be able to fulfil all current reservations for the handheld gaming PC "by the end of the year".


Steam Deck has, of course, been in massive demand since its unveiling last July, with wait times for reservations rapidly stretching into this year. Unfortunately, supply chain issues forced Valve to delay initial shipments from the end of 2021 into this year, with further rollouts perhaps not as rapid as Valve would have liked.


We've had plenty of updates since then - Valve said it would be ramping up production into "the hundreds of thousands" in March, while June saw it announce shipments would more than double in the coming months - and the latest brings great news for those that already have Steam Deck reservations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shortly after Nintendo released the first wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC in March, data miners uncovered what appeared to be a near-complete list of platforms each new wave would be pulling tracks from - and the recent arrival of Wave 2 appears to validate that leak, giving fans a solid foundation for the giddy speculation of classic tracks still to come.


Following Wave 1's release, data miner Fishguy6564 shared a video of Mario Kart 8's track selection screen with the Booster Course Pass' ten remaining cups unlocked, complete with the platform origin of each included track. The then-unreleased Wave 2's Turnip Cup, for instance, was shown to contain four tracks taken from Mario Kart Tour, SNES, N64, and DS, while Propeller Cup listed tracks from Tour, GBA, Wii, and a final, yet to be defined course.


We now know, following Wave 2's release this week, that those leaked platforms line up perfectly with Mario Kart 8's newly expanded track roster. The final track listing for the Turnip Cup is New York Minute (Mario Kart Tour), Mario Cart Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalimari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS), while the Propeller Cup brings Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and Sky-High Sundae (Tour). Notably, the latter is debuting as part of the Booster Pack but coming to Tour later, which might explain its absent tag in the leak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following an extensive report into the development of Rockstar's hugely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 earlier this week, a few additional claims have surfaced, giving a clearer indication of just how ambitious the project was originally planned to be.


Rockstar finally confirmed development on GTA 6 was "well underway" earlier this year, and while official details remain extremely limited, a report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier on Tuesday shared a number of tantalising details about the project, claiming it'll be set in Miami and will feature the series' first female protagonist as part of a Bonny and Clyde-style duo.


Notably, though, Schreier claimed Rockstar's initial plans were much more ambitious, featuring a map that would include "large swaths of North and South America". Axios' Stephen Totilo has since added a little more detail to those claims, citing his own source as saying Rockstar had earlier planned to have four protagonists in GTA 6, with the action unfolding across three cities.

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

From a small, tight-knit team, Eyes in the Dark: The Curious Case of One Victoria Bloom yielded a 5/5 score in our review for its unique take on, and fresh approach to, the roguelike genre.
The roguelike genre isn’t my favourite. While you can catch me ploughing hours beyond hours into various sims that require a tonne of grinding, roguelikes have never been able to keep me hooked for all that long. Eyes in the Dark, however, felt like a breath of fresh air, and almost like it was made for people like me. For people that have just never gelled with the genre.
We sat down with Under the Stairs’ director, Vladimir Bogdanić, to talk all about how the studio came together, and how Eyes in the Dark came to fruition. From indie development, inspirations, music, and even what the future holds for Under the Stairs, here’s our insight into the world of Under the Stairs and its quaint game, Eyes in the Dark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I've returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It's a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can't quite emulate its predecessor's polish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as "angry playmobil". I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket, the gorgeous but expensive modern Game Boy replacement, gets its first major update today – and it’s bringing with it significant new features.
The new features added today are headlined by the introduction of ‘openFPGA’, something which is an impressive new string to the Analogue Pocket’s bow – while also being a feature that has ruffled feathers in the wider retro gaming community. The update also includes the much-anticipated 1.1 update to the Pocket’s operating system. Which is a bigger deal that it sounds.

Peacockingly described by Analogue as “the future of video game preservation”, openFPGA basically opens up the Analogue Pocket hardware to make it an ecosystem for deploying emulation of other gaming hardware on them device – all using the game-changing FPGA technique.

Neighbours was a huge part of my childhood, as it was for many other people my age, and it was always something I looked forward to watching after school and then discussing in the playground the following day. I vividly remember things like the death of Daphne after a tragic car accident (I think that might have been the first regular TV character I ever saw die)  and how my primary school was abuzz with excitement for an upcoming episode that would feature the wedding of fan favourites Scott and Charlene. 



One storyline in particular has stuck with me all of these years, though, and that was the time Todd Landers got addicted to the video game Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins.

Reality Labs, the division of Meta which works on its virtual reality and metaverse products, posted a net $2.8bn loss over the last three months. 


Revenue during this period saw a 48 percent increase to $452m, which CFO Dave Wehner attributed to sales of Meta Quest 2 during Meta's earnings call with investors, but this was heavily outweighed by the costs and investments Meta is putting into Reality Labs.

Today on Weekly, Martin Robinson dives into Xenoblade Chronicles 3, a game he's just rated Essential and spent the last month playing. What's so good about it? And can I play it if I haven't played the others? We hear it from the horse's mouth. (Note: Martin is not actually a horse.)
Christian Donlan, meanwhile, takes us into the world of Rollderdrome, which looks to be another banger from London-based OlliOlli developer Roll7 - how does it do it? This game is a rollerskates shooter where you need to pull off tricks to power your combat. Donlan is very into it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Watch Dogs was an all-time stinker. Released back in 2014, it represented the absolute nadir of Ubisoft open-world design. It was a dour, joyless slog that had no idea how to actually engage with any of the themes or ideas raised by its near future Big Tech Dystopia setting. The protagonist – Aiden Dogs – instantly became the poster boy for bland, uninspired leading men in videogames.
The whole thing reeked of a design by committee obligation created solely to hype the potential of the upcoming PS4 and Xbox One, one of those swanky trailers for a launch title that’s destined to be quietly cancelled and forgotten about – but this one, inexplicably, made it to release somehow. That really should have been the end of Watch Dogs, and for many of you it probably was. 

It’s hard to imagine a game that had fewer expectations than Watch Dogs 2. It seemed like a mistake at first, something Ubisoft had pencilled into their schedule under the assumption that the first game was going to be a smash hit. Lack of corporate oversight coupled with absolutely zero anticipation probably goes some way to explaining how it ended up being one of the greatest open-world videogames ever made.

For example, someone has taken inspiration from the truly horrifying PT demo, and remade it using the tools from Forge mode.


Spotted by PC Gamer, cosplayer Death Templar shared their PT x Halo hybrid creation on YouTube. As with PT, the player starts in a barren and gloomy room, with only one exit. The difference here, however, is that they have a gun (and I didn't spot a cockroach on the floor).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has announced that Resident Evil Village will receive a free update of accessibility options alongside its long-awaited Winters' Expansion DLC and Gold Edition in October.


The update will add in: subtitle size, colour and background toggles; speaker name display in story mode; closed captions; and a permanent reticle.


It's a small but notable list of options that will hopefully open the modern horror classic to a wider audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that's because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I've enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Apex Legends cinematic trailer has introduced Vantage - a young but talented marksman - to the game. Packing a custom sniper rifle and their pet bat, we see a bit of backstory teased as well as some hints towards what their ability kit could look like in game.
As with all character launch  trailers, we get a lot of time with Vantage allowing us to further understand the backstory established in the Stories from the Outlands trailer released earlier this week. Cutting between a firefight and a one-to-one with their mum in prison, the trailer (embedded below) gives a nice overview of what the deal with Vantage is.
While initially not great in a fight, we see some pretty nifty sniping skills shown off in the trailer too, which give ample room for speculation in regard to her move set. For one, we see her pull down a visor over her right eye, identifying incoming enemies which fits in well with her scout / sniper archetype. We also see her send out her bat mid-combat - here’s hoping they play a bigger part in-game than a cute sidekick!

A new report from The Wrap has revealed that following its buyout by Amazon, MGM has lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films. The studio reportedly had until May of this year to move ahead with a sequel, but that ship has now sailed.


As a result, a "host of Hollywood movie studios" are currently making bids on the rights to the film, with insiders revealing that this has resulted in Alicia Vikander being removed from the project.

The stream showed various assets from the game and the secret church area, before admitting all was done through an in-game mod, which will be made available publicly. The VOD wasn't saved but you can still watch clips of the broadcast.

This is a delay of over two-and-a-half months, but that's sadly not the end of the bad news. Fatshark also said that the Xbox Series X/S version will not arrive on the same date with PC, and will instead launch "shortly after."
The studio shared a statement on Twitter by co-founder and CEO Martin Wahlund, who said the decision to delay the game was hard, but necessary to ensure the day one experience is the best it can be. More specifically, Wahlund cited game stability and performance as two key areas in need of improving. The extra time will also be used to "mature key systems."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dicebreaker Recommends is a series of monthly board game, RPG and other tabletop recommendations from our friends at our sibling site, Dicebreaker. This month, the team go on the hunt in one of the best video game board games around - Bloodborne: The Card Game.
The Soulsborne series has had a mixed showing on the tabletop so far. Arguably the series' most popular entries before the release of Elden Ring earlier this year, the original Dark Souls and cosmic horror Bloodborne, have both seen full-blooded board game and card game adaptations, with Dark Souls also making a recent leap into a D&D-like tabletop RPG.
Until Elden Ring inevitably gets its own tabletop outing, the Soulsborne board games are well worth revisiting when you need a moment to stop dying to Malenia and unwind with some good ol' fashioned cardboard for a couple of hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares, the developer behind last year's investigatory open-world adventure Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, has announced it's remaking Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, a Lovecraft-themed crossover the studio originally released back in 2007.


The Awakened was Frogwares' third Sherlock Holmes adventure, and the developer's ongoing association with the detective has resulted in an additional six instalments in the series since then, meaning it's got years of experience to build on as it reimagines its 2007 title for modern audiences - not to mention its further dalliances with Lovecraft in 2019's The Sinking City.


Frogwares' "full remake and substantial rewrite" of The Awakened will shift the events of the original to serve as a continuation of its young Sherlock arc, started in last year's Chapter One. As such, it'll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an adventure that'll span Victorian London, a Swiss psychiactric ward, the New Orleans bayous, and the Scottish Highlands as the fledging detective wrestles with dark, Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Nintendo announced an N64 controller for use with the Nintendo Switch, and I announced my intention to use it on PC. Narrator's voice: he didn't. 

I've less of an excuse not to do it now however, because a Steam client update released yesterday added Steam Input support for "Nintendo Online classic controllers."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - the promising co-op shooter/melee hybrid from Vermintide developer Fatshark - has been delayed again. It's now due for a PC release on 30th November, with the Xbox Series X/S version arriving "shortly after".


This will, of course, be the second delay for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, which was announced at the tail-end of 2020 for release the following year. Unfortunately, its development - as with many recent games - was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and Fatshark ultimately made the decision to push its launch into 2022 in order to "focus on the level of quality on release, as well as invest in more systems to support Darktide for years to come."


March finally brought the news fans had been waiting for, with Darktide receiving a 13th September release date on PC and Xbox Series X/S, but that's now shifted again.

Calico, for Xbox One and Series X/S, serves up some wholesome life sim action in which players are tasked with rebuilding the local town's cat cafe - choosing its decor, baking its food, and filling it with an assortment of not necessarily feline creatures to bring in the customers. It'll be available as part of Games with Gold from between 1st and 31st August.


ScourgeBringer, Games with Gold's second Xbox One and Series X/S title for the month, is a "fast-paced free-moving roguelite platformer" that sees players, in the role of deadly warrior Kyhra, slashing and shooting their way through a post-apocalyptic world in a bid to save humanity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

Backbone One PlayStation Edition is identical to the existing Backbone One controller, with one key difference: it eschews the original's black colour scheme in favour of pristine white hues inspired by Sony's DualSense wireless controller. However, other familiar DualSense design elements, including parallel thumbsticks, are not replicated.


Sony is promoting the Backbone One PlayStation Edition - which is powered by the connected device - as the perfect companion to its PS Remote Play service, enabling players to stream their games from their PS4 or PS5 consoles to their iPhones using the dedicated App Store app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seven months after launch, Halo Infinite continues to evolve with 343 Industries embarking on an extended beta testing period for campaign co-op. This is a crucial feature for a Halo title, desperately missed on the game's debut - and clearly a challenge for the developer. After all, Halo has transitioned from a linear shooter into an open world experience, with a vast degree of freedom for the player - and the notion that up to four players can travel the map doing whatever they please wouldn't really make sense. 343's solutions are constrictive - but they do work - and overall impressions are favourable. 


First impressions suggest a co-op experience close in nature to those that have gone before - but only because of the nature of the opening brace of campaign chapters. These are entirely linear in nature and 343's strategy in keeping players together is simple: there are certain 'points of no return' - such as passing a door that permanently closes behind you, or kicking off a new cutscene, that reset the positioning for all players. With that in mind, I never felt that the game was artificially keeping us closer together, it felt like a classic Halo co-op experience. 


Obviously, this changes in the open world simply because it has to, with 343 setting up what it calls an Area of Operation - or AOO. This is roughly defined as a maximum distance of 300 metres between players, with warnings starting to kick in at around the 250m metre mark. Once too far apart, the player furthest away from the next objective is auto-killed, spawning closer to his counterpart. The end result is that freedom is curtailed, but the fireteam is kept together, essentially forcing a focus on the next target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray is the first game from French developer, BlueTwelve, and ultimately, it’s an incredibly impressive feat from the team. Not only did Stray claw its way to the top of Steam wishlists the day prior to release, but at the time of writing, it currently sits at the top of Steam’s best of 2022, even surpassing God of War.
In the words of The Aristocats, everybody wants to be a cat, or so it seems. However, while Stray’s four-legged feline is at the forefront of the game, I raise the argument that it is not the Outsider that makes Stray wonderful. Jumping around as elegantly as a cat would, and causing as much destruction and chaos as one would too, is just part of the fun here. On the whole, Stray's hook is the story of hope and friendship at the center of the experience – I’d argue it's that which has really brought people together, especially given the tumultuous times that we’re currently living in. I should also warn, if you’re yet to finish Stray, there are spoilers ahead.
Of course, pet owners are rejoicing in the fact that there’s a game for them. I’m not even a pet owner (right now), and this game made me itch to get a cat again like never before. However, I don’t think it is the cat themselves that stirs up this feeling within me. Instead, it’s how this cat touches the lives of everyone around them, including players of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Goat Simulator 3 - which, in a fine example of a joke gone wildly out of control, is actually the direct sequel to the original Goat Simulator - has been given a release date and will be launching for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 17th November.


The original Goat Simulator, developed by Coffee Stain Studios, launched back in 2014, delivering a daft blast of physics-based nonsense in which players took control of a goat, causing chaos, inflicting damage, and accruing points across an open-world map. 


Its goat-themed mayhem struck a chord and the game went on to sell "millions" of copies, in turn convincing Coffee Stain that a sequel was required. Goat Simulator 3 (because sequential numbering be damned) was announced earlier this year, promising, among other things, a new sandbox world known as San Angora, full of quests, collectibles, and secrets.

What isn't a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That's my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of 'nice' list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week's edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of 'best nice bloke-ness', Nate and Matthew have framed this week's episode as the four people they'd most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's free update to The Sims 4, which will now allow players to choose the sexual orientation of their sims, a rather troublesome bug has emerged. The bug appears to be aging players' characters at an alarming rate.
If, like me, you can't stand to look after toddlers in The Sims 4, this isn't terrible news. However, the bug is not just affecting toddlers. Simply put, no sim is safe.
First reported by PCGamer, it appears that this bug is causing sims to grow from toddlers to seniors in just a matter of minutes. The Sims Community website, however, has reported that the issue is primarily affecting those who are using 'short' and 'long' life spans in the game.

Yesterday's eye-catching report into Rockstar discussed positive changes for employees and suggested this new company outlook could also be reflected in Grand Theft Auto 6, whenever it finally arrives. How important are these changes, and could the industry as a whole benefit? Or should we be calling some of these things out as long overdue, and simply just a bare minimum? 

Also this week, the Nier: Automata secret church/door - the apparent existence of which has been puzzling fans and the wider internet. Is it a brand new discovery? A very clever mod? Or an incredibly elaborate marketing ploy for a new Nier game by the tight-lipped Yoko Taro? Join Ed Nightingale, Ishraq Subhan, Liv Ngan and myself as we try to explain.

Created and presented on YouTube by Teaserplay, we get plenty of character, environment, and conversational shots in the new engine.
The video is currently sitting at a comfy  246,000 views, with numerous fans of the series eager to see the game recreated in modern technology. There are some criticisms of the faces - especially Jimmy’s mug - but this balances out with some genuinely impressive buildings and exterior locations.
This video isn’t a sudden announcement of a full on fan-remake, but instead a concept trailer showcasing what a full on modern remake could look like. According to the description of the video: “We tried to use all the power and features of Unreal Engine 5 to recreate this such as Lumen, Nanite, Ray Tracing and Metahuman to create Jimmy Hopkins and Dr Crabblesnitch's face”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This November, the PS5 will celebrate its second birthday. Despite some first party bangers – Returnal, I'm looking at you – so far, Sony’s machine’s got off to less of a running start and more of an agonising crawl. It’s a problem that Microsoft’s new boxes aren’t immune to either, but cunningly, Xbox has pulled a rabbit out of a hat. The name of its new floppy-eared friend? Game Pass. While Microsoft has been quietly collecting studios and Sony releases a steady stream of exclusives, by Year Two, there’s one clear winner of this console generation: Game Pass.

Boasting over 25 million subscribers and winning over the hearts and minds of value-loving gamers, the slow-build service has been genuinely disruptive to the video games industry. It’s seen this console generation defined less by ‘next gen’ release and more by a shiny new way to consume them. WIth fan twitter accounts happily parroting Xbox’s ‘best deal in gaming’ and fanboyism now gleefully extending to subscription services, it seemed the battle lines for this generation have already been drawn. It was inevitable then, that Sony would throw itself into the subscription service skirmish. It's chosen battle-ready champion? An all-new, three-tiered PS Plus offering. 
Rolling out worldwide last month, in these early days, it’s hardly been the valiant comeback Sony hoped for. Following months of leaked information, PS Plus’s 2.0 ‘grand’ reveal was fired out with… well, less of a bang and more an inaudible whimper. Light on PS1 and PS2 classics and looking from a distance like Poundland Game Pass, Sony’s initial offering reeked of a quick money grab. A poorly copied scrap of ‘subscription service 101’ homework. Yet, it turns out, the reality is far from the disaster it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

The book, which is set to launch on 21st March 2023, will chart the life of fan-favourite D&D lover Steph while on the road with her bandmate Izzie. 


This sounds like the time period which directly precedes last year's True Colors and its Steph-focused DLC chapter Wavelengths, which I enjoyed. That DLC included a few voice clips from Izzie in the form of memories, and hinted at a sad end to Steph's time roadtripping while in a musical duo.

The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, Nintendo released a reminder of something that feels as inevitable as the heat death of the universe – the closure of the digital store fronts that power the 3DS and Wii U, meaning many games available via those download services will enter a state of not-for-sale limbo, risking becoming another piece of abandonware. 

This isn’t exactly a surprise, as Nintendo has a history of outright shutting down the servers and infrastructure for its outdated hardware. The Wii’s digital store was discontinued 3 years ago now. It still sucks, of course – but it’s just a sort of fact of life.

So, the facts right now are that as of the end of August, you’ll no longer be able to add funds to Wii U and 3DS eShop accounts. From next March, you’ll no longer be able to make purchases – though you’ll remain able to redownload anything you already own “for the foreseeable future”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really appreciate when games don't hold your hand. They don't waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn't hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is old, clunky and boring, but at the same time I am entranced by it. This is history I'm playing; the game is 18 years old. There's nothing you can do short of remaking it that's going to make it feel young and exciting again - and Wizards of the Coast tried that last year with Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, and look how that turned out (clue: not well). So all those lumps and bumps I feel while playing it - all those things that have been smoothed by the many waves of action role-playing games since - I don't mind them. In fact, I love them, because they're what revisiting Dark Alliance 2 is all about.
Quick history lesson: Dark Alliance was an experiment, really, in bringing Dungeons & Dragons to console. Interplay didn't want a slower, wordy adventure like BioWare's Baldur's Gate but something more suited to a console audience - something faster, something more action-packed. So it enlisted Snowblind Studios (which would go on to make something of a spiritual successor in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North - remember that? We gave it 4/10) to make one. There was reticence but when BG Dark Alliance came out in 2001, it was surprisingly well received, so a sequel was greenlit.
This time, however, the beloved Black Isle Studios would make it. This was the house of Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and Fallout, a bonafide RPG legend, and its involvement added a layer of intrigue and excitement to the game. But Dark Alliance 2 would also be the last game Black Isle would release, with Interplay closing the studio and laying off all of the staff months before release, and cancelling a Dark Alliance 3 in the process. People from Black Isle would go on to form new studio Obsidian Entertainment thereafter. So there's all this history wrapped up in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer behind Dead by Daylight, Behaviour Interactive, has revealed that it will be hosting its first ever games showcase in early August, 2022.
The event, named Behaviour Beyond, will happen on the eve of the developer's 30th anniversary, and is said to boast a bunch of exciting announcements for Dead by Daylight, but also some key announcements for new games and universes. You'll be able to tune into the showcase via the Behaviour Interactive Twitch and YouTube channels on August 3, from 1:30 PM EDT / 6:30 PM BST.
If you're a fan of Dead by Daylight, which is one of our best horror games of all time, this will no doubt be pretty thrilling news. After the success of the first Resident Evil chapter added to the game, we now know that we're in for a second. However, little details have been shared about this, and this showcase certainly looks to clear up some questions that fans have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal is proof that there's money to be made in hell. Though NetEase and Blizzard are insistent that the "vast majority" of players aren't spending money in the game, it appears the ones that are have some deep pockets indeed.
Though fans have been particularly vocal about the number of microtransactions and the cumulative cost of fully upgrading a character, those that don't mind the expense are bank-rolling the game to some degree. 
New data from mobile analytics company Sensor Tower notes that Diablo Immortal's first eight weeks on the (digital) shelves has seen the game take a massive $100 million in player money. That sounds like a lot – and, indeed it is! – but when it comes to mobile games, it still pales in comparison to Pokemon Go, which hit the $100m mark in just 14 days. The less popular, but still notable, Fire Emblem Heroes took 10 weeks to get to that benchmark (thanks, Eurogamer).

Rockstar's endlessly unspooling criminal playground is weird and sometimes creaky, but it's still beautiful - no other company has captured the rosy opioid bloom of LA light like this - and it's still fun. More than anything, it's unpredictable: whenever you go into GTA Online, you always come out with some kind of story.


Last night Sarah was busy, so I fired it up alone. I wanted to check out the new GTA Online Criminal Enterprises update. But this is important for what follows: I don't regularly play the game myself. I watch it from the sofa a lot, but I almost never pick up the controller.


Criminal Enterprises brings quite a lot to GTA Online as far as I can tell. New weapons and new vehicles are just the start of it. There's also a suite of story missions, though, and this is what I was interested in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The death of a sim can be an emotional time. The Grim Reaper shows up with his scythe in hand, the family gathers around to send their loved one off, and a period of mourning descends upon the house. But, if a Sim has lived a good, long life, this can also be a chance for celebration in recognition of time well spent. 


However, a new glitch was accidentally introduced in a recent update for The Sims 4, and it is fast tracking this whole process. This means that some elderly sims have been dropping dead well before their time. As well as this, children are rapidly becoming teens, teens becoming young adults and so on.


Players are reporting this all happening after a visit to create-a-sim (CAS), or during the loading screens. This is even when the game's "Long Lifespan" is enabled.

First up there's a brand new mod for The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition from legendary VR modder Raicuparta. I've already featured a couple of Rai's flatscreen to VR mods on our YouTube channel, including his excellent Firewatch VR mod and his stunning Outer Wilds VR mod.
On the offical side of things, Straight Back Games, the developer behind the terrifying team-based survival game Devour has just released an official VR update for the game.

That's according to reliable app store analytics firm Sensor Tower, which compared Diablo Immortal's start to that of Pokémon Go (which took just two weeks to rake in $100m) and Fire Emblem Heroes (10 weeks). 


Diablo Immortal revenues now seem set to accelerate, since the app arrived belatedly in China this week.

No, you've not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George!

        <link href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2022-clickhouse-meetup-akvorado"/>
        <updated>2022-07-27T21:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the slides I presented for a ClickHouse SF Bay Area Meetup in
July 2022, hosted by Altinity. They are about Akvorado, a
network flow collector and visualizer, and notably on how it relies on
ClickHouse, a column-oriented database.
Slides in PDF format

The meetup was recorded and available on YouTube. Here is the part
relevant to my presentation, with subtitles:1


I got a few questions about how to get information from the higher
layers, like HTTP. As my use case for Akvorado was at the network
edge, my answers were mostly negative. However, as sFlow is
extensible, when collecting flows from Linux servers instead, you
could embed additional data and they could be exported as well.
I also got a question about doing aggregation in a single table.
ClickHouse can aggregate automatically data using TTL. My answer for
not doing that is partial. There is another reason: the retention
periods of the various tables may overlap. For example, the main table
keeps data for 15 days, but even in these 15 days, if I do a query on
a 12-hour window, it is faster to use the flows_1m0s aggregated
table, unless I request something about ports and IP addresses.
To generate the subtitles, I have used Amazon
Transcribe, the speech-to-text solution from Amazon AWS.
Unfortunately, there is no en-FR language available, which would
have been useful for my terrible accent. While the
subtitles were 100% accurate when the host, Robert Hodge from
Altinity, was speaking, the success rate on my talk was quite
lower. I had to rewrite almost all sentences. However, using
speech-to-text is still useful to get the timings, as it is also
something requiring a lot of work to do manually. ↩︎]]></summary>

"Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some things in this world that just take you completely by surprise. Drop bears, for example. It was a total shock, though, when co-father of the OG Xbox Seamus Blackley revealed earlier this week that the Jurassic World series originally started life as a sequel to 1998's terribly received PC-exclusive Jurassic Park: Trespasser. You can watch the original pitch trailer for Jurassic World that Blackley created below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know those beloved novels you always mean to read, but never quite get around to? Ico is my gaming equivalent. Released in 2001 for Sony’s bulky behemoth, this PS2 classic is heralded as one of the medium’s greatest achievements. If that wasn’t enough of an excuse for a games journalist to just fucking play it already, it’s also part of a trilogy that I utterly adore. Falling head over heels for creator Fumito Ueda’s feverishly anticipated 2016 epic The Last Guardian (remember thinking this would never release?) and most gamers’ first encounter with Ueda (seminal goliath slayer, Shadow Of The Colossus), Ico’s alluring box art has always beckoned. Now, with the PS2 classic available to stream via PS Plus Extra, it was finally time to see what the fuss is all about.

Entirely predictably then, Ico hooks me immediately. When it comes to the navel-gazing ‘games as art’ discourse, there’s a reason that Ico is always highlighted as a shining example. Light on narrative and heavy on ambience, Fumito Ueda’s breakthrough project is a majestic mood piece – a universally relatable adventure that largely avoids cutscenes and, instead, relies on its setting to tell its tale. 
And what a setting. There’s a wonderfully surrealist quality to Ueda’s debut that immediately recalls the ill-fitting, ethereal nature of childhood dreams. Thanks to the PS3’s notoriously difficult-to-emulate cell processor, Ico is only available to stream via Sony’s rebranded PS Now service, giving it an unintentionally murky look. Still, it’s hard to care when the core art style is this good. At times, Ico’s odd camera angles and surrealist pacing make the whole thing feel like a playable Renaissance painting; amping up that dreamlike feel which defies Ico’s dated visuals, oozing a quietly entrancing sense of mystique and dread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus seems to be popping off in a major way ever since it went live in open beta this week. According to SteamDB, an external tool that tracks the concurrent and peak player counts of games that use the platform, the game has shot well over 100,000 concurrent PC players in the last 24 hours. This makes it, by far, the most popular fighting game release for the platform.
Checking now, the game is showing no sign of slowing, with it nearing a whopping 150,000 peak! It’s safe to say that the combination of the game’s free-to-play model, as well as a colourful cast of popular Warner Bros characters, has charmed the gaming community at this moment in time.
It’s also worth noting that the developers - Player First Games - have some significant content updates planned in order to maintain this momentum. Many will know that NBA star Lebron James was added to the cast upon the open beta release, but Rick & Morty are also set to join the roster during the upcoming season one period. Time will tell if these characters paired with the experience of actually playing the game will keep numbers high in the coming weeks.

Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series' history. It sounds like we might have quite some time to wait to play it though, so watch the trailer for GTA Online’s new Criminal Enterprises update below to sate your appetite for misdemeanours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FIFA 23 will make major improvements to the series’ Hypermotion movement system, EA has said.


On next-gen console versions, which now includes PC, these advances will be powered by new motion capture technology and machine learning animations. 


Dubbed Hypermotion2 by EA Sports, players in FIFA 23 will have a greater freedom of motion than in previous years and move less robotically in response to dynamic conditions. These movements draw on motion capture data from more real-life games than previously, which are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that can generate movement animations in real time in response to what’s happening on the pitch in your match.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The free-to-play game scene is booming right now. There’s Apex Legends, Final Fantasy 14, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Warframe – and so, so many more besides. But getting to the front of the pack is hard: there’s an ever-increasing number of competitors, and what was once the domain of experimental up-and-comers is now the killing floor for triple-A developers. Yes, indies can make a name for themselves in the space, but the established studios rule the roost now: it’s hard to be a small fish in a big pond when sharks like Epic, EA, Ubisoft and Bungie are milling about. 

The newest addition to this proverbial feeding frenzy? Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. Teaming up with relatively unknown studio Player First Games (seriously, the outfit doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page at the time of writing), Warner Bros. has wrestled into the free-to-play market in a meaningful way with MultiVersus – a free-to-play crossover fighting game that has pilfered characters from across the expansive Warner Bros. Discovery catalog. If you don’t know the game, it’s like Smash Bros. Except it’s not.
Like Smash, you can select a character from any one of some myriad properties. Instead of Nintendo, though, the roster is picked and chosen from licenses from Warner Bros., DC Comics, HBO, Turner Entertainment, and Cartoon Network. So, you can have characters from Scooby-Doo teabagging Steven Universe, or maybe you’ll see Harley Quinn smash a Game of Thrones character around the face. There’s also an original character, Reindog (half reindeer, half dog), who may quietly be the best character in the game. But don’t tell anyone.

A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.

As per usual, Dealabs leaked the lineup, after having posted the correct lineup of free titles for PS Plus ahead of Sony's official announcement each month.
According to Dealabs' leak, the roster of games is set to include Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 Remake for both PS4 and PS5, with Little Nightmares arriving on PS4 only. And as usual, they were right: Sony has confirmed all three titles are coming to the service in August.

The magical sim was previously exclusive to Apple Arcade, but it has now been announced that the indie will be coming to PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch on September 20, 2022.
The charming indie has you step into the shoes of Tara, as she goes on a heart-warming journey to become a witch and restore her grandmother's farm simultaneously. By day, you'll be tilling soil and tending to your farm, but by night, you'll be bonding with your coven and practicing spells. If you wish to live out a whimsical cottagecore lifestyle, this could be the game for you.

Well, fret not. Atlus knows Persona fans would very much like to see some of the old games revisited and given the remake treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though the news had leaked well ahead of time, the reveal of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake remains one of the biggest surprises in that one State of Play from last September.
Since then, we've heard and seen nothing from developer Aspyr, which makes today's report all the more frustrating.
According to Bloomberg [Paywall], the development of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake has been put on ice. The game has effectively been delayed indefinitely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Urbek City Builder looks like a traditional entry to the genre: you place buildings, cars and little people begin to scurry about, and you gradually expand your urban sprawl. The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bank robberies are classic cowboy fare. Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red's fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

Look at my PlayStation trophies, however, and you’ll spot the sheepish shine of Elden Ring’s platinum. Does that mean I have a story of redemption to share? One in which I go from hating Elden Ring to loving it?

Many of the highly-anticipated games from the year before got pushed back to 2022, and when you consider the games already targeting this year – we were unquestionably in for one of the toughest Game of the Year showdowns. 
Who wins the Breath of the Wild 2 vs Elden Ring fight? Is Rocksteady’s new game after years of dormancy actually good? Will Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga come out this year? What’s the deal with God of War Ragnarok? Will Firaxis do the right thing and take cards out of Midnight Suns? Will the Stalker sequel stand up to the classic games? Will DICE turn Battlefield 2042 around? 
Those, and many others, were all questions on our collective minds around January. The point is: there was no way 2022 was going to have a shortage of big, tentpole games to play and talk about. A few short weeks later, however, reality began to take hold, and, one by one, our most anticipated games got pushed back to 2023 and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray is a cat simulator intertwined with a cyberpunk adventure, and as a result, the game is strewn with dialogue and signs that are, at first, illegible to most. Fortunately, B-12 is the perfect translator, however, Josh Wirtanen of Half-Glass Gaming spent some time decoding the language for all to understand.
Josh started out by decoding the chapter titles, which are displayed both in English and in Stray's language, and he noted a few differences between translations. For example, the chapter 'The Slums' is actually named 'Home: Slums Part One' in the deciphered language.
The same can be said for Sheet Music too. Across The Slums, there are eight pieces of Sheet Music to deliver to Morusque in exchange for a pretty cute badge. One of these pieces of music, as noted by Josh, is titled 'Come On' in the games language, but Morusque calls that same song 'Cool Down'.

Rollerskating has gone in and out of fashion too, and anyone who's glanced at Instagram for the past couple of years will know which stage of the wave we're at. Rollerdrome fuses these two oscillating trends in the story of a rollerskating hotshot with a vendetta against human heads. I got a look at the first few levels and, so far, it's a flashy spin on the slow-mo gun fight.

        <link href="https://www.vg247.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review"/>
        <updated>2022-07-26T12:59:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, probably the most refreshing thing about modern Nintendo is its full-force embracing of the role-playing genre. No series represents this recently-adjusted stance more than Xenoblade – and its latest entry, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, proves that Nintendo’s recent interest and dedication to the genre is paying off dividends.

In many ways, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the culmination of everything developer Monolith Soft has done up to this point. Anybody can appreciate the game – it’s simply a good one. But truly understanding the depth of appreciation it deserves is likely tied to understanding the history of the developer, from when its founders broke free of Square after finding them too obsessed with Final Fantasy over new ideas, through to its days with Bandai Namco, and finally its time as a subsidiary of Nintendo. Here, the developer works on both original games and as a support studio for more widely popular Nintendo titles. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the natural conclusion of all of those events – and it’s wonderful.
This third mainline Xenoblade title is as feature-rich as all of its predecessors, if not more so. As a result, I could easily spend many words talking about the mechanics of the game – but it’ll probably suffice to say that it’s an interesting and engaging action RPG combat system that features familiar elements from Xenoblade 1, 2, and X alike. At first blush, it’s most similar to the second game, however. And that’s no bad thing. That game ruled – with the odd caveat – and so too does this sequel.

Surprsingly, Nacon didn't say how long the delay is going to be. The company simply said it will be "a few months", which is a little unusual. 
With that said, Nacon promised an update with a more solid release date in the near future. The reason for the delay is the very understandable need for polishing the game to make it the best version it can be.

Not only did it top Steam's most-wishlisted the night before its release, but it's now technically become the best game on Steam in 2022, according to user reviews.
Steam250, a platform for tracking and ranking Steam games, shows that Stray has now overtaken Sony Santa Monica's God of War in the process. It seems that everybody wants to be a cat.
First reported on Twitter by SkillUp, Stray currently has 46,244 votes from Steam users and an overall score of 8.61, which simply means that 98% of people enjoyed the game. On the other hand, God of War only trails behind ever so slightly with 53,182 votes and an overall score of 8.56, which means 97% of users are fans of God of War.

Today, there was yet another update to the game's SteamDB page that added a Steam Deck controller profile. What does that mean? The game is probably coming to PC, and it will be playable on Steam Deck (thanks, Resetera).

You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you'll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

SAP is my favourite auto-battler, and offering a whole new meta every week has me coming back long after I would've stopped playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds like EA is publishing a video game all about Black Panther, one that sees the player becoming a new version of the character.
The report comes from Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb during his Game Mess Mornings podcast, claiming that the Black Panther game is currently in early development. The internal name for the title is Project Rainier, and is being developed by a new studio led by former Monolith Productions studio head Kevin Stephens.
The "big open world Black Panther Game," as described by Grubb will see the player taking up the mantle of the superhero after the previous incarnation dies. Apart from that, details are otherwise slim on the title, but it does sound like it will be a single-player title, a departure from EA's previous live service leanings.

The sequel to Breath of the Wild, whatever it might be called, is coming out in spring 2023 (hopefully). That's still about a year away, so all we have is the original game to keep us busy. But playing games by yourself can be a bit solitary in these modern times. Which is where modder Kirbymimi steps in to provide a splitscreen multiplayer mod that is entering into beta this week.
Footage of the mod has been shared online by YouTuber and modder Waikuteru, and it honestly looks really good so far. The mod shows two Links taking on the overrun Hyrule castle, and doesn't seem to run into any trouble performance wise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers will be present and playable by the public at EGX this year! The controversial entry into the legendary SEGA IP has previously split the gaming community into two camps of lovers and haters following its initial gameplay reveal. What better way to make your mind up on the title than to head down to London and try it out yourself.
Sonic Frontiers is the first every fully open world Sonic game, allowing players to dash freely between different locations in the overworld rather than having them progress through a series of levels. While 3D Sonic games have allowed those in control to explore a range of vast areas (looking at you, Sonic 06), this pushes that experience to a vaster extent.
As for EGX, it’s set to start September 22 - 25 at the ExCeL centre in London. If you want to figure out what all the noise is about surrounding this game, this is a great opportunity to get your hands on it yourself. It’s also the first time the public will have a chance to test it out, so Sonic megafans eager to be among the first to control Sonic on his new adventure have ample reason to go.

However, Juventus has signed a new exclusive multi-year contract with EA to appear in their games, in another twist in a rivalry almost as great as the Derby Della Mole between Juve and Torino.

Roller Champions, the free-to-play roller skating action game released by Ubisoft earlier this year, may be on the chopping block soon if Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb is to be believed. If true, this means that news of the game’s demise would have come only two months following its release.
Speaking on the Xbox Era podcast, the journalist from Giant Bomb claims to have recieved information which he then revealed to his peers while on the topic of Ubisoft changes and cancellations. This nonchalant reveal was followed by brief praise for the game, mixed with the shared sentiment that it wasn’t quite exciting enough to keep their interest.

"Based on the 2010 release, the game features improved graphics and sound, as well as updated game design, bringing to life a new Tactics Ogre that remains true to its roots," reads the description of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite's co-op campaign has been eagerly anticipated for a while now, with the beta arriving just last week, but to the dismay of many fans, the new mode will not feature any online matchmaking. This will also persist even after the mode leaves beta, meaning players must recruit friends of their own to play alongside.
This campaign update is currently in beta for Xbox Insiders. The full update, which includes online co-op and split-screen play, is set to fully launch in August of this year.
Online co-op play does not extend to online matchmaking, however, meaning that if you're trying to play co-op online, you'll need to recruit friends to play with yourself.

The leak originates from Discord's developer mode, which one Twitter user was messing with before they stumbled upon a number of events for upcoming games, including seemingly the next Monster Hunter. 
As spotted by VGC, most Discord events they dug up have placeholder names, except one in particular. The original tweet, which has since been deleted, included screenshots of a game called Monster Hunter Paradise on Discord's backend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiversus - the free-to-play platform fighter from Player First games and Warner Bros - looks like it’s setting up for an incredibly popular soft launch. Even before the open beta releases on July 26, the game has reached a peak PC player count of over 60,000 on Steam alone (via SteamDB).
While not an official Valve tool, SteamDB can be a good measure of rough player popularity, if taken with a pinch of salt. With recorded user numbers reaching this all time peak even before waves of eager players are let in, on just one of the three launch platforms, it’s easy to see this title becoming one of the big industry victors this season.
Those who have been playing during previous betas have something to look forward too on launch, as a collection of new characters are joining the roster! This includes American basketball player Lebron James who’ll be popping into the game alongside the open beta, and Rick & Morty who’ll both be in the game during season 1.

Now, however, my first thought is of a very different, unnamed ginger kitty from Stray, but that doesn't mean Garfield doesn't still hold a special place in my heart.
One modder, who clearly has similar interests, has made it so that Garfield finds himself astray in the unknown world of The Slums, Midtown, and beyond. We've seen keen modders flock to Annapurna's most successful launch and turn the protagonist of Stray into a dog, and even into CJ from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Obviously, Garfield is perhaps the most fitting of all the character mods we've seen so far.
If you're one of the many players that are playing Stray via PC, you can also play as Garfield to your heart's content. Modder, Chris Robino, has made the mod publicly available on Nexus Mods.

HalfGlassGaming’s Josh Wirtanen has proffered a handy guide to how to read the chapter titles, signs and music sheets, with help from the growing Stray community.

"Neopets recently became aware that customer data may have been stolen," reads the first tweet. "We immediately launched an investigation assisted by a leading forensics firm. We are also engaging law enforcement and enhancing the protections for our systems and our user data."

Earlier this week, Guerrilla announced on Twitter that online servers would be shutting down for a couple of Killzone games. "On 12 August 2022, online servers for Killzone: Mercenary, Killzone Shadow Fall (including Intercept Mode) and RIGS: Mechanized Combat League will shut down. Online features (including online multiplayer modes) will cease on that date," reads the tweet. But single player modes will still be available. 
RIGS is the most recent of the three titles, having release in 2016, and requires the use of a PSVR headset. So considering the age of all three of them, and the lattermost needing what will soon become an outdated piece of hardware, it isn't particularly surprising that any of them are shutting down.

After some brief testing, it seems
SVT-AV1 is the obvious choice;
if you've got the cores, it produces pretty good-looking 10-bit AV1 using

While there is a nuanced conversation to be had about Steam's refund system, at the very least two hours is a good amount of time to get a feel for most games. Most developers would generally prefer their game to not be refunded if they can help it, but Refund Me If You Can from Sungame Studio actively encourages you to… if you can beat it in time.
Refund Me If You Can's premise is simple: "One maze, one monster tracking you down, will you have the courage and dexterity to escape this nightmare in less than two hours?" You play as someone called Sarah, and only you (the player) can wake her up from a nightmare she's having.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero, the next presumably hit-gacha game from the developers of Genshin Impact, has had its beta test confirmed for this August. 
Hoyoverse has put out a notice confirming the exact time and date of Zenless Zone Zero's Tuning Test (say that five times fast). Those that want to test out the game can signup on the game's main page, and if you get in you can expect to try it out starting from August 5, 3am BST/ 4am CEST. Not the friendliest of start times to those in the UK and the EU, but you take what you can get.
The test end time hasn't been set in stone just yet though, so presumably you'll have a bit of time to really get a feel for the game if you're lucky enough to be picked for the beta. Make sure you do so soon if you are interested though, as signups close next week, July 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Dead by Daylight that think it just isn't anime enough might be happy to know that Dragon Ball: The Breakers is officially out in October.
Revealed last year, Dragon Ball: The Breakers (weird title) is an asymmetrical multiplayer game quite similar to Dead by Daylight, only within the world of Dragon Ball. And it's officially out October 14, bringing one of the most iconic villains from the series, Frieza, along with it.
In the game's previous network test, only Cell was available to play as in terms of villains, with Earth as the main stage to play on. With the latest trailer showing off Frieza, Planet Namek also looks to be another stage the you will be able to survive or hunt on.

Back in 2020, Sonic made his first appearance in the bean-themed battle royale with a skin of the fastest hedgehog alive. So far any collaborations Fall Guys has had with other properties has been relegated to cosmetic, but recently fans have spotted what appears to be an entire Sonic-themed stage coming to the game. 
The screenshot of the Sonic stage was included in the 'next up' screen, most likely as a mistake, but obviously this had fans wondering what this meant. And now, dataminer FGPancake has managed to find the actual stage in the game, as well as load it in and play around in it.

You might remember that back in March there was quite a big Apex Legends leak showing nine potential new characters, including the most recent addition Newcastle. Now it seems that Respawn itself has accidentally shown a brief preview of the next character joining the game, advertising a potential upcoming Stories from the Outlands. If you want to wait for the official reveal though, maybe skip this one.
As reported by Dot Esports, one fan spotted this preview in the Apex client yesterday (July 23), inviting players to watch a Stories from the Outland episode titled Survive. "There's a new installment of the Stories from the Outlands!" reads the description. "Watch survive and meet the new Legend joining the Games in Apex Legends: Hunted, coming August 9!"

created using the "planetplanet" RSS aggregator. A short while later, I
created Planet Grep using the same software.
Over the years, the blog aggregator landscape has changed a bit. First
of all, planetplanet was abandoned, forked into Planet
Venus, and then abandoned again.
Second, the world of blogging (aka the "blogosphere") has disappeared
much, and the more modern world uses things like "Social Networks", etc,
making blogs less relevant these days.
A blog aggregator community site is still useful, however, and so I've
never taken Planet Grep down, even though over the years the number of
blogs that was carried on Planet Grep has been reducing. In the past
almost 20 years, I've just run Planet Grep on my personal server,

debian.org mail. This worked well
for me for a while: outgoing mail was signed with DKIM and somehow was
delivered. Maybe. Who knows.
But now we have a relay server which makes this kind of moot. So
I have changed my configuration to use that relay instead of sending
email on my own. It seems more reliable that mail seems to be coming
from a real debian.org machine, so I'm hoping this will have better
reputation than my current setup.
In general, you should follow the DSA documentation which includes a
Postfix configuration. In my case, it was basically this patch:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the recent resurgence in Covid19 I’ve been working from home a lot and using both my work laptop and personal PC on the same monitor. HDMI KVM switches start at $150 and I didn’t feel like buying one. So I wrote a script to change inputs on my monitor. The following script locks the session on the local machine and switches the monitor’s input to the other machine. I ran the command “ddcutil  vcpinfo| grep Input” which shows that (on my monitor at least) 60 is the VCP for input. Then I ran the command “ddcutil getvcp 60” to get the current value and tried setting values sequentially to find the value for the other port.
Below is the script I’m using on one system, the other is the same but setting the different port via setvcp. The loginctl command is to lock the screen to prevent accidental keyboard or mouse input from messing anything up.
# lock the session, assumes that seat0 is the only session
loginctl lock-session $(loginctl list-sessions|grep "seat0 *$"|cut -c1-7)
# 0xf is DisplayPort, 0x11 is HDMI-1
ddcutil setvcp 60 0x11
For keyboard, mouse, and speakers I’m using a USB 2.0 hub that I can switch between computers. I idly considered getting a three-pole double-throw switch (four pole switches aren’t available at my local electronic store) to switch USB 2.0 as I only need to switch 3 of the 4 wires. But for the moment just plugging the hub into different systems is enough, I only do that a couple of times a day.

Memory sits in the first row after the headers then we have the swap statistics. Most of the numbers are directly fetched from the procfs file /proc/meminfo which are scaled and presented to the user.  A good example of a “simple” stat is total, which is just the MemTotal row located in that file. For the rest of this post, I’ll make the rows from /proc/meminfo hav…]]></summary>

Since I recently managed to configure dnsmasq as a potent TFTP and PXE server, I figured that I'd try chainloading iPXE via BOOTP options. This required preparing a boot image using antiquated tools:
$ sudo mkelf-linux --param=autoboot --output=/srv/tftp/ipxe.nbi /srv/tftp/ipxe.lkrn

The host succesufully loads the boot image, except that the iPXE blob fails to find the network card:

Debian Conference, is taking place in Prizren, Kosovo
from July 17th to 24th, 2022.
Debian contributors from all over the world have come together at
Innovation and Training Park (ITP)
in Prizren, Kosovo, to participate and work in a conference exclusively
run by volunteers.
Today the main conference starts with over 270 attendants expected
and 82 activities scheduled,
including 45-minute and 20-minute talks and team meetings ("BoF"),
workshops, and a job fair, as well as a variety of other events.
The full schedule at
https://debconf2.debconf.org/schedule/
is updated every day, including activities planned ad-hoc
by attendees during the whole conference.
If you want to engage remotely, you can follow the
video streaming available from the DebConf22 website
of the events happening in the three talk rooms:
Drini, Lumbardhi and Ereniku.
Or you can join the conversation about what is happening
in the talk rooms:
  #debconf-drini,
  #debconf-lumbardhi and
  #debconf-ereniku
(all those channels in the OFTC IRC network).
You can also follow the live coverage of news about DebConf22 on
https://micronews.debian.org or the @debian
profile in your favorite social network.
DebConf is committed to a safe and welcoming environment for all participants.

(not just humans in prosthetic makeup), but are mostly earnest,
well-meaning, and welcoming.  Trang's security escort is more military
than he expects, but that becomes a satisfying negotiation rather than an
ongoing problem.  There is confusion, misunderstandings, and even
violence, but most of it is sorted out by earnest discussion and attempts
at mutual understanding.

that control such mathematical machinery that a PID controller is.  It
proved to be a lot harder than I hoped, and I still have not succeeded
in getting the Z PID controller to successfully defy gravity, nor X
and Y to move accurately and reliably.  But while climbing up this
rather steep learning curve, I discovered that some motor control
systems are able to tune their PID controllers.  I got the impression
from the documentation that LinuxCNC were not.  This proved to be not

At least 2 DDs want to upload packages that need a new version of python3-jsonschema (ie: version > 4.x). Unfortunately, version 4 broke a few packages. I therefore uploaded it to Experimental a few months/week, so I could see the result of autopkgtest reading the pseudo excuse page. And it showed a few packages broke. Here’s the one used (or part of) OpenStack:
Nova

Ironic

Thanks to a reactive upstream, I was able to fix the first 4 above, but not Sahara yet. Vitrage poped-up when I uploade Debian release 2 of jsonschema, surprisingly. Also python3-jsonschema autopkgtest itself was broken…]]></summary>

INN 2.7 is now the stable branch, and will be maintained on the 2.7 Git
branch.  The main branch is now open for development targeting 2.8.0.
(I'm still hoping to get to the build system overhaul before 2.8.0 is
released.)  As of tonight, if all goes well, the nightly stable snapshots
will be generated from the 2.7 branch instead of the 2.6 branch, so be
aware that you will need to pay close attention to the upgrade if you're
using a snapshot.



As always, thanks to Julien ÉLIE for preparing this release and doing most
of the maintenance work on INN!



You can get the latest version from
the official ISC download

latter also has links to the other INN documentation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Git-cinnabar is a git remote helper to interact with mercurial repositories. It allows to clone, pull and push from/to mercurial remote repositories, using git.
Get it on github.
These release notes are also available on the git-cinnabar wiki.
What’s new since 0.5.8?
Updated git to 2.37.1 for the helper.
Various python 3 fixes.
Fixed stream bundle
Added python and py.exe as executables tried on top of python3 and python2.
Improved handling of ill-formed local urls.
Fixed using old mercurial libraries that don’t support bundlev2 with a server that does.
When fsck reports the metadata as broken, prevent further updates to the repo.
When issue #207 is detected, mark the metadata as broken
Added support for logging redirection to a file
Now ignore refs/cinnabar/replace/ refs, and always use the corresponding metadata instead.

met in Hamburg between May 23 and May 30 2022 as part of the 
Debian Reunion Hamburg
to continue perl development work for Bookworm and to work on QA tasks across
our 3800+ packages.
The participants had a good time and met other Debian friends. The
sprint was also productive:
pkg-perl-tools and dh-make-perl were improved and extended.
More than 50 uploads were done, and more than 30 bugs were fixed or at least triaged.
autopkgtests were added to lots of packages.
Some requests to remove obsolete packages were filed as well.
The more detailed report
was posted to the Debian Perl mailing list.
The participants would like to thank the Debian Reunion Hamburg organizers
for providing the framework for our sprint, all sponsors of the event, and
all donors to the Debian project who helped to cover parts of our expenses.]]></summary>
