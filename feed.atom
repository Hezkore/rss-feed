The sequel to the critically acclaimed A Plague Tale: Innocence by Asobo Studio and Focus Entertainment, the video shows off some the game's narrative elements.
The game is set six months after the first game, and it seems as though Hugo's curse is under control. To that end, the siblings head south seeking both to start a new life and find a cure for Hugo's affliction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you like it or not, weapon durability is here to stay in games. Whether you’re in the camp that thinks it helped make Breath of the Wild one of the standout games of a generation or not, you need to admit that the controversial system is a permanent fixture. Turn to pretty much any genre of game and you’ll find it there – Yakuza, Dead Rising, Fire Emblem, Far Cry, State of Decay, Minecraft, Zelda, Silent Hill. Weapon degradation is here to stay.

But it’s not a bad thing, is it? Sure, it can seem unrealistic – why would a katana cease to function as a sword after five or six goes? It’s not made of glass (in theory). Using a weapon that functions perfectly well, at full strength, until it breaks so catastrophically you cannot wield it at all is a little unrealistic, in my eyes; would it not dull, or jam, or lose some function first?
But, as a mechanic, I like it. Breaking weapons forces you, as a player, to adapt to the world you’re in. Far Cry 2 would have been far more boring if you could just waltz about with a gun that never jammed, right? Breath of the Wild would have lost a lot of its charm if you could just keep hold of that one early-game sword you loved so much.

FIFA 23 doesn't launch proper until this Friday, 30th September, and its early access wasn't meant to begin until 4pm this afternoon, but the 10-hour EA Play trial was made available a day early, meaning FIFA 23's effective launch was yesterday, 26th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret we're big fans of PowerWash Simulator here at Eurogamer which, for me, makes this hour-long development deep dive video something of a must-watch. 


I've often wondered while playing whether certain objects auto-complete faster than others. If you're yet to try PowerWash yourself, it's worth knowing the game will, after you clean a certain amount of surface area, auto-complete the rest of the object in question. (This also provides a nice 'ding' sound.)


This subject is one of many covered in the developer video, which is ostensibly about how levels in the game are created but also delves into thoughts on dirt design, parkour, and the game's lack of fall damage.

But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So listen reet. I went to EGX last weekend with my sidekick, Daft Connor. He only wanted to play Sonic Frontiers cos he’s daft, look out for an upcoming video preview of that along with some hands-on impressions of other stuff we looked at like Goat Simulator 3, which you’ve heard of, and Shadows of Doubt, which you haven’t.
We accosted Zoe and Ian from Eurogamer to ask them what they were playing at, and Mike Channell from Outside Xbox gave us a tantalising glimpse into the decadent lifestyle afforded him by all that YouTube cash. It was like an episode of MTV Cribs except we were stood on the balcony of an East London conference centre and the only luxuries on offer were a load of Diet Coke cans in a mini-fridge, and he didn’t let us have one.
We spoke to one of the developers of House Flipper 2 and confirmed that you don’t need to play the first one to understand what’s going on. We also confirmed shortly afterwards that security wanted us to leave the House Flipper 2 booth. But Connor flashed them his Gold Wristband and while they were reeling from the revelation that we were in gainful employment with the organisers of the event, we scarpered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's prequel to The Witcher, The Witcher: Blood Origin, will air in December, and the show's creator has shared some information on the upcoming mini-series.
The four-part series is set 1,200 years before the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, and was created by Declan De Barra and The Witcher showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich.
Blood Origin will cover the Conjunction of the Spheres, a cataclysm trapping unnatural creatures such as ghouls and vampires in the dimension where the story takes place. The collision created rifts of different realms bringing with it a force known as chaos or magic. This event also displaced many native races,  unable to fight off so many dangerous creatures. The show will explain how the cataclysm happened, the reasons behind it, and how the first Witcher came to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still remember the first time I played Fortnite. Back then, I was well deep into the PUBG hole, and eager to get my hands on any new battle royale game. Epic Games, too, realised the genre’s potential early, and swiftly pivoted its seldom-discussed crafting and zombie defence game into a battle royale shooter. 
The company moved so quickly, in fact, it caught the ire of PUBG’s developer, who took it to court for blatantly ripping off its ideas. It wasn’t an accident, either; Epic Games directly cited PUBG as the core inspiration behind its then-nascent experiment.  
Game concepts aren’t proprietary, of course, so that lawsuit was never going to go anywhere. Setting aside the argument at the core of the dispute, Fortnite Battle Royale just wasn’t all that interesting back then. It stank of desperation, and the first version Epic put out felt cobbled together (probably because it was made in two months) to ride the crest of PUBG’s unbelievable wave. Its only claim to fame was bringing the instant building mechanic from the co-op defence mode into BR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

        <link href="https://www.vg247.com/the-diofield-chronicle-review"/>
        <updated>2022-09-27T14:02:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The DioField Chronicle has been released, and it’s seemingly pretty much already forgotten. This latest Square Enix strategy RPG is thoughtful, interesting, and flawed – though also pleasantly brisk. It deserves better than it’s getting.

What it’s getting, by the way, feels like the pretty classic small game from Square Enix treatment. It got a surprisingly big-time announcement, making its debut in one of Sony’s high-profile State of Play broadcasts. After that, though, it appeared relegated to second-tier status. It was promoted little, and even review code arrived at the eleventh hour; dropped into the inboxes of media around the world just a few days before Square Enix said reviews could go live - which itself was just a short time before release. That’s why you didn’t see many pre-release reviews, if you’re wondering.

It’s a shame to see a game like this get treatment like that, because it’s interesting. At heart, The DioField Chronicle is a strategy RPG in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics, but it’s ultimately a little faster and looser, and features several elements that inject a little of the real time tactics genre into the mix. The result is something quite thrilling and unique – which is important, since we’re currently in something of a resurgent golden age of strategy RPGs, with Fire Emblem the biggest it’s ever been and even Square Enix giving Tactics Ogre another run-out with an upcoming remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As players of Image & Form's excellent SteamWorld Dig games will know, there is something innately calming about chiselling your way through a hunk of rock. In both of those western-themed platformers, you were hunting for gem-like treasures to take back to the surface so you could get bigger and better equipment to begin the dig cycle anew. Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

The character will be floating down the River Thames, and HoYoVerse are staging an opportunity to get up close at Tower Bridge. Oh, and they’ve chosen the date of the extremely busy London Marathon as the start of Paimon’s journey along the Thames. What a time to be alive.

The first was the Steam Deck Zone filled with thirty of Valve’s handhelds full of games for anyone to pull up a chair and play. The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. 
Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yves Guillemot, boss and co-founder of Ubisoft, has raised eyebrows for his comments on the need for "a little friction" in game development. 


Discussing his company's troubles with harassment and workplace toxicity, as highlighted by a number of employees since the summer of 2020, Guillemot told La Presse that Ubisoft had been "progressing at a good pace" in dealing with its issues - but that "creating a video game is not easy" and sometimes created "a lot of tension". 


"Techniques must be put in place to ensure that everyone succeeds in finding their place," Guillemot continued, now discussing the games industry in general. "To create, you need a little friction, because everyone has to succeed in getting their idea across. It's a job that brings a lot of rewards when you succeed, but it's difficult."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, as part of The Last of Us day, we were treated to the first full trailer for the franchise's upcoming HBO adaptation, starring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This trailer didn't have any real dialogue between the characters (there were plenty of tense looks and some furtive Shh-ing), but it still offered an evocative picture of the world that HBO has created for its TV audience. You can see this trailer for yourself below. 


Right off the bat, it is clear HBO has taken this adaptation seriously, with several scenes looking like they have been pulled straight from Naughty Dog's video game series. There is a lot to unpack in the minute and half or so of footage, so let's dive on in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrating The Last of Us Day, which coincides with the in-universe date that the Cordyceps infection took its toll, HBO and Naughty Dog have revealed a brand-new trailer for the upcoming The Last of Us series.
The trailer, which is just under two minutes in length, shows Joel and Ellie in the midst of the action, as well as some of their counterparts. Additionally, we also get a much closer look, albeit briefly, at what live-action Clickers will look like in the adaptation. 
We obviously know now that Pedro Pascal is stepping into Joel’s shoes, with Bella Ramsey performing as Ellie, but we’ve seen other information trickle in slowly over the past few months. Not only have we already seen a few clips from the show, but we also saw Lamar Johnson and Kevin Woodard revealed as the actors behind Henry and Sam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early access roguelike Darkest Dungeon 2 is getting a major update which reworks the game's progression system - and also resets some player stats, developer Red Hook Games has warned.


The Altar of Hope update adds a new type of reward - Candles of Hope - which you can earn and then spend on various attributes which should make future missions safer for your party.


As you'd expect, the bigger the danger, the bigger reward in terms of Candles bagged at the end. Missions will offer more Candles the further you manage to progress, but suffer a wipe and you'll see your Candle hoard penalised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactics Ogre Reborn producer Hiroaki Kato didn't consider the HD-2D style for the remake, despite its use in this year's Triangle Strategy and Live A Live.


Speaking to IGN, Kato admitted he likes the style but the 2D pixel art of the original has been retained instead.


"No, we didn't think about making it HD-2D," he said. "We kind of played with the idea of making it 3D, but what we were really thinking about was, 'What are the major parts about this game that are really appealing to everybody?' And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn't have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it."

The new patch – which comes along to buff or nerf 15 of the characters in the game – also introduces some changes to how progression works in the title. Per the patch notes themselves, developer Player First Games notes: "The XP required to go from level 3 – 15 on the character mastery track has been doubled."

That may seem extreme, but apparently it's because the developer was seeing people master their characters too quickly. "We were finding that players could get to level 15 of the mastery track too quickly," PFG explains in the patch note update. "This [change] is to help us make it a bit more of a journey."

The latest Simulacrum to be added to the roster of playable AIs, and the first introduced since the game’s global launch, Cobalt-B wields a flaming revolver and dons cute blue pigtails with sunglasses. With her character art shrouded in flames, you just know she’s here to undoubtedly cause some trouble across Aida.
Cobalt-B is a mechanical engineer on the Hykros weapon development team, and she’s said to have an instinct for creating highly effective weapons. What does she do with her projects, however? She tests them on unsuspecting Hyena members.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This summer, I signed up to participate in the Northcape 4000
<https://www.northcape4000.com/>, an annual 4000km bike ride between Rovereto
(in northern Italy) and the northernmost point of Europe, the North cape.
The Northcape event has been held for several years, and while it always ends
on the North Cape, the route there varies. Last years’ route went through the
Baltics, but this years’ was perhaps as direct as possible - taking us through
Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech republic, Germany again, Sweden,
Finland and finally Norway.
The ride is unsupported, meaning you have to find your own food and
accomodation and can only avail yourself of resupply and sleeping options on
the route that are available to everybody else as well. The event is not meant
to be a race (unlike the Transcontinental, which starts at the same day),
so there is a minimum time to finish it in (10 days) and a maximum (21 days).
Unfortunately, this meant skipping some other events I’d wanted attend
(DebConf, MCH).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

This year, to celebrate the occasion, Naughty Dog and HBO have released a new trailer for their upcoming TV adaptation, which stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This new trailer gives us all a closer look at Ellie and Joel in action as they make their way across America. Along with seeing more of the two protagonists, we now also have a better, but still brief look at the series' infected Clickers - complete with their unmistakable and haunting noises. Other characters such as Ellie's friend Riley also make a showing. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

DICE has taken the decision "to competely remove certain sections of the map" which it has decided broke the game's "flow" or were simply "too far away". 


Getting around the game will be quicker too - as Battlefield adds the Polaris RZR buggy as an in-world vehicle. To my eyes, it looks like a cross between a tank and a golf cart. Why not?

In the last month we've had two big Marvel video game announcements, one being Uncharted director Amy Hennig's next title involving Captain America and an earlier incarnation of Black Panther in the second world war. And the more recent announcement being the Iron Man game coming from the EA owned Motive Studio. But don't place any bets on these characters meeting each other à la the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because Marvel has no plans for it.


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, Marvel executive Bill Rosemann made it clear that on the games front, everything would be a separate entity (thanks, Eurogamer). "The world is, amazingly, very familiar and accepting of the multiverse," Rosemann said. "We have all these different realities. Now they're all real, and we want to give everyone the freedom to tell their story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RuneScape, the popular MMORPG created by the lovely UK folk over at Jagex, has received its Fresh Start Worlds today, allowing players to jump in and start from scratch with a reset economy and all the unique quirks that aspect provides. Old School RuneScape players won’t have to wait too long either, as Fresh Start Worlds for that title are also due soon on October 19.
The reasons for grinding up a new character again? These Fresh Start Worlds come with unique cosmetic rewards including capes, halos, and other swanky gear. Set to last for a limited time, characters and loot obtained on these Fresh Start Worlds will later be transferred over to a core world with all their stuff. Great news for those who put in the time, but also the cause of some concern. We’ll touch on that later.
To access these Fresh Start Worlds, players will need to create a brand new account and purchase a fresh membership according to the official support website. This isn’t a burden to new players, who’ll be able to use these fresh servers as an opportunity to get in on the same level as others, but for existing RuneScape fans it’ll mean cashing out for a second subscription alongside their pre-existing account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Koei Tecmo's upcoming take on Monster Hunter is officially called Wild Hearts, and its first trailer is coming this week.

Last month, EA announced that it would be collaborating with Omega Force, the Koei Tecmo studio behind the Warriors series, through its EA Originals program to make a game it called "the next great hunting game," obviously implying it'll be something like Monster Hunter. That game now has a name - Wild Hearts - and this Wednesday, September 28, 3pm BST, we'll get a first look at it in its reveal trailer.


"Prepare for an epic adventure set in a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan," reads the trailer's simple description, so you'll have to wait until it's live before you find out any more. There is some kind of scary-looking dog included in the teaser post, presumably one of the beasts that you'll be hunting whenever the game does launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just finished Deathloop on Xbox Game Pass. You may have already seen that I quite liked it – it’s stylish, sassy, compelling, and brings you into its world with little faff. It’s a lean experience; nowhere near as complex and unwieldy as the Dishonored series. And it takes you nowhere near long to complete, either. I think I wrapped up the Colt/Julianna storyline in a nice, easy 20 hours. Time enough to chew on it, digest the bits I enjoyed, and move on (Beacon Pines, I’m coming for you next).

As I downloaded this next quick completion, I read in Play Magazine that the upcoming alternate history jaunt of A Plague Tale: Requiem will clock in at under 20 hours, with  Asobo Studio’s lead level designer Kevin Pinson noting that the game will run about 15-18 hours, depending on how you play, with ‘no filler content’ padding it out. As I read this, my internal monologue provokes that timeless Gordon Ramsey quote: “Finally, some good fucking food.”
I played A Plague Tale: Requiem at Gamescom, and I loved it. The way it combines stealth with tactical movement, light puzzling with the grim reality of surviving in a world inundated with the plague (oh, wait) all comes together in this tight, intentional game that knows exactly where it’s going. And how it wants to get there.

Their latest mod is Trombone Champ, the surprise Steam hit of last week.

Raicuparta shared a video of himself attempting Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in VR. The display inside the headset shows a first-person view of the titular Trombone Champ and the gameplay screen is projected in front of you. The game is played with motion controls, meaning you have to extend and retract your arm instead of moving a mouse back and forth for the correct notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fallout from Nvidia's RTX 4080/4090 reveal last week has been intense. We saw the reveal of the RTX 4090 - a phenomenal achievement in performance - backed by the debut of pioneering new technology like DLSS 3 frame generation, the remarkable RTX Remix and a new version of Cyberpunk 2077 that is to all intents and purposes running with full path-tracing. The technology is there to move PC gaming onto a new level but reaction to the keynote has instead been dominated by RTX 4080 pricing. Two RTX 4080s of very different spec levels are coming - priced at $899 and $1199 respectively - and based on reaction to Nvidia's own benchmarks, there's a performance gulf between them and an 'fps per dollar' deficit compared to prior gen-on-gen leaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a rumour for a while that Certain Affinity is working on a Halo Infinite battle royale, and the studio has recently promised that the project it is working on is "something big and new for the franchise."


Back in August of 2020, the Halo Infinite store page made a mention of a battle royale mode, and later that year a rumour emerged that suggested the game would in fact be receiving such a mode sometime in 2021. That obviously never happened, but frequent Halo assist studio Certain Affinity is working on something to do with Halo Infinite, and there are plenty of rumours that that is where the battle royale mode is being developed. And now, Certain Affinity executive Paul Sams has somewhat teased the project (thanks, Eurogamer).


"The biggest thing we're doing that's public right now, for more than two years now we've been working on Halo Infinite doing something that - they're very prescriptive about what we can say," Sams told VentureBeat. "But we're doing something unannounced, and we're doing lead development on that unannounced thing, from conception and design.

That’s a pretty big deal for a show that ran relatively unhindered for almost a quarter of a century. New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they're this site’s parent organisation.

Next year will see the LACC's two main halls divided into separate spaces for industry attendees and those attending as fans - similar to how the various halls are separated at Gamescom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Yakuza spin-off Judgment and of Japanese actors who’ve been naughty will be pleased to hear that there’s a mod to restore the voice and likeness of Pierre Taki to the game. Taki-san's performance as character Kyohei Hamura was removed from the Japanese version of Judgment after he was arrested for possession and use of cocaine in 2019, never making it to the West. Now, the Judgment Pierre Taki Restoration Patch finally brings the scrubbed actor back for the very first time, over here at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ever-expanding world of Assassin's Creed Valhalla will receive one of its final major updates tomorrow, as it adds a final set of puzzle tombs via patch 1.6.1. 


This activity was originally added to the game earlier this year, and adds a new storyline expanding upon the series' mysterious precursor Isu race, doled out by exploring a string of fun puzzle dungeons. 


It also allows for Eivor to come face-to-face with a series of British figures from history before her time - such as the ancient queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Fans have some interesting theories on who may pop up in this concluding set of dungeons (including someone perhaps more from Assassin's Creed lore than actual history itself).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is following the long tradition of difficult games not having any difficulty options.


It's a tale as old as time by this point, but difficult games, whether they be Dark Souls, Nioh, or an indie trying its own thing, often don't have any kind of difficulty options. Which isn't even touching on the related but separate issue of accessibility options. And now, Wo Long's producer Masaaki Yamagiwa has explained the decision behind not having any difficulty options in a recent interview.


Speaking to MP1st, Yamagiwa said "We're thinking it's 'good' to have one set difficulty so that everyone has the same experience of overcoming a really intense obstacle and they all have that feeling of achievement, like I did it. But the caveat there is giving players all different ways that they can do that."

Sable: Design Works will be the first instalment from publisher Lost in Cult's new series of indie-focussed art books. This particular release, which is due to launch in the second quarter of 2023, will feature interviews from those at developer Shedworks, as well as a "region-by-region insight" into the world of Midden and its art.


The book itself will be split into two different sections, one that "charts the development of Sable from its early concept and prototype, through its production, to launch" and one that focuses exclusively on the artwork and visuals.

But rather going for a 512-bit FPU data path and the possibility of reduced clock frequencies and power/thermal concerns, they employed a 256-bit "double pumping" strategy. When getting the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in the lab, exploring the AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 performance was one of the areas I was most excited to evaluate. From the benchmarks about to be shown, AMD's initial AVX-512 implementation is promising and has me all the more excited for finding it on AMD EPYC "Genoa" processors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 7000 processors are here, with a new 5nm process node and AM5 socket unlocking higher clock frequencies, greater power usage and in turn better performance. The four new CPUs releasing on September 27th also include a new 6nm I/O die, integrated graphics and support for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 - it's a substantial feature upgrade that reclaims parity with Intel's 12th-gen CPUs. 
Of course, features often come second to fps, so performance testing has comprised the bulk of our efforts. So far, two chips have crossed our desks - the $549/£579 Ryzen 9 7900X and $299/£319 Ryzen 5 7600X - and we've put them up against our assortment of hand-picked games and a sprinkling of productivity benchmarks too. The question we want to answer is simple: how do these Zen 4 designs perform against Intel's 12th-gen Core counterparts and AMD's older Ryzen 5000 lineup? 
The move to DDR5 also brings up a secondary question - what's the current RAM sweet spot for price/performance with Ryzen 7000? AMD suggest in their documentation that DDR5-6000 is the ideal right now, so we've tested their CPUs - and Intel's closest equivalents - at both 6000MT/s (AMD's recommendation) and 5200MT/s (where we did our Intel 12th-gen testing).

You know; those teeny, tiny little red bugs that could line-dance on a head of a pin and scurry along paving stones, looking like they couldn't hurt anything? Yeah. One of those. Emphasis on the "one", too, as this lad had been alone. And yet he'd taken one look at my sassy side ponytail and (correctly) presumed I was an easy target. Was it unexpected? You bet. Scary? Surprisingly so. Embarrassing? Yes. Very. 


Given I'm still on Day One of my survival journey I'd been hoping for a gentle tutorial period, but this bad boy had barrelled towards me, focused and unflinching, like a toddler locks onto a ball pit. A single thought flickers through my head: if these are the early enemies, what the hell are the strong ones like?!


The second time I cark it, I died of thirst. It wasn't that I ignored the instruction to get something to drink as much as I was distracted by the glorious wilderness – well, if you can call a suburban backyard the wilderness – and I didn't realise until the sun went down that I was missing the sap required to rustle up a torch. So, instead of creating a Lean To and hunkering down for the night, I huddled beneath the Kid Case spawn point instead – hotly aware of every slither and scuttle around me – and slowly expired of acute dehydration. Turns out that was more embarrassing than being walloped to death by the mite.

Now, Certain Affinity exec Paul Sams has said the studio's still-technically-unannounced project had been in the works for more than two years, with almost 100 staff working on it.

Front and centre was the Island Sanctuary: a farming life sim mode that offers a relaxing alternative to dungeon battling through duties and raids. That was on top of more main scenario and side quests, treasure hunts, housing options, and an extension of the Duty Support feature that lets players quest alone.


All of this variety is in line with producer and director Naoki Yoshida's idea of the ultimate MMORPG.

Marvel exec Bill Rosemann set the record straight as part of a GamesIndustry.biz interview, which comes after a succession of announcements for upcoming Iron Man, Black Panther and Wolverine  games.


"The world is, amazingly, very familiar and accepting of the multiverse," Rosemann said. "We have all these different realities. Now they're all real, and we want to give everyone the freedom to tell their story.

The unamed teen has been charged with two counts of computer misuse, as well as two counts of breaching bail conditions. 


These latter charges likely refer to the teen's previous run-in with police over hacking charges - when they were suspected of breaching both Microsoft and Samsung earlier in the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When developer Telltale Games launched the first season of its acclaimed and enormously influential The Walking Dead adaptation in 2012, it hit upon a choice-driven narrative formula the studio would rigidly adhere to across every one of its titles until its sad closure in 2018. Some found masterful ways to adapt that increasingly well-worn template, others were merely okay, but none were perhaps as odd, memorable, and quietly beloved as Tales from the Borderlands.


Tales from the Borderlands seemed like a bizarre, if not outright doomed, proposition from the off, attempting to marry Telltale's rich, character-driven formula to a puerile, open-ended looter shooter best known for its oodles of procedural guns. But against all the odds, it worked sublimely, the team at Telltale using the Borderlands series' loosely sketched canvas to deliver an experience that, for many who played it, proved to be not only the best Borderlands game, but Telltale's finest work - a five-part adventure that, largely free from the shackles of continuity and expectation, gleefully experimented with form and structure, melding dizzying invention and anarchic, unabashed silliness to something with surprising warmth and emotion.


And now, some eight years later, original Borderlands developer Gearbox is attempting to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of Tales from the Borderlands all over again.

Ikea - the shop that takes you through a convoluted one-way system as you see mock-ups of rooms full of all you could ever need for your own home, and then before you know it you have purchased 100 tealights and a packet of meatballs.


But what if you were to throw a load of zombie-like monsters into this experience, and then proceed to turn out the lights, leaving the exit near impossible to find? Well, one developer has decided to answer that question in its upcoming game: The Store is closed.


The Store is Closed is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games' The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy (thanks, PCGamesN).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Potion Permit doesn't seem to do anything in a hurry, and that's because it's a game that expects you to be with it for a long time to come. It's a life simulation, really, dressed up as a potion making game. You're a chemist sent to a town to brew potions, but here's a house to decorate and machines to renovate, and here are townsfolk whose friendships you'll have to earn before they - and the services they offer - open up. Oh, and they have daily rhythms you'll have to adapt to and work around. Try and catch someone out of hours and they won't want to know: you'll have to wait until morning when they're officially on duty again. It all takes time.


The game unfolds mechanically in a very similar way, introducing new ideas slowly. After a couple of hours' play, I've only seen a few of what I suspect will be many gameplay ideas overall, and most of them mini-games. But the core idea is resource-gathering and crafting. 


When you're in the wilds, Potion Permit feels like an old-school action RPG, in that you hit enemies with a button-press and then roll around to dodge their attacks. You don't have to kill enemies - combat doesn't seem to be the point of the game - but you'll be attacked and enemies drop useful ingredients, so why not?

The sftp server runs using

Nier: Automata Ver1.1a (because it wouldn't be a Nier piece of media if it didn't have some kind of weird name) received a lengthy trailer yesterday (September 24) showing off the anime in action for the first time, and even featured since insider details from Yoko Taro and the anime's director Ryoji Masayuma. It also confirmed a release date for the anime, which will be available to watch January 2023.


The trailer doesn't show off too much of the anime itself, but we do get to see what looks to be some of the early scenes of the game, which has a strong early 2000s vibe to the style.

The new initiative, entitled Screen Culture 2033, will "advocate for the value of the full breadth of screen culture, including video games and interactive work".

Describing screen culture as "young, dynamic and expanding", the BFI says "it presents a wider screen landscape that encompasses film, television, digital media, extended reality (XR) and video games" and says "it has become the dominant means of communication, information and storytelling for Gen Z and beyond".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a recent report that discussed AI led voice acting, Hellblade developer Ninja Theory has clarified that it has no intentions to stop using real voice actors.


GLHF recently ran a report on AI voice acting, and how voice actors are concerned about losing their jobs to the technology. The piece in part focused on one such company working on this tech called Altered AI, and noted how Ninja Theory, currently working on Hellblade 2: Senua's Saga, is working with Altered AI, leading some to be concerned that the studio is replacing actual actors with AI. But Ninja Theory has put any of these concerns to bed with a recent tweet.


"No. For clarity, we use this AI tech for placeholder content only to help us understand things like timing and placement in early phases of development," wrote Ninja Theory in response to a Twitter user asking if the studio was in fact replacing real voice actors with AI. "We then collaborate with real actors whose performances are at the heart of bringing our stories to life."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new PC mod is replacing the face and voice of a Judgment character whose original likeness was unceremoniously pulled several years ago following a drugs arrest.

Originally, the character model and voice for Judgement character Kyohei Hamura was based upon Japanese musician and actor Pierre Taki. Shortly after his drugs arrest, however, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios scrambled to replace him with the voice and likeness of Japanese actor Miou Tanaka instead.

Modder Timo 654, however, has brought Taki back to life - so to speak - by meticulously restoring the original voice lines and likeness.

Whilst we've yet to hear of a definitive date, creator Yoko Taro was at least able to confirm the release window during Aniplex Online Fest, which took place over the weekend.

Interestingly, Taro also revealed that due to the differences between storytelling via games and traditional mediums - and despite Aniplex's hopes of a faithful retelling of the game - the anime's story will differ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent job listing at Ubisoft seems to suggest that the Splinter Cell remake is being written with modern audiences in mind.


Last year, Ubisoft announced that a remake of the original Splinter Cell is in development, coming from the studio that developed Far Cry 6. Nothing has really been revealed since then, as is often par for the course when it comes to video game announcements. But as spotted by PlayStation Universe, we have more of an idea of how the game will be different from the original thanks to a recent scriptwriter job listing.


"Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience," reads the listing's description. "We want to keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable. As a scriptwriter at Ubisoft Toronto, you will join the narrative team and help create a cohesive and compelling narrative experience for a new audience of Splinter Cell fans."

According to SteamDB, the beta is currently sporting more concurrent players than Team Fortress 2, Destiny 2, GTA 5, and even Cyberpunk 2077, which has seen a boost in its own player numbers recently, too. 

With an all-time concurrent peak of 168,330 players (at the time of writing, anyway; it's been increasing steadily all weekend), that means it's already beaten the concurrent records for games like Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, The Division, FIFA 22, and Borderlands 2.

Plenty of games require you to do multiple playthroughs to see all of the story, and it sounds like Gotham Knights is no different. In a recent interview with PLAY magazine (as shared by MP1st), the game's director Geoff Ellenor explained how it is that you'll be able to see different parts of the story.


"You will not see all of it in a single playthrough," explained Ellenor, continuing to say "just because there’s so much content that is unique to the hero’s perception of what’s going on and what happened." Obviously Ellenor is referring to the fact that in Gotham Knights you can play as either Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood, or Robin, so it isn't too surprising to hear that each character will view things slightly differently.

Sorry to say that the words 'Sly Cooper' and 'announcement' aren't being paired together to reveal a surprise new title, but with the game's 20th anniversary having taken place on September 23, Sucker Punch did have some merch to show off, including a print, a t-shirt, and a plush of everyone's favourite sneaky raccoon.


The print is admittedly incredibly gorgeous, showing a cross section of a building with a tonne of wonderful details and references to the series. At the time of writing both  versions of the framed print are currently out of stock on the producer's website (Cook & Becker), as there were a limited number that were signed by artist Dev Madan, but it might be worth keeping an eye on anyway. But it is still available to pick up on the PlayStation Gear store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 looks to be doing pretty well for itself, as the game's player count on Steam has risen quickly following the release of Cyberpunk Edgerunners.


We probably all know by now that Cyberpunk 2077 didn't exactly launch in an amazing state. Whether it was the glitches, or the much delayed current-gen version of the game, things didn't really pan out until this year when the game actually saw a number of big fixes, and the current-gen version was actually released. Despite all of its problems though, at the time of writing Cyberpunk is sitting at a healthy 105,445 concurrent players (via SteamDB). Why? Through the power of anime, of course.


Cyberpunk Edgerunners, the anime spinoff of CD Projekt's take on the franchise from everyone's favourite Studio Trigger, launched last week, and has so far been pretty widely praised. And clearly fans have the Cyberpunk fever, because since the release of the anime, the average player count has been going up and up and up, hitting a peak of 122,376 players yesterday (September 24), which as PCGamesN points out is higher than The Witcher 3's all time Steam peak of 103,329.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following "reports of an issue with online servers". Although the publisher described the situation as "temporary", it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3's servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said "there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform" and revealed that it was "investigating the source of the problem", but the servers remained offline for several days.

        <updated>2022-09-25T11:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had no idea how important shareware was, and arguably still is, to the gaming industry until today. To me, shareware represented the few games I managed to play for free throughout the '90s. In particular, Duke Nukem 3D at lunchtime at Rupert Loman's house. (Rupert is the founder of Eurogamer/Gamer Network.) And there, in the corner of our screens, would be the little shareware reminder that we were playing an unregistered version of the game. But that wasn't a problem, it was legit, it wasn't pirated. We could keep playing for as long as we wanted. It's just that if we wanted more levels than the opening one, around the cinema - with the toilets you could wee into and the mirrors that actually reflected you (wow!) - then we'd have to pay for it. And I don't think any of us ever did.


But that was shareware: finding stuff for free. Or, at least, that's what it represented to me - I now realise I might have been part of the problem. But I was a teenager! I was broke. That's why I got sucked into Dope Wars with all of my other MSN Messenger buddies in 1998, buying and selling drugs at very competitive market prices (in a game!), and how I found an RPG called Dink Smallwood, which I remember vividly to this day. Does anyone else? I'm genuinely curious.


Really, though, shareware began a long, long time ago, though it can still be seen today (whisper it: "freemium"). And I learnt this from a new book called Shareware Heroes, written by Richard Moss. It attempts the daunting task of presenting a history of shareware by telling the stories of all the people involved in it. That's the equivalent of trying to follow all the separate threads in a bowl of spaghetti. But Moss, admirably, manages it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if you remember that Detective Pikachu was even getting another game, but it is, and it looks like it not only still exists, but might even be out soon.


The original Detective Pikachu game for 3DS, the inspiration behind the 2019 film of the same name, was announced to be receiving a sequel for Switch shortly after the film came out. And then we just… have not heard a single thing about the sequel since. But an eagle-eyed user on Famiboards noticed a mention of the game on developer Johnathon Murphy's LinkedIn page which suggests the game might not be too far off.


Famiboards user MetalLord shared a screenshot of Murphy's LinkedIn page, a developer who's been with Creatures Inc. since 2017 as a senior programer, a company that basically made all your favourite Pokémon spinoffs, and helps out on the main games. "Using Unity/C#, worked on one unannounced project and one nearing release, Detective Pikachu 2," reads the section of Murphy's experience at Creatures Inc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're finally going to get our first taste of the Super Mario Bros. film next month, as a teaser trailer is planned to premiere at New York Comic Con.


The official NYCC Twitter account announced earlier this week that the first teaser trailer for Nintendo and Illumination's Super Mario Bros. would be shown off at the convention, October 6, 4pm EST. It also finally confirmed a release date of April 7, 2023, as it had previously only been confirmed for a Spring release, after having been delayed from the holiday season this year.


Paired with the announcement is a very simple poster showing the classic question mark block on a black background, providing an elegance that Mario is perhaps not deserving of. No other details were given about the teaser trailer, and the announcement certainly didn't mention if we're going to hear the voice of Mario himself, Chris Pratt.

This would be more of a short post about the current book I am reading. Now people who have seen Arrival would probably be more at home. People who have also seen Avatar would also be familiar to the theme or concept I am sharing about. Now before I go into detail, it seems that Arthur C. Clarke wanted to use a powerful god or mythological character for the name and that is somehow the RAMA series started.
Now the first book in the series explores an extraterrestrial spaceship that earth people see/connect with. The spaceship is going somewhere and is doing an Earth flyby so humans don’t have much time to explore the spaceship and it is difficult to figure out how the spaceship worked. The spaceship is around 40 km. long. They don’t meet any living Ramans but mostly automated syste…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Renting games as a kid was frequently the only way I could play many new games. I was lucky that I'd typically receive a game for my birthday and for Christmas, but the rest of the year, games were expensive and out of reach through any other method than renting. It was the 1990s and the idea of cheap digital downloads to stave off the lack of games seemed unfathomable. 


The advantage to renting games is I had the opportunity to experience many more games than I ever would have risked asking for as a gift. The disadvantage? The competition involved in acquiring the game I was after.


That was the case with not-quite-Zelda-clone-but-it-is-basically Story of Thor on the Mega Drive. In many ways, competing for a copy of Story of Thor, also known as Beyond Oasis, was harder than actually playing the game. My local Blockbuster (remember those? No? Oh) had two copies. It looked thrilling. It had one of those newer Mega Drive boxes that had a thick blue line down the side of it. On the one hand, that meant that the game would have superior graphics and other bits and pieces. On the other hand, that meant the Mega Drive was getting a bit long in the tooth and my days of owning the latest console were very numbered. To put it into context, in Europe, Story of Thor came out the same year as the PlayStation 1 launched. Change was coming. Fast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article originally went out to Eurogamer supporters as part of the Eurogamer Essentials newsletter that goes to all members every Friday. If you'd like to find out how to become a Eurogamer supporter you can find out more here.

If' there's anything as fascinating is the incubation of a triple-A game - something exposed in spectacular fashion last weekend by the GTA 6 drama, with leaks that stripped away the gloss and exposed the wheels and cogs (as well as the ignorance of how exactly video games are made, something we could all do a better job of educating each other on) - it's the afterlife of a modern-day blockbuster. Even better when it's one as derided as Cyberpunk 2077 was at launch. 
Why exactly CD Projekt's sci-fi spectacular was the subject of such ire when it launched at the tail-end of 2020 is a topic too multifaceted to properly unpick with the 600 or so words we have here; there was some righteous anger about the appalling working conditions Cyberpunk 2077 was made under at times, a hype cycle that even the most accomplished of games would buckle under, a more than messy launch as it awkwardly straddled two generations of hardware and, ultimately, a good old-fashioned pile-on that obscured all else. There’s rarely room for nuance in internet discourse, and the noise around Cyberpunk 2077’s launch is proof perfect of that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life can be a lot less bother when you hover. Think of Exile, the 1988 marvel that cleverly crams an entire alien world and its belligerent fauna into the scrawny 32k memory of a BBC Micro. Chief among the game's chaotic pleasures is its nifty jetpack, empowering your stranded space captain to explore the hostile planet Phoebus and its clever tangle of interlocking physics systems. 
As modes of transport go, jetpacks are often more about pluck than precision. In Exile you are engaged in a constant push-pull with unhelpful gas geysers, explosive shockwaves and the invisible tug of Phoebus gravity. But rocketing around at high speed in low-roofed caverns chimes perfectly with a game that asks you to jump headfirst into the unknown and apply seat-of-the-pants problem-solving. Exile's rocket-powered emergent slapstick makes me smile the same way I do when seeing a jelly start to wobble: precariousness as pleasure. It is undoubtedly my second-favourite video game jetpack. (In keeping with the subject matter, please strap in and allow me to loop around in some discursive aerobatics before revealing my actual favourite.)
It is a boost universally acknowledged, then: jetpacks rule. They have ruled since the early 20th century, when they first propelled space cowboys like Buck Rogers into high adventure via lowbrow pulp novels and comic strips. For decades these portable domesticated explosions were sleek symbols of a seemingly imminent tech-assisted future, gleaming pointers toward a world where humanity would be free to blast off at will into the Y-axis while flicking V-signs at boring old gravity.

Chat about the weather might seem trite but what other conversation topic covers matters directly impacting your life today without risking causing a disagreement, years of simmering resentment, or a brawl? "What are you having for dinner?" is another good one, I think. Perhaps you'll find this advice helpful if you're attending EGX this weekend. Oh, I know another one: what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deathloop has finally appeared on Xbox Series consoles. The time-travelling caper from Microsoft-owned Arkane Studios debuted as a PS5 and PC release last September - a time-limited console exclusive owing to a pre-acquisition agreement with Sony. That original PS5 release had some flaws but has been patched since release with additional content, visual fixes, and a new 120fps graphics mode. But with a fresh start on new consoles, has Arkane finally delivered a properly calibrated version of their first-person adventure? Is this the definitive Deathloop experience? 


Deathloop is a curious game. Like many prior Arkane titles, it's superficially a first-person action game, but success depends on exploiting unique character abilities, stealth, and environmental hazards. It offers open-end…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don't usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it's a fun silly idea; 2) it's very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It's a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn't frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 17 year old was arrested in Oxfordshire yesterday, due to the suspicions of hacking. According to journalist Matthew Keys and sources who spoke to them, they were allegedly involved in the GTA 6 hack that resulted in a major information leak last weekend, and are also connected to a prior hack on Uber. This source also claims that the arrest was made by London City police in collaboration with the FBI.
In terms of information that has been confirmed, the London City Police has come forward and announced an arrest has been made in Oxfordshire as part of an ivnestigation by the NCA UK's National Cyber Crime Unit. Currently in police custody, there is currently no confirmation made by the police whether they were arrested for the GTA 6 hack, although according to journalist Matthew keys an additional statement by the London City Police will be released later today. A statement from the FBI may also be released soon.
The hacker responsible for the GTA 6 had earlier in the week publicised that they were looking to make a "deal" with Rockstar (thanks Gamebyte), but since then things have gone quiet. Rockstar Games did come out to confirm that the leaked assets were legitimate, leading to an influx of industry support and numerious other devs posting their own early game builds to show that the GTA 6 that the world could see thanks to the leaks wasn't likely to resemble the final product.

think in time of Debian General Resolutions (GRs). And even if we
didn’t, vote lists were open (except when voting for people,
i.e. when electing a DPL), so if interested we could understand what
our different peers thought.
This is the first vote, though, where a Debian vote is protected under
voting secrecy. I think
it is sad we chose that path, as I liken a GR vote more with a voting
process within a general assembly of a cooperative than with a
countrywide voting one; I feel that understanding who is behind each
posture helps us better understand the project as a whole.

The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While everyone knows that Classic World of Warcraft is undergoing a heap of hype surrounding the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, for good reason too, there are plenty of reasons to get excited, Brewfest is a great opportunity for loot and laughs right now. It is, however, also an opportunity for cheeky people to try and scam some extra loot from under the noses of their fellow adventurer. Such are the joys of Classic WoW.
But first, what is Brewfest. For those not in the know, Brewfest is a one-per-year limited time event where players can buy some drinks, get smashes, and get some exclusive rewards. It’s unsubtly based on the German holiday Octoberfest, and features a variety of events and tasks for players to complete if they so wish.
It also has a special boss fight — Corren Direbrew — in the Blackrock Depths, which in turn can provide some truly illustrious loot. These could be powerful trinkets, special toys that allow quick transfer to the dungeon, and even two very rare mounts with roughly a 1% drop-rate from Corren. Since right now players are gearing up characters for the next expansion, an even greater number of players than usual are jumping in for a chance at some handy shinies in this already bustling activity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post I introduced yet another Lisp interpreter.  When it was posted there was no support for macros.
Since I've recently returned from a visit to the UK, and caught COVID-19 while I was there, I figured I'd see if my brain was fried by adding macro support.
I know lisp macros are awesome, it's one of those things that everybody is told.  Repeatedly.    I've used macros in my emacs programming off and on for a good few years, but despite that I'd not really given them too much thought.
If you know anything about lisp you know that it's all about the lists, the parenthesis, and the macros.  Here's a simple macro I wrote:
 (define if2 (macro (pred one two)
    `(if ~pred (begin ~one ~two))))

The standard lisp if function allows you to write:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the 16 and 64-bit eras, UK-based developer Rare was exceptionally good at looking at what its then almost-parent Nintendo was doing, then developing their own killer take on it. I mean, seriously, look at the evidence – Diddy Kong Racing gives Mario Kart 64 a run for its money, but is awash with way, way more content. Banjo Kazooie is right up there with Super Mario 64. And one of the great pieces of gaming gossip of the 90s revolves around Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto’s alleged distaste at the wild success of Donkey Kong Country. Rare and Nintendo were on the same side, but were in a quiet sort of rivalry that resulted in some really damn good games. 

Star Fox Adventures is another game in that pantheon – and as I reconsidered this unique little tile as it turns 20 years old, I realized two things: first, the march of time is crushing and I feel ancient. Second: this is sadly the last great Star Fox game, at least for now.
Which is funny when you think about it, as Star Fox Adventures didn’t even begin life as a Star Fox game. It was originally announced as Dinosaur Planet, an original Rare property that was basically the company doing for the Ocarina of Time formula what Banjo-Kazooie did to Mario 64’s take on 3D platforming. It starred dual protagonists, a fox and a wolf, but after Miyamoto saw the game in action, he made a suggestion: why didn’t it just use Star Fox? Thus the game changed forms, and then platform – jumping from a surprisingly complete N64 build to a massive do-over on GameCube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week's offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn't Ark: Survival Evolved's first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you're a survival fan who hasn't yet given it a look, it's still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark's base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic's freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game's rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

When your child smiles at you for the first time and it isn't a build up of gas... wonderful. When your child says "dada" not as part of a string of completely random sounds... wonderful. When your child laughs at you for doing something only they would laugh at... wonderful.
As I said, it's not always wonderful. Waking up four times a night... not wonderful. Standing in a stress position to hold the hands of a tiny child trying to walk... not wonderful (but also wonderful). Constantly tidying things that are never actually tidy... not wonderful.
But if there's one thing that sums up having young children it's this: It's 4pm on a Saturday. Essentially the evening if you're a parent. It's a little too early for dinner, but you at least know that that's soon and then after that bed time isn't far off. The sweet release of bed time. Anyway, you see a crumb of chocolate just sat in a crevice of your shirt. Given that dinner, as established is still some minutes away, you fancy a small snack. Yum! Chocolate. But you've forgotten, just for a split-second, that you have a baby.

With awesome animation and key aesthetic twinkles that ground the action in the Cyberpunk universe, there’s enough for newcomers to drink in while also letting franchise devotees nod sagely along to the show feeling very clever as it ticks off the all the cool things they’ve seen in-game – now that’s fan service. 


If adapting something beloved is difficult, then adapting something with a dodgy rep should be even harder.


For all its genuine merits, Cyberpunk 2077 overpromised, launched in an unacceptable state on console and bore the price – even my Mum asked me about it getting yanked from PlayStation after she heard about it on mainstream breakfast news.

Let's rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has finally released a shiny new revamp of their old stats page, so that us data nerds can track the most popular, most financially lucrative, and most played PC games on Steam in one new webpage. Available for anyone and everyone right now, you no longer have to check out a dated site or third party alternatives.
Announced via a blog post earlier today, a variety of info on each game and their placement on respective rankings such as recent changes in position, options to quickly switch regional toggles, and the ability to see total revenue. All in all, a handy tool!
Those who have been around for a while, and people who have tried to look up this sort of information may have popped by the old stats page or websites like Steam Spy or Steam Charts (yes, there was a Steam Charts before this announcement, confusingly enough). It was possible to get a good idea of certain data points via these websites (some of which would pull information from the Steam API) That being said, having a new flashy place to grab this kind of data from an official source does make the process a whole lot easier.

I wasn’t planning to focus so much on Shadows of Doubt, and I will be doing a proper preview in the coming weeks, but I cannot stress this enough – it’s brilliant. Rarely does such a bold vision enjoy being matched by its execution. It reminds me somewhat of Cloudpunk, which I really enjoyed, but I desperately wanted to have a less passive relationship with the city itself. With it’s striking sense of immersion and a commitment to granular interactivity built into the game’s core design, I feel like Shadows of Doubt very much achieves that aspiration for me. I can’t wait until the full version comes out next year. It won ‘UK Game of the Show’ at Gamescom a few weeks ago, and it’s blindingly obvious why …]]></summary>

The FPS is currently only playable on PC, but the Hyenas team have said that’s set to change in the near future.

Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


"Neil Druckmann?" my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

There's nothing quite like a two-player board game to stoke the fires of competition. Two-player board games are great in that they offer the kind of uniquely competitive experience that no other type of tabletop title can provide - and Sobek: 2 Players is a prime example of this.  
A recent remake/reimagining of a 2010 card game, Sobek: 2 Players takes the concept of the original – players are merchants attempting to make a tidy profit in an Ancient Egyptian market – and turns it into a more focused version, ditching the two to four-player count for a one-on-one experience.

It's only available for those who pre-ordered or acquired a beta code so far, but it's already breaking records.
Everyone assumed it was going to be big, but since Call of Duty has been absent from Steam for five years now, we never really had a good picture of its player numbers on PC. Modern Warfare 2 marks the series' grand return to Steam, and the audience there has responded in kind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase's plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It's in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an 'isometric/top-down' perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google's Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can't be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do "love exploring". The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft Classic is getting a massive update with the Wrath of the Lich King expansion on September 26. It’s a bit of a big deal, especially for the thousands of players who have been grinding out Alterac Valley or farming professions over the past few weeks. To celebrate the occasion, a new trailer has been released on the official World of Warcraft Youtube channel, and it’s absolutely perfect.
You can watch it yourself below, but for some context this wasn’t created by the usual team of talented CGI artists who put out stunning cinematics for expansions (like the excellent Dragon Isle trailer). Instead, it comes from fan creator Hurricane, who has previously been responsible for a range of custom mind-blowing raid trailers.
In the trailer, you can see all the major features of the Wrath of the Lich King launch, including the scourge invasion of Azeroth, players arriving to the various Northrend zones and battling various monsters you can find there, taking on dungeons and of course some Wintergrasp PvP. All of this is a machinima, made with a variety of in-game assets and custom VFX. For an idea of the sort of work that goes into trailers like this, you can check out a short breakdown video of a previous Black Temple trailer here!

The initial leaker is known as Teapot and used the account @teapotuberhacker, but the forum believes another user, with the moniker Lily, also had access to this account.


It’s unclear whether this second user has access to any hacked material, though the forum believes this is not the case.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, 
here's our archive.
I haven't laughed so hard at a game in a long time. Trombone Champ is hilarious. It's everything the legendary melodica cover of the Jurassic Park theme tune is and more. And it's hard enough trying to play it without struggling to breathe while laughing. This is rhythm action comedy at its finest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we're discussing video game leaks, following last weekend's devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2's five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the "epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour". Here, they'll find "challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover."


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

The demonic turn-based experience is coming back for modern gamers, and it's got a new developer attached this time around – it's been reimagined by Armello creators, League of Geeks, and will arrive complete with all-new single-player scenarios and scheme-in-your-sleep asynchronous multiplayer matches, to boot.

As with the original release, the new game will require you to deploy cunning moves and political wit in order to outplay your opponents and reign supreme. The game has been modernized and built in 3D with a totally updated visual interface, bringing in the lessons League of Geeks has learned from Armello when it comes to "unique and acclaimed aesthetic and production values".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC players are rushing to find ways to download a popular Grand Theft Auto 4 mod compilation after it was taken down following a copyright infringement notice to the hosting site which provided access to the project. 


Grand Theft Auto IV - Definitive Edition is a project which complied a number of mods which aimed to enhance and update the game to run on modern PCs (thanks, PC Gamer). 


The game was last updated by Rockstar in 2020, when the developer removed the archaic Games for Windows Live DRM after it was shut down by Microsoft. However, this also had the unfortunate effect of disabling access to online multiplayer and leaderboards, which were run through the GFWL backend.

The post goes on to state that Ubisoft intends to "keep the spirit and themes of the original game" with this remake while "exploring [its] characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable."

        <link href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-innocn-40c1r-review-flat-40-inch-gaming-monitor"/>
        <updated>2022-09-22T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Innocn 40C1R is a 40-inch ultrawide monitor with an IPS-style panel, AMD Freesync Premium and a 144Hz refresh rate - all standard stuff, right? What makes this monitor unique though is its form factor: the 40C1R is completely flat, making it a tempting alternative for folks that don't appreciate the curved screens endemic amongst modern ultrawides. You don't pay a premium for this either, with the 40C1R being surprisingly affordable given its titanic proportions: $600 is the list price, with the price dipping to $480 or less during sales. 
I first ran into Innocn earlier this year, when I sampled one of their portable OLED monitors - which I felt delivered a nice combination of portability and image quality with all the benefits of OLED technology. The 40C1R is not an OLED display and I'm not a huge fan of LCD technology, so I was skeptical, but I figured I'd see how it stacks up against my own similarly-sized LG 38GN950 monitor and whether it's a suitable choice for PC gamers looking for a sizable panel at a decent price. 
Once you unbox the 40C1R, the first thing that stands out is the understated design. Devoid of the typical ostentatious gaming-oriented elements so common in PC monitors, the 40C1R is restrained with a modest, thin black bezel, a clean rectangular stand and a small lip running along the bottom of the frame housing the controls. It's a nice-looking monitor that'll look good on just about any desk - well, any desk that can handle its girth, at least.

If you're yet to try it, Spiritfarer is a memorable and moving adventure game where you shepard a crew of lost souls into the after life, while slowly upgrading your boat.


In a nutshell, it's a "cosy management game about dying", and one of my favourite games from 2020. If this news means more people get to play it - all the better!

The screenshot reel from a pre-release build of the game was found in the long-sought after 1996 Nintendo Company Report. 


The report, which has been carefully scanned and uploaded here, includes the standard yearly company round-up, plus some accompanying images of Nintendo's star roster and various consoles including the Nintendo 64 and the destined for failure Virtual Boy.

Ahead of these releases, its developer has shared some behind the scenes titbits about the game's manual, including how a real one was made to ensure authenticity within the game


Sharing on the PlayStation Blog, Tunic's lead developer Andrew Shouldice expressed his love for old-school game's manuals. "The more I thought about it though, the more I realised that my love for this kind of mystery came not just from the games, but from the manuals they were packaged with," Shouldice wrote, stating he would "pore over these documents endlessly".


Such was Shouldice's love for these manuals, he decided to incorporate one into Tunic's gameplay. In this case, the player picks up pages for the manual as they make their way through the game's mysterious word. These are then pieced together, allowing the player to uncover more of Tunic's many (many) secrets.

We know very little about the next game from official channels, but the huge leak on Monday gave us our biggest (albeit unfinished) look at the title. 


Moreover, with various reports reporting on the game's location, characters and gameplay elements, there appears to be enough to go on to start the mapping process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Return to Monkey Island has a lot of tricks up its sleeve. The greatest trick it manages to play, however, is to pick up where Monkey Island 2 left off, 30 years prior, and do so while feeling entirely natural. Not a beat is missed, not a shred of strange discomfort. It just works. Older players will slide into this game’s embrace like an old, battered sofa. And it feels like home.

It has other tricks, however. Return to Monkey Island isn’t the third Monkey Island game in truth, of course – but it’s the third from series creator Ron Gilbert. Return has things to say about the canon of the series, given this presents itself as the third Monkey Island game despite being the sixth to actually hit store shelves.
There’s a neat subtext throughout about what stories really mean to us all. The decades between Monkey Island 2 and this new story has clearly given Gilbert time to reflect on the originals, the games which are likely to headline his epitaph regardless of what he does in the future – and the end result is fascinating and heartening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Secret Fountain levels, I fell in love with the water. I didn't notice it at first. I was just digging downwards, flattening baddies with my shovel, enjoying the regular knockabout fun of a 2D platformer. But then I started getting hit by fish. Quite a lot of fish. Fish from the fish cannon, scarlet and slappy and properly doing me in. I realised that the fish moved across the water - they could travel wherever it flowed. And I realised that I could break blocks and channel the water where I wanted it to go. Maybe I could do more than just reroute the fish? What would happen if I steered the water over to that promising waterwheel?


Shovel Knight Dig is a fresh spin on the Shovel Knight series of Duck Tales-inspired platformers. Like Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, it's sort of a sidestory. Pocket Dungeon turned the action-heavy core of the games into a block puzzler. Dig initially seems like a blend of Mr Driller and Downwell. You dig down through soil and rock, collecting gems, fighting baddies, travelling through themed worlds. Classic Driller/Downwell stuff. Thing is, it doesn't feel like either game,


That's because while Dig is a Shovel Knight game and a Yacht Club game, it's also a Nitrome game - it's a true collaboration. And here a little history is unavoidable. Nitrome is an English micro-studio founded in the early 2000s, and I first encountered the team's stuff during the Flash/web-game boom in the years that followed. Nitrome was hard to miss: it delivered games that had a pixelart hard candy exterior - lots of hot pinks and mustards and purples. More importantly its games were marked by wild invention and polish.

At the top end, the RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1599. The RTX 4080 16GB will cost $1199, while the RTX 4080 12GB will cost $899.


Many had hoped for lower prices - but, according to Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, these costs reflect a world where Moore's law - where performance is doubled for half the price every two years - is now "dead".

What we're getting is a DLC package known as the Winters Expansion, which will include a third-person mode for the base game, a rework of the Mercenaries Mode which will introduce new playable characters such as Lady Dimitrescu, and the new story-based chapter known as Shadows of Rose.


Shadows of Rose will put Ethan Winters' daughter into the spotlight as she makes her way through the  consciousness of the Megamycete. This, Capcom has said, will conclude the Winters family story. However, Rose was not always going to be the focus of this story DLC. Instead, Capcom also had ideas for a Chris Redfield focused expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's head of PlayStation Indies Shuhei Yoshida has said PS Plus should be used by publishers to manage the lifecycle of a game.


Speaking at GI Live: London (thanks GamesIndustry.biz), Yoshida discussed Sony's approach to a subscription service, reiterating that the company still believes in the "premium release of a title at launch".



Yet with PS Plus, Sony is offering a different approach as added value to developers and publishers.

CD Projekt Red revealed the figure on Twitter, thanking new and returning players for spending time playing the game.

The announcement comes after a steady increase in player count for Cyberpunk 2077. Previously, numbers for the game on Steam were on the rise, making it one of Steam's top single-player games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk Edgerunners is fantastic, the latest in a recent line of impressive anime adaptations of video games. I’ve enjoyed the low-level shenanigans of its eclectic cast of sci-fi punks as they navigate the never-ending dystopia that is Night City. It presents a story more heartfelt than Cyberpunk 2077’s, with more likeable characters (not hard, when you consider the relentless - and inescapable - dickheadishness of Keanu Reeve’s Johnny Silverhand). Edgerunners, though, offers a slither of hope, and not just for its fictional characters. It shows CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk is still worth fighting for, despite everything.

CYBERPUNK 2077 SPOILERS ARE AHEAD.


I thought it impossible at first. Cyberpunk 2077’s launch was a car crash as catastrophic as any of the viral glitches the game spat out from some overloaded Night City crossroads. I had thought CD Projekt would fulfil its legal obligations and move on, like a cruel corpo washing their hands of a shady business deal gone wrong. Remember Witcher? Please, remember Witcher!

Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it's the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner.

Project in Cornwall. It'd been eight
years since I last saw them live and when they announced
the Eden shows, I thought it might be the only chance I'd get to see them for a
long time. I committed, and sods law, a week or so later they announced a
handful of single-night UK club shows. On the other hand, on previous tours
where they'd typically book two club nights in each city, I've attended one
night and always felt I should have done both, so this time I was making that
happen.

"Betwixt my eye and bone as neare to [the] backside of my eye as I could." This is quite a thing to do to yourself, but Newton was fixated. 


Newton was fixated with phosphenes, the frantic scattering light displays that erupt when you press your palms to your eyes and bother the optic nerve. Light from darkness: you can see why such an imbalance would have made Newton a bit grumpy. But also the wonder of it: these scrolling, tunneling, chequerboard passageways that seem to open up between you and the world around you. Magic.


Would Isaac Newton have liked Hyper Demon? I will leave this to others to judge. But Hyper Demon certainly loves phosphenes. This implausibly fast score-chasing micro-shooter coats its enemies in the shimmering, strobing pinks and dirty golds that phosphenes like to trade in. It wraps everything in a fish-eye lens, the queasiest of all lenses, just to give you that extra sense of being trapped deep within something, subdermal or far beneath the oceans. Horned skulls, praying hands, glittering diamonds that shatter on impact. Forget Newton, Hyper Demon makes me realise what a shame it is that Hieronymus Bosch never did a season for Juicy Couture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever played a game and thought, "Are we actually the bad guys here?" Usually, the whole "we're fighting on the wrong side of history" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, "Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy." It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Asobo has released its latest Sim Update for the majestic Microsoft Flight Simulator, this one bringing, among other things, long-awaited DLSS support for PC.


Alongside DLSS anti-aliasing and upscaling, Asobo says Sim Update 10 should deliver "stability, performance, and memory usage" improvements for those using Flight Simulator's in-development Direct X12 support - although it notes the new memory allocator will only be activated once Nvidia's next GPU driver is released.


Elsewhere in today's update, moving boats in the world now have a wake effect on PC, there's a new cloud layer system - said to provide "more vertical precision at low altitudes to better reflect the various cloud altitudes and thickness close to the ground" - plus a number of quality of life features for Flight Simulator's VFR map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Jupiter has unveiled an eighth mainline instalment for its mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, its big new addition being multiplayer support for up to four player when it launches next week. Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.


Picross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.


According to the official Picross website, it's local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there's a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox has called the release of Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands a "great victory" for the studio, saying its success means it "now clearly [has] a new franchise on its hands", with more "experiences" already in development.


Tiny Tina's Wonderlands released back in March, taking the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2's much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and building it out into a full-length game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


It was generally well-received by critics at launch - Eurogamer called it "endearing" despite its "hodgepodge design" - and it appears to have been enough of a commercial success that Gearbox is now eager to do more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A month after Dark Souls 3's Steam servers were finally bought online following more than seven months of downtime, they're offline again, with publisher Bandai Namco confirming it's currently "investigating" the issue.


The Dark Souls server woes began in January, when Bandai Namco was forced to disable servers for all Dark Souls games following reports of serious security concerns. Although the publisher described the situation as 'temporary' at the time, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3's servers finally coming back online at the end of August.


Unfortunately, the celebrations have been short-lived, and the game's PvP servers are once again unavailable, preventing players from accessing any of its online features.

Customisation options for the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2's Xbox button can be found in the latest version of the Xbox Accessories app on console and PC while a controller is connected. Here, users can visit the Colour tab to tinker with the Xbox button's brightness, or use the menu sliders to pick one out of a possible 16 million hues.


In addition to button customisation, September's Xbox update brings a revamp to the 'My games and apps' Full library view on consoles, streamlining access to all games available to install and play. Furthermore, 'All games' now displays every title a user has access to, including those on Game Pass, EA Access, and those claimed via Games with Gold.

The claim follows months of legal back and forth between cheat seller AimJunkies and Destiny developer Bungie, which has seen the former accused of both trademark and copyright infringement. 


AimJunkies has previously attempted to shrug off these claims, but has now gone one further. As reported by Torrentfreak, the cheat seller has now launched a countersuit which alleges Bungie accessed its computers for anti-cheat purposes via "clandestine surveillance" - effectively, that Bungie hacked it.

Call of the Sea - which initially launched for PC and consoles at the tail-end of 2020 - tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One's Cissy Jones), as she investigates a beautiful South Pacific island, circa 1934, in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully hits some powerful emotional beats even as it tips gently into cosmic weirdness.

Wingefors, whose company owns Saints Row developer Volition, acknowledged that views on the series' reboot had been "polarised" following its bug-laced release - in Eurogamer's Saints Row review, Vikki Blake noted that its 'Unto the Breach' mission was unplayable for her.


"There are a lot of things that could be said and details around it. I'm happy to see a lot of gamers and fans happy. At the same time I'm a bit sad to see fans also not happy," Lars told investors (via Axios' Stephen Totilo).

India, Pakistan, China and Jordan have also previously banned PUBG, whose mobile version specifically became particularly popular in these countries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover 'charms'. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it's something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many, my first thought upon seeing the GTA 6 leak was ‘fuck’. The second was a flashback to the protocols which had occurred when leaks or security breaches, no matter how minor, had happened when I was on the development side of the industry: usually, angry-faced men bursting into a room and demanding nobody touch anything. The third thought was what Rockstar, the king of image control and information flow, would do now. My mind ran to that sequence from The Bourne Identity, where an embattled CIA station chief demands the agency ‘get everybody up’. Everybody, in this instance, being a set of assassins, each with cool names and even colder intentions.   


To my knowledge, Matt Damon is not involved, and Rockstar’s brass has not dispatched Clive Owen to have a gun-point philosophical chat with the person responsible for this leak, much as it perhaps would like to. It has, however, teamed with the FBI, so maybe I wasn’t that far off. Either way, the response will be swift and all-encompassing, like what happened with the closest thing I can think of to this, the Half-Life 2 leak. (And we all know what happened there.)   


The reasons for such a response are obvious. There is a gigantic financial element in play here. There are security concerns regarding source code and other exposures which could well derail an entire project. And then there’s reputational damage, which has already occurred. Seconds after the leak, the internet was awash with people disappointed with how it looked. That it looked like shit. That if this was what it looks like, it would be a huge disappointment and, just quietly, what have the (lazy?) devs been up to all this time?

In a detailed blog post, Nvidia stated that "full ray tracing" will mean every level will be transformed. Light will now bounce around the settings, and "be affected by the scene's geometry and materials". Meanwhile, where shadows are being cast, these will be "pixel perfect".


"Portal's unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn't been done before its release," Nvidia elaborated. "With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step." You can see a little preview of Portal with RTX below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Unreal Engine 5 trailer hypung up an as-of-yet unnamed project based on the Korean Fantasy Novel, The Bird That Drinks Tears, has been released. The visual concept trailer, titled The Nhaga Eater, is a fairly violent affair kicking off with a decapitation before we see the brutal aftermath of a larger, bloodier battle.
This concept trailer, released by KRAFTON Inc, was released to showcase the future aesthetics of a variety of future projects KRAFTON are working on in collaboration with Iain McCaig, an American artist, writer, and film maker previously involved with IP such as Star Wars, Terminator, The Avengers, and more.
This trailer is the kicking off point for a variety of projects. There will indeed be a game, with no planned release date as of right now as KRAFTON is currently recruiting a team for the project. Until then, there’s an artbook releasing in 2022 followed by a graphic novel based on the same original Korean Novel to come in 2023. In the official press release, an official motion picture is also mentioned, although details on this are scarce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who's tenure at the company has seen the Battlefield franchise settle into a slump that no one knowns if it could ever break out of, sees an opportunity in the beleaguered series claiming Call of Duty's crown.
According to Wilson, said opportunity might be a reality, if and when rival shooter franchise Call of Duty becomes locked to Xbox.
Wilson, who attended the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2022, spoke about EA's current portfolio of games, some of what it plans to do with it going forward, and the company's ambitions in mobile and beyond.

"Investigations found there was no evidence substantiating the allegations of this former employee who resigned in 2019. We stand against all forms of harassment and take any allegation extremely seriously. We support those who have concerns they wish to raise. We therefore took the necessary time to thoroughly investigate allegations at Rocksteady Studios with the utmost integrity. 
"An external, independent law firm conducted a full and thorough investigation, including interviewing current and former employees, not only researching past allegations, but also examining the current culture of the studio. Furthermore, a Warner Bros. Discovery (then Warner Media) People Relations team, independent of the games division, diligently researched and investigated any allegations raised.

Our first look at the series was just a few seconds long, as the Blue Blur only popped up at the end of a promo clip. This time out, we get around 40 seconds of Sonic.
Announced in February as a collaboration between SEGA, WildBrain Studio (Carmen Sandiego, Ninjago), and Man of Action Entertainment (Marvel's Avengers Assemble, Big Hero 6), the 3D animated series will consist of 24 episodes full of introspection and discovery for Sonic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon's Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.

Perfect Head would have allowed players to scan a face into the game using the camera on a Game Boy, which could then be mapped onto a multiplayer character's head. The feature was complete and functional, but was removed from the game for its release. 

In an 2020 interview conducted by our own Wesley Yin-Poole, several of the developers revealed it had been removed at Nintendo's request due to the recent Columbine High School massacre and concerns over the feature's potential uses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new and detailed report by Bloomberg has highlighted the numbers of children who stream on Twitch, and the number of accounts linked to adult predators who follow and interact with them.


Research includes various examples of children being asked by adult users to engage in explicit or inappropriate activities and perform dances or "dares" while live-streaming. After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.


The report suggests this is due to "hundreds" of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with "more than 1000 kids on their following lists".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the gigantic GTA 6 leak last weekend, several developers have come forward in solidarity with Rockstar against misinformed claims that graphics are among the first aspects of a game finished during game development. How have they done so? By posting images and footage of their own early builds, and the basic and often-hilariously patched together early assets.
The source of all this, the aforementioned GTA 6 leak, was confirmed to be real. With video of an early version of the highly anticipated open world title out in the wild, anyone and everyone has been able to see the leak if they wish to do so. Some of them, including one (now locked) account which posted “If you knew how game development goes, you’d know that visuals are one of the first things done. The game is 4 years into planning & development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get.”
This, obviously, is wildly wrong. In response to this viral nonsense, several devs from a variety of sizable and independent developers have gone online and shown off unfinished visuals in early builds. Kurt Margenau — the co-lead for Uncharted 4 — retweeted a previously posted clip of the downhill car chase with blockmesh environments. This same video transitions between three distinct stages of completion and comes alongside a statement “there are a million stages in between”, further emphasising the amount of work happens before the visuals are finished.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the games I sampled at this year's Gamescom, Scorn surprised me the most. For whatever reason, I was expecting this survival horror adventure to ditch spookiness for kookiness, perhaps rattling my bones with hyper-violence and monsoons of crimson.
Nope - the game wasn't what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

This series of images was shared on Reddit by user M_S_1.


M_S_1 said they took inspiration from the featured games' concept art for their covers, calling it "a bit more timeless" to work from. "A character render with modern graphics would look pretty jarring for the era," they explained.

The highlight here is Infinity Ward's explanation for Modern Warfare 2's divisive mini-map, which has come under fire from some players for failing to provide enough information on enemy players.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2's mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their weapons.

"Why don't you for once just hire some Arabs [and] locals to ensure the places you seem to insist you gotta blow us up in would at least pass the critical gaze of say, a three-year-old," Ismail wrote on Twitter. "This is embarrassing to game development as a whole."

Almost 12 years have passed since Trails from Zero's Japanese launch and many JRPG fans had given up on the idea of an official western release.

NIS America did what many had thought impossible, and personally I could not be happier.


My own journey with Trails began in 2020. Having finished Ys VIII, a friend recommended Trails of Cold Steel and a year later – Reverie and Kuro aside – I'd finished the wider series.

Developer Rusty Lake has released 14 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner to date - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - each delivering a deliciously surreal, narratively interconnected slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant.


The Past Within is Rusty Lake's first attempt at a co-operative adventure, expanding the series' familiar formula, both spacially and temporally, as two players work together across different timelines - one located in the past, the other in the future - to solve the mysteries surrounding recurring series character Albert Vanderboom.

On seeing this leaked footage, some corners of the internet decided to use it as ammunition to criticise Rockstar's unfinished work.


"If you knew how game development goes, you'd know that visuals are one of the first things done. This game is four years into planning and development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get. The next year is mission coding and debugging. All backend stuff. It does look ass," claimed one Twitter user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch has updated its regulations on gambling on the streaming platform, following an outcry from streamers.


The new policy prohibits streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette, or dice games that aren't licensed in the US or "other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection" from 18th October.


This follows strike threats from some of the biggest Twitch streamers after former Team Liquid member ItsSliker admitted to have scammed viewers and fellow streamers out of $200k to fund his gambling addiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber John Allen, who accidentally outed himself as being behind a video games industry "insider" Twitter account, has issued an apology video in which he admits being motivated by "clout" and "the buzz". 


Allen gained brief internet fame by leaking details of Ubisoft's various Assassin's Creed announcements - details which he had been given by Ubisoft itself to prepare content while under embargo.


But his identity as "TheRealInsider" was exposed over the weekend, when Allen replied to a tweet from a fan from his main account instead. Allen then swiftly deleted the tweet, the insider account, and subsequently issued a brief Twitter statement saying sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're just a couple of days away from the second and final weekend of the Modern Warfare 2 beta. This round expands to PC and Xbox, and offers PlayStation players another chance to go hands-on with the multiplayer shooter.
As you might expect, players wasted no time offering feedback about design changes they liked, didn't like, and a few of the bugs and map exploits discovered thus far - even if many of those grievances return from Modern Warfare 2019 in a clear sign Infinity Ward doesn't intend to change them.
What the developer does actually want to do are a few tweaks in time for weekend two. In a blog post, Infinity Ward addressed several major points of feedback and whether or not they'll be changed this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the humble sphere. Now, imagine it crashing through some precariously placed wooden skittles at 40mph. That’s ten pin bowling in a nutshell, and it’s as high-octane a thrillride as it sounds.
PBA Pro Bowling 2023 may just be the greatest video game that has ever resulted from the coveted PBA Pro Bowling video game licence. And we’re not saying that lightly: we genuinely believe that it’s the best PBA Pro Bowling [YEAR] game since PBA Pro Bowling 2021 (that’s the last one, they skipped a year, dunno why didn’t ask).
In America, bowling is a serious televised sport with commentators and rules and that. Unfortunately, in Britain, it’s just a thing you might do if you’ve just come out of the cinema but feel like it’s too early to call it a night, and you also fancy some microwaved hot wings. They say our two nations are separated by a common language, but I’ve often felt that people who say that have failed to take into account the several thousand miles of ocean and divergent attitudes toward mid-tier leisure activities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus is a game that has brought out heaps of character requests from the community ever since its launch — earlier even! Being a platform fighter where vastly diverse Warner Bros characters battle it out, the title invites wishlists and an outpouring of What Ifs when it comes to upcoming fighters. Thanks to a recent bit of polling, we have a rough idea of what the most-requested community characters are.
Twitter user MrWhite4MVS, an account dedicated to spreading the good word of the Walter-White-for-MultiVersus, posted a round-up of each character mention in the character wishlist channel within the official MultiVersus Discord. At number one is Ben 10, followed by Walter White, The Warners, Mordecai & Rigby and Gumball.
Now obviously, it’s worth noting that character mentions aren’t exactly votes. One dedicated Mordecai & Rigby fan could just spam out mentions until they started annoying the mods, or a gaggle of Gumball lovers could all constantly meme post to victory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you stop people getting comfortable in a tower defence game? I think you know what I mean: that point where you're deep into a game, your defences are well established, and anything that tries to get through this, your abattoir, is made mincemeat of. You, at that point, are effectively hands off, admiring what you've built, and all the game can do is bulk up the enemies and try to brute force its way through. But what if there was another way? 


Isle of Arrows has an idea: a second base. Just as you're beginning to slouch and get comfortable, it introduces another base, and it's like starting all over again but at the same time as managing something else. Only now, you have one pool of resources to spread across both bases. Even more importantly: both bases share the same overall health pool. If enemies get through to your core in either one, you'll take damage, and as you only have about 10 hearts, and one life, this is important.


In other words, the danger is doubled, and if you ignore one base for the other, and allow a bad situation to fester, you could quickly find yourself in a precarious situation indeed.

I suspect, though, that I'm not alone, which is why it's such a relief that Square Enix is now bringing the game to practically every current platform available.


I recently went hands on with a demo of this lengthily-titled remaster - Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion - and I'm excited to dive in properly on its release this December.



Questions remain over the impact Crisis Core will have on the forthcoming second part (Rebirth) of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, but what's immediately clear from its remaster is how it's now clearly positioned as a side story to Remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of Frozen Planet 2, narrated by the one and only David Attenborough, BBC Earth has partnered with Minecraft to bring different audiences together. Following the release of each episode, which will air weekly, Minecraft Education has created five Frozen Planet 2-inspired worlds for Minecraft fans to try out.
Each Minecraft world is inspired by the Frozen Planet 2 episode before it, featuring immersive landscapes and game-based learning resources so that younger audiences can get more involved with the landmark series.
As one of the best-selling games of all time, with significant popularity across younger audiences, Minecraft also has a lesser-known Education Edition which is specifically aimed at providing educational content. This content is intended to help students learn about a variety of subjects via gameplay, and the team at Mojang Studios believes it is responsible for using Minecraft to create a better world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Citizen, the controversial space sim from developer Cloud Imperium Games, has now raised more than half a billion dollars in funding from backers.


Star Citizen's exceedingly lengthy development is well-documented, with the game still in alpha over a decade after production began. And while it's attracted some private funding in that time, the overwhelming bulk has come via crowdfunding, beginning with a successful $2m USD Kickstarter in 2012 and ballooning from there.


As of today, Star Citizen has amassed $500,075,150 USD in crowdfunding from a total of 4,096,384 backers, according to the official Roberts Space Industries website. Its previous major milestone of $400m USD raised was reached last November, meaning it's taken a further ten months to accrue an additional $100m.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has announced it will be raising its App Store prices in multiple territories - including every country that uses the euro, but excluding the UK at present - starting on 5th October.


As per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. 


When the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99. App Store developers who offer subscriptions will, however, have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If FIFA 23's 700+ plus real-life football clubs somehow aren't enough to be getting on with, it looks like you'll soon be able to sling a decidedly more imaginary one onto the pile, with all signs pointing to an appearance from Ted Lasso's AFC Richmond in this year's game.


Hints of an impending crossover with the award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series first emerged last week, when a listing for AFC Richmond - the fictional London team managed by Ted Lasso in the show - briefly appeared on EA's FIFA ratings database  before being removed.


That might have been the end of it, but now the official Ted Lasso Twitter account has shared an image showing what appears to be Ted Lasso actor Jason Sudeikis, albeit from behind, ensconced in the FIFA team's facial capture rig - used to digitise the real-world likeness of players (and, for the first time this year, managers) for use in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We've been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we're hard at work on content focusing on the firm's latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.
First impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It's easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we've seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you're one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.
We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we're not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we've put together a teaser video showing some of the work we've already done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll admit that I haven’t read a single thing about what the new RTX 40 Series GPUs give us. I know they are going to cost over a grand and that there are two models of card coming, but that’s about it. I saw some tweets about AI and someone mentioned Morrowind, at which point our video producer Jim Trinca fell off his Star Trek chair. 

I don’t care about that stuff, although I hope Jim didn’t break his Babylon 5 models he bought a 3D printer to make. I care about Portal with RTX. My mind almost bled out my ears when I saw this reveal happen in front of my near-melted eyeballs. Not only does it look incredible, but I had a vision that this would happen only this morning. 

Having sat pondering life and how I’m actually happy The Last of Us got a remake even though it’s not that old, I considered other games getting the same treatment. With my son playing Portal 2 as it’s on Games With Gold for Xbox, I thought, “Portal remake would be nice, wouldn’t it.” And oh yes it would. Just look at this trailer. Lovely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As expected, Nvidia have announced the GeForce RTX 4090 during their GeForce Beyond livestream – and confirmed the RTX 4080 for good measure. Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

For several months now, Larson has been voicing the role of Paradigm, one of the game's heroic Seven. The Captain Marvel actress debuted as Paradigm in Fortnite's Chapter 3 Season 2 live event, where she commanded players as they took control of the game's infamous bear mech. 


Larson has regularly popped up since, voicing audio logs and mission chatter for Fortnite's weekly tasks through the recently-concluded Chapter 3 Season 3. Now, with the launch of Season 4, we've seen her with her helmet off for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an understatement to say that this past weekend has been a pretty big one for video game leaks. That sentiment is primarily driven by the huge story of a hacker breaking into Rockstar games’ systems and illegally revealing vast swathes of the next Grand Theft Auto game – but as that happened another story quietly unfoldedd, one of the undoing of a recent rising star of the leaker community. It’s also a story that, I’d argue, exposes how silly this whole leaking affair is. 

If you don’t follow Games Twitter with a laser focus (and who can blame you), here’s what happened. A new Twitter account popped up called ‘TheRealInsider’, and it began revealing things about upcoming gaming announcements and marketing beats. People quickly started paying attention because it got stuff right. Its initial big break was revealing information about Ubisoft’s huge slate of upcoming Assassin’s Creed games – and then more and more information about other games followed. It grew a huge following in a very short time. 
As part of that Assassin’s Creed reveal, TheRealInsider made a rookie error. When one high-profile member of the media not clued in about the upcoming Assassin’s projects said he wasn’t sure their claims were true, they got smug. There was some mocking, some boasting. When the announcement came, some ‘I told you so’.

Along with this teaser, which you can see below, Sega has assured us that Sonic will "shatter" our worlds when Sonic Prime airs this winter on Netflix. And yes, I feel quite agitated writing about a Netflix show with the word 'Prime' in its title.

The Nvidia RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are the first GPUs from the 'Ada Lovelace' series, and they should be up to twice as fast as their last-gen counterparts in rasterised games - and up to four times as fast in ray-traced games.  
The RTX 4090 24GB will be available on October 12th and costs $1599, while the RTX 4080 16GB arrives in November and costs $1199. There's also an RTX 4080 12GB model that costs $899. The 4090 and 4080 are reportedly two to four times faster than their Ampere equivalents, which are the 3090 Ti and the 3080 Ti, respectively. 
Note that Nvidia RTX 30-series cards will remain on sale for the moment, filling in the bottom part of the market until lower-tier RTX 40-series GPUs arrive.

The project is in the works at Star Wars Squadrons studio Motive, which is also developing the upcoming Dead Space remake.


The game - which is yet to be titled - still seems some way off, and EA lists it as in pre-production. As with other recent early announcements, the confirmation appears to have been made to spur recuitment on the game (and also follows earlier whispers of its existence).

Now, one such mod has given the game a literal face lift, by replacing the new model of Peter Parker with that of the game's original PlayStation 4 one. 


This mod was uploaded to Nexus mods by DaigronCDM. Known as the 'John Bubniak - PS4 face restoration mod', it does exactly as you'd expect. It makes Peter Parker look more like John Bubniak, Spidey's original face model before the character was redesigned to look more like actor Yuri Lowenthal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There may be a new PS5 on the horizon, if the sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are to be believed. This shiny new PS5 will have a detachable disc drive, allowing you to plug in and play any physical games you've got lying around. This PS5 will also apparently abandon the A, B and C chassis that previous iterations have used. It will however have the same hardware capabilities as current models.
According to the anonymous sources who spoke to Insider Gaming, the detachable disc drive will connect to the PS5 via a USB port at the back of the console. This new console will reportedly be sold on its own or as part of a bundle, with the detachable drive also being sold seperately so you can (relatively) cheaply replace it if you swing it around, step on it, or bust it up via other methods.
It's no secret that the PS5 has been a product that many have been desperately trying to grab since its release back in 2020! This new version of the console appears to bridge the gap between the regular and digital PS5s, so if you weren't too sure which version was ideal for you, the best of both worlds is now available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 will host a confidential closed End Game beta, and it will be the first opportunity for select players to participate in testing an early version of the game.
It will be held on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 consoles. Cross-play and cross-progress for all platforms will also be supported.
Blizzard said it decided to focus on the end game for a few reasons, but chief among those is it doesn’t want to spoil the full story of Diablo 4. For many, the end game is their favorite aspect of Diablo, anyway, so the team wants to test it out to ensure it "feels satisfying" and that there will be ample time to act on feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deathloop is now, finally, a multiplatform title. After a year of timed exclusivity to the PS5 (a deal infamously struck prior to Microsoft’s acquisition of its studio) it’s now out on Xbox Series S/X, but perhaps more importantly, it’s now available on subscription services – both Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Extra – so it has never been easier or cheaper to experience this underappreciated gem of a game.
The guts of it are basically identical: it plays exactly the same on all platforms, although with Xbox you do of course lose the impressive haptics of the DualSense controller. But, there is a trade-off on Series X, as far as I can tell at least: the framerate in Visual Quality mode (the one that looks nicer than performance but isn’t raytracing) is noticeably smoother on Series X, although I’d like to caveat that this is purely based on some quick A/B testing and doesn’t take into account that the two machines handle variable refresh rate differently (according to Digital Foundry, the PS5 implementation isn’t as good, for what it’s worth).
But look, look, none of that matters: it’s DEATHLOOP, and it’s no longer gated behind a £60 entry fee. Which is a great thing, as Dom argues here, as Deathloop struggled to find an audience back at launch, due in no small part to its premium price point and the scarce availability of next-gen consoles at the time. Particularly PS5s, which are still tricky to get a hold of to this day.

Except the game didn’t seem to be following the naming convention of its predecessor Yakuza: Like A Dragon, instead ditching the part associated with the Japanese crime syndicate.

Fulfilment of the final remaining Q4 batch is now fully underway, after a smaller handful of lucky Q4-ers were bumped forward into Q3.

This is obviously true for the yearly Call of Duty releases, but the new Modern Warfare series has been a particularly sore spot for the most devoted fans.
The Modern Warfare 2 beta just ended its first weekend – available on a single platform – but already, we're seeing a high level of engagement from players who jumped in since servers went live.
What struck me as a little strange wasn't the volume of posts on Reddit, and social media, it was that the complaints being made about Modern Warfare 2 are the same exact ones we heard during the Modern Warfare 2019 beta and launch – often by the same people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After last week's info blowout, the open beta for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 went live over the weekend, allowing us to get intimate with all the new mechanics and systems for the follow-up to Infinity Ward's 2019 reboot (and not to be confused with 2009's Modern Warfare 2, of course). Things were kept intimate when it comes to game modes, too, with a focus on 6v6 stalwarts - as well as a cameo from the returning third-person playlist - which helped underline how different it feels. Does it work? Well opinion is split, so here's two takes from two very different kinds of Call of Duty players. 
Martin: So let's get this out the way first - I'm a filthy casual when it comes to CoD. I pick up every game on launch, blast through the campaign (or as has been the case in recent years, get bored of it after an hour or two and never pick it up again) then spend a couple of dozen hours or so in the multiplayer, dipping in and out over the year. So I'm not exactly the one to be drilling down into the details. I will say this, though - having blown cold on the series since Infinity Ward's 2019 brilliant reboot, this has properly sucked me back in, and I was shocked how different it feels to the first Modern Warfare. Or the second one - the one that came out in 2019, that is. Anyway, it's an amazingly slow take on the Call of Duty formula, and the tense pacing has really caught me by surprise. 
Wes: It definitely plays slower, and I think that’s by Infinity Ward’s design. Everything from the slide cancelling nerf to the blisteringly fast time to kill forces you to play more cautious. The mini map isn’t much help at all, and having to wait four or eight minutes into a match to unlock certain perks that make you quieter adds a tactical element to what has been a traditionally fast-paced, run-and-gun 6v6 Call of Duty multiplayer. The footsteps are so loud!

Talking to IGN, Director Kento Kinoshita stated Capcom is "creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga."


This means any future entries to the series will likely introduce us to a new set of characters or bring back some older faces from the previous generations of games - though Capcom itself is tight-lipped on any further details.

"In a world where there may be questions over the future of Call of Duty and what platforms that might be on or might not be on, being platform agnostic and completely cross-platform with Battlefield, I think is a tremendous opportunity," Wilson said.

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

If we’re being honest, building up to the release is the only thing to do right now. However, it can be a source of pain and frustration for some — be it through farming Alterac Valley or struggling to get past (the now far smaller) login queues.
However, its professions that stand out as the foundation to the latest major pain point for forward-thinking players. Right now, in game, players are fighting tooth and nail over ore all around the world of Azeroth and Outland. Far from the battlegrounds and arenas are brawls over mining nodes.
“Nodes aren’t plentiful in vanilla classic as they weren't on game release,” says Squee, a level 53 Priest levelling on the Thekal fresh server in the weeks leading up to Wrath of the Lich King. “There are only a few zones where you can get ore and level up, and at the moment, no matter which zone you go to, you’ll run into 3-4 other players running the same route”. They are one of many players currently farming mining in order to funnel resources towards jewelcrafting and / or engineering.

How did Allen know these details? He had been pre-briefed by Ubisoft itself on the contents of its presentation under embargo - which he then promptly ignored and wrote anonymously about on the internet.

In his review, Alex called it Arkane's best game yet – a confident successor to Dishonored, and a bold demonstration of what developer Arkane can do when it’s unshackled from legacy IP (whether or not it has a choice in the matter). 

But I, like many others I know, did not play this exemplary realisation of the immersive sim genre when it launched. The game dropped to $40 on the PS5 just weeks after launch. The conversation around it dried up quickly. And that’s not fair on the game, not really, because it’s a little slice of video gaming perfection, dressed up with stylish 70s-esque cool, loaded with more quips than a Bond flick, and brimming with enough genius gameplay ideas to make even the folks at Irrational Games blush.

It’s not the first time the prohibitively expensive nature of new-gen, platform-specific games has caused issues for developers trying to find an audience (here’s looking at you, Returnal). These experimental, impressive, and – in my eyes – essential games are simply overlooked by many, purely because that initial point of entry asks for so much cash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first read Paul Auster when I was at university. A tutor recommended The Music of Chance, I think, and I ended up reading all of his stuff in one of those bursts of love you sometimes get for writers. Then, I sort of dropped out of the Auster business. At the beginning of lockdown, I re-read Leviathan, on a whim, and didn't love it. I re-read The New York Trilogy, which I had adored the first time around, and thought it was fine.


Auster's a weird writer, and he's weird in a way that no other writer I've encountered is weird. He's playful yet also humourless. Is that combination even possible? Auster suggests it is: his stuff is filled with games and allusions and illusions, riffs on Don Quixote or Tesla  - but you can't really imagine any of his protagonists ever laughing, and his text unfolds elegantly while being scrubbed clean of much in the way of character.


He reminds me, in a way, of Magritte, and not just because of the way Auster flirts with surrealism. Magritte paints magical things, but in the most pedestrian manner. That's not a knock on him - it's part of the effect. Astonishing things happen to Auster characters, but they describe their adventures as if they're describing a trip to the grocery store.

The gssproxy project makes it possible to introduce privilege separation to reduce the attack surface. There is a tutorial for RPM-based distributions (Fedora, RHEL, AlmaLinux, etc), but I wanted to get this to work on a DPKG-based distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel, PureOS, etc) and found it worthwhile to document the process. I’m using Ubuntu 22.04 below, but have tested it on Debian 11 as well.  I have adopted the gssproxy package in Debian, and testing this setup is part of the scripted autopkg…]]></summary>

But trying to use them both at the same time doesn't work super well, because if you hit a WebAuthn request on the remote machine it doesn't matter how much you mash your token - it's not going to work.
But could it?
The SSH agent protocol abstracts key management out of SSH itself and into a separate process. When you run "ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa", that key is being loaded into the SSH agent. When SSH wants to use that key to authenticate to a remote system, it asks the SSH agent to perform the cryptographic signatures on its behalf. SSH also supports forwarding the SSH agent protocol over SSH itself, so if you SSH into a remote system then remote clients can also access yo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2018, I made a two part series about terminal emulators
that was actually pretty painful to write. So I'm not going to retry
this here, not at all. Especially since I'm not submitting this to the
excellent LWN editors so I can get away with not being very good
at writing. Phew.
Still, it seems my future self will thank me for collecting my
thoughts on the terminal emulators I have found out about since I
wrote that article. Back then, Wayland was not quite at the level
where it is now, being the default in Fedora (2016), Debian (2019),
RedHat (2019), and Ubuntu (2021). Also, a bunch of folks thought they
would solve everything by using OpenGL for rendering. Let's see how
things stack up.

In this latest season, a mysterious substance has appeared on the island, which is very chrome in look and presumably feel. Using a chrome splash has an interesting effect, where throwing it at a wall will let you literally just walk through it, which sounds like a fun way to mix things up.


Chroming yourself, a sentence I never thought I'd write, will let you speed around as a blob while sprinting, and during the limited buff you'll be immune to fire damage. Being blobbed, as Epic Games puts it, will also make you immune to fall damage, and gives you a little air dash. Dashing into any building piece also chrome-ifys it, which as established, lets you phase through it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My favourite Monkey Island story isn't about a puzzle or a character or a joke. It's not Stan and his hand-talking, or the severed head that can lead you through mazes. It's not actually a story from the game itself. It's to do with a friend of my wife's. This friend once admitted that, as a kid, whenever she had a story she wanted to tell her mum, her mum would always stop her at the start and say, with what I'm guessing was a heavy, deeply theatrical sigh, "Is this about Monkey Island?"


I think about this a lot. A kid who was so in love with Monkey Island, who spoke about it with such granularity and such endless passion, that it made their mum grow wary of every fresh conversation. To this day whenever I'm particularly boring my wife will stop me and say, "Is this about Monkey Island?" Conversation ended. Conversation defeated.


And of course the funny thing is, if there was ever a game worth talking about it's Monkey Island. Let me clarify: loads of games are worth talking about, but Monkey Island - the first one - is singular in how much it's worth telling people about. Things happened in that game that felt unprecedented back in the early 1990s. The scope of it, the richness of the Caribbean setting, the ease of the comedic tone. But also the set-pieces. The fact that the fourth wall was acknowledged and then shattered. As school kids playing this game in the evenings and weekends, game characters who were almost aware they were game characters - who were made to say things that they realised they hadn't chosen to say? Well, this felt almost illicit. Maths room, 9am on a Monday: You will not believe what happened in Monkey Island last night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To plant my piratey flag up front, I am an extremely huge fan of the Monkey Island series, and am therefore almost exactly who Return To Monkey Island is aimed at. After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won't be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn't expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a shorter DF Direct blog this week - it's supposed to be a public holiday - but our weekly show goes live on YouTube as normal and it's a special one on two accounts. First of all, there's well over two hours of discussion to wade through, covering the latest Sony State of Play, last week's Nintendo Direct and the biggest news from the Tokyo Game Show. The second factor that makes this one rather special? That'll be a 40 minute (!) guest slot for none other than Eurogamer's Ian Higton!
You may have watched and read Ian's excellent PlayStation VR 2 content last week - but we had questions about the new headset. Lots of them. As we didn't get to see the hardware in person, we pinned down Ian (not literally) and bombarded him with our queries. Rather obligingly, Ian was very forthcoming and his segment is the centrepiece of this week's show. Beyond that, it's about State of Play as we mull over the likes of God of War Ragnarok, Tekken 8 and Rise of the Ronin, while Alex has much to say about Capcom's ExoPrimal, which wasn't in the State of Play but ended up as a discussion point anyway.
We also talk about the latest Nintendo Direct with titles including Octopath Traveller 2, Pikmin 4, Bayonetta 3, Radiant Silvergun and GoldenEye to look forward to, while there's also the matter of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Alex gets sweet, sweet revenge on his critics (on the matter of, um, volumetric clouds) and we ponder whether the game is still 'too big for Switch'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers is getting an open beta this week, and those with green and pink thumbs will be happy to hear about the addition of Farmer and Majin Buu.


While he's not the most memorable character in the world, Farmer did appear in a number of the various arcs in Dragon Ball Z, and now Bandai Namco has announced that you'll be able to play as him in the upcoming Dead by Daylight-like Dragon Ball: The Breakers. Most notably, he has a shotgun, but it probably isn't all that useful.


Villains wise, considering he's on the boxart, we generally already knew that Majin Buu was going to be in the game, but the pink blob has been officially confirmed to be coming to the game, with all three of his forms to evolve through. Disgustingly, it looks like that if you do get swallowed up by the Super Buu you can run around his guts, and will possibly have a chance to escape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar has acknowledged the enormous Grand Theft Auto 6 leak of work-in-progress development materials that took place over the weekend.
In a statement published this afternoon on Twitter, as the company returned to work, Rockstar admitted it had suffered a "network intrusion" - a hack - from which the early development footage of GTA 6 had been taken.
Rockstar said it hoped the hack would have no impact on its live services - such as GTA Online - and insisted the leak would not impact the development of the game long-term. Still, Rockstar acknowleged it was "extremely disappointed" at what had happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has said that the upcoming Resident Evil Village DLC will be the last bit of story focused on the Winters family.


Not sure if there's anyone that is particularly passionate about Ethan Winters and his family compared to other classic characters in the Resi series like cutie Leon, but for those out there that might want to know, the upcoming Shadows of Rose DLC will be the last to be all about the Winters family.


In an interview with IGN Japan at Tokyo Game Show, director Kento Kinoshita said Capcom is "creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga." So essentially, expect some fresh faces in future entries, or at least to see older characters return as protagonists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the weekend's big Grand Theft Auto leak, it now turns out that there's been an also pretty big Diablo 4 leak, as test footage has cropped up online. 


As shared by Reddit user iV1rus0 on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, about 53 minutes of the upcoming sequel is available to watch as a pair of videos, one that's around five minutes in length, the other around 38 minutes. While the GTA 6 footage was the result of a hack, this Diablo footage appears to be from a Discord stream, as the app's notification sounds can be heard in the background.


You can even hear the people streaming the game, though their voices have been distorted, likely as to protect their identity. Though all of the footage has been watermarked, so who knows how effective that will be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar has issued a statement earlier on the ongoing saga of the GTA 6 leaks, which resulted in heaps of videos and screenshots from the unannounced game appear online over the weekend.
While the developer, and its parent company Take-Two, moved quickly to take down as many of them on social media and video platforms as possible, the damage had already been done. Given the nature of the leaks themselves (clearly originating from development builds), it was assumed that the developer's network had been hacked.
This was, in fact, an accurate guess. In a statement posted to Twitter, the studio acknowledged the leak, confirming that it was the result of an unauthorised network breach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The weekend has brought Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two, a lot of headaches. A massive amount of GTA 6 development videos and screenshots were published online by an anonymous leaker. GTA never suffered a leak at this scale, and the material understandably got published everywhere.
The footage and screenshots showed various bits of gameplay, a Red Dead Redemption 2-like conversation system, some vehicle action, and a bit of the open world. More importantly, it featured the rumoured protagonist, and seemingly confirmed the Vice City setting, which has long been rumoured, and recently confirmed by a Bloomberg report.
The leaks were posted by a user named teapotuberhacker on the GTA Forums. Since then, the thread was locked and the media removed, though it's available to read once again at the time of this writing.

There's obvious mutual appeal to having developers use their own hardware rather than rely on employer-provided hardware. The user gets to use hardware they're familiar with, and which matches their ergonomic desires. The employer gets to save on the money required to buy new hardware for the employee. From this perspective, there's a clear win-win outcome.
But once you start thinking about security, it gets more complicated. If I, as an employer, want to ensure that any systems that can access my resources meet a certain security baseline (eg, I don't wa…]]></summary>

of my WAP WML browser wApua and also uploaded that release to Debian Unstable.




It’s a bugfix release and the first upstream release since 2017.


WAP WML pages with more recent DTD
location URLs ending in .dtd instead of .xml
(and some other small difference). No idea when these URLs changed,
but I assume they have been changed to look more like the URLs of
other DTDs. The old URLs of the DTD still work, but more recent WAP
pages (yes, they do exist :-) seem to use the new DTD URLs, so there
was a need to recognise them instead of throwing an annoying warning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4090 is all but confirmed now, based on the sheer volume of leaks, rumours and speculation showing off the next-gen Nvidia GPU in a variety of guises but sharing the same specs. That's pushed the prices of current-gen GPUs way down, and that's especially true for high-end cards. Ergo, it's not a massive surprise to see the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, Team Green's flagship card, down to just $999 at Amazon after debuting at twice that figure.

Consequently, the dedicated playlist will be "rotated out" and will instead "roll into Quick Play" at the beginning of November.

"While we know many players have enjoyed this new mode introduced in Season 2, at this stage it’s been steadily declining and starting to fall short of the quality bar for a positive player experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent batch of Apex Legends weapon skins have been causing some controversy as a number of players believe that the aim down sights (ADS) are better than on other skins.


As reported by PCGamesN, some pay-to-win accusations have been thrown at developer Respawn due to the introduction of weapon skins like the Heat Sink skin. According to some players, the Heat Sink skin has a vastly superior ADS compared to other guns' skins. However, Respawn has since addressed the criticism, providing an update on said skin and more.


"Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends," wrote Respawn in a blog post. "As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn't be a factor in the sights functionality as well. During Season 4, we released the Heat Sink reactive skin for the VK-47 Flatline rifle and we heard feedback from some players that the Aim Down Sights (ADS) felt superior to any other skin available.

As reported by Eurogamer, if you log on to the Xbox app on PC you'll notice that there's now a section titled HowLongToBeat which shows you how long the main story, main story and extras, completing the game fully, and all styles of play averages are. The main purpose of HowLongToBeat is literally to tell you how long it will take you to beat a game, which can be useful if you're quite particular about how you plan your time.


Of course, games listed on there aren't guaranteed to be the length of time listed, because it's all based on user data. On the main site it will tell you the average, median, rushed, and leisurely times for each category, which will generally be a better indicator of how long you personally will take to complete a game.

Like its Dark Souls predecessor, it is quite simply called Elden Ring The Board Game, though not much about the board game itself has been revealed as of yet. The game is planned to be funded via Kickstarter, which you can sign-up to be notified when it launches.

Well, we've got a whole new generation of Xbox consoles now, and still now catgirls or Paladins in sight. Now, as reported by Game Watch (translations by VGC), Spencer has reiterated his commitment to bringing the game to the platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI-generated imagery is here. Type a simple description of what you want to see into a computer and beautiful illustrations, sketches, or photographs pop up a few seconds later. By harnessing the power of machine learning, high-end graphics hardware is now capable of creating impressive, professional-grade artwork with minimal human input. But how could this affect video games? Modern titles are extremely art-intensive, requiring countless pieces of texture and concept art. If developers could harness this tech, perhaps the speed and quality of asset generation could radically increase. 


However, as with any groundbreaking technology, there's plenty of controversy too: what role does the artist play if machine learning can generate high quality imagery so quickly and so easily? And what of the data used to train these AIs - is there an argument that machine learning-generated images are created by effectively passing off the work of human artists? There are major ethical questions to grapple with once these technologies reach a certain degree of effectiveness - and based on the rapid pace of improvement I've seen, the questions may need to be addressed sooner rather than later.


In the meantime, the focus of this piece is to see just how effective these technologies are right now. I tried three of the leading AI generators: DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney. You can see the results of these technologies in the embedded video below (and indeed in the collage at the top of this page) but to be clear, I generated all of them, either by using their web portals or else running them directly on local hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing VR for a very long time now so my legs are pretty sturdy, but when legendary flatscreen to VR modder Raicuparta approached me with a preview build of his Neon White VR mod, I must admit I was a little apprehensive.
Surely a lightning-fast game like that would push me over the edge? I thought. But, oh my, how wrong I was. Not only was playing Neon White in VR a completely comfortable experience (for me - newcomers to VR beware!) but it also felt like the perfect 'just one more go' VR game.
Playing Neon White in virtual reality was my first ever experience with the game, flat or not, and it honestly felt like a perfect fit for the medium. You can watch me demonstrate how this mod affects the gameplay of Neon White in this week's episode of VR Corner, which features me swearing my way through a good chunk of the levels from Mission 3.

Steamforged Games - the team behind the Horizon Zero Dawn, Resident Evil, and Dark Souls tabletop games - will be launching a Kickstarter campaign "soon" to bring the officially-sanctioned board game adaptation to fruition. 

"Like the video game, the Elden Ring board game will immerse players in the forsaken Lands Between," explains a press release from the company. "In a vast, sprawling world of decaying grandeur that unfolds through their exploration, 1-4 ‘Tarnished’ players will embark on a huge and varied adventure, visiting iconic locations and crossing paths with familiar enemies and characters."

PlayStation itself confirmed the news earlier this week on its official Twitter account (September 16), writing "Sharpen your needles – confirming Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to PS5 and PS4." Of course, this being Silksong news, that's about as far as the update stretches, but it is good to know that the game will be coming to a range of platforms at the very least.


Earlier this year at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, we got another snippet of Silksong gameplay, confirming that the game would also be coming to Xbox consoles, though didn't specify which. It was also announced that the game would be on Game Pass day one though, a big win for subscribers to the service. But there's been no mention of whether it will be available on any of the PlayStation Plus expanded tiers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Piece Odyssey finally has a release date, as confirmed in a new trailer that says it will launch January 13, 2023.


Announced in a new trailer from Bandai Namco at Tokyo Game Show, fans of the Straw Hat Crew will be able to join the lovable pirates in their next video game adventure in just a few months. The new trailer sets up some of the story in the game, which unsurprisingly takes away the powers of each of the characters. As in many Shonen anime, the crew is quite overpowered these days, so you've got to do something to nerf them at the start of the game.


The Straw Hat Crew will have to collect cubes in order to regain their powers, though the trailer being mostly cinematics, it didn't show exactly how you'll be doing that.

Earlier today, a large number of videos and screenshots of what looks to be an early build of what is presumably an early build of GTA 6 have cropped up online. If these leaks are real, what has been shown lines up with what Bloomberg reported earlier this year on the upcoming sequel from Rockstar.


GTA 6, or whatever the next game in the series will be called, was confirmed to be in active development. Rockstar is yet to share any information on what the game is set to be like, but according to Bloomberg's report, the sequel will once again feature two protagonists, one being a Latina woman, a first for the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's Gran Turismo movie is ramping up, as it casts Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom and Stranger Things' David Harbour.


Earlier this year Sony announced that it would be making a Gran Turismo movie, which is certainly a choice for a series that isn't exactly known for its narrative. Now, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Stranger Things and Black Widow star David Harbour will be joining the film, though details of his role haven't been shared yet. And soon after, it was announced that Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean star Orlando Bloom has also been cast in the film.


District 9 and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp is set to direct the project, with a screenplay from Jason Hall (American Sniper). On the production side, PlayStation Productions Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan will produce alongside Doug Belgrad, and Dana Brunetti. A Gran Turismo movie has actually been in development since 2013, but it's unclear if this is meant to be the same film, or another attempt at making one.

The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won't find a link to them here, because the truth is, they're simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn't going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it's actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

Whilst there's no way of authenticating them, the initially hostile response on the GTA Forums eventually softened as posters began to believe that the leaked assets were genuine.

Whilst, naturally, the unfinished game has missing assets and features, the videos give a rudimentary peek at the protagonists, the open world, and even the shooter's combat, totalling over seven minutes' worth of unsanctioned footage.

Over in Japan right about now the Makuhari Messe is thrumming, its halls filled with the hushed excitement of a Tokyo Game Show that's approaching full swing after three years on the lowdown. It's an odd feeling seeing it all unfurl from afar - one of the great privileges of my job in pre-pandemic years was attending the show for Eurogamer, and being on the ground in Japan as it celebrates its gaming industry really was every bit as wonderful as you'd imagine. 


I've enough anecdotes over the years to fill a fairly sordid book, though to preserve the dignity of those involved - and myself - very few of them will ever see the light of day (and I'm pretty sure Wes and Tom still haven't forgiven me for the stress I put them through as they tried to drag me from a Shinjuku bar in the early hours of the morning to get our flight home).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a new Monkey Island game coming next week, we decided to get a couple of Guybrush superfans together to talk about this magical, evocative, and hilarious series.

Chris Donlan: Years ago when I was at school, a friend of mine had Monkey Island on the family PC. I remember the PC was kept in the hallway, and we used to play for hours and hours into the evening. My memories of Melee Island at night are sort of mingled with the night of my friend’s house as we used to play this thing. I wonder: what are your early memories of Monkey Island? When did you realise it was the thing for you?

Victoria Kennedy: It was also a friend for me, or at least one of my brother’s friends. My first memories of Monkey Island are not actually playing it, but seeing other people playing it. I can clearly recall being so entranced by the music (something that to this day still gives me a delighted rush of Dopamine whenever I hear it), and also the colours. To put it simply, it really made me happy.

Future, which has put effective altruism back in the news.  That plus the
decision by GiveWell to
remove GiveDirectly from their top charity list got me thinking about
charity again.  I think effective altruism, by embracing long-termism, is
falling into an ethical trap, and I'm going to start heavily discounting
their recommendations for donations.


Background
Charity
Navigator measure overhead and (arguable) waste, but they don't ask
whether the on-the-ground work of the charity has a positive effect
proportional to the resources it's expending.
This is a good question to
ask.



GiveWell is a charity research

A few days ago somebody asked me and I think it is an often requested to perhaps all fiction readers as to why we like fiction? First of all, reading in itself is told as food for the soul. Because, whenever you write or read anything you don’t just read it, you also visualize it. And that visualization is and would be far greater than any attempt in cinema as there are no budget constraints and it takes no more than a minute to visualize a scenario if the writer is any good. You just close your eyes and in a moment you are transported to a different world. This is also what is known as ‘world building’. Something fantasy writers are especially gifted in.

"Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends," Respawn said. "As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn't be a factor in the sights functionality as well.

"For the Ishin remake, we’re using subtitles," said Yokoyama. "We’re not dubbing voiceovers. We’re translating the game into English, but the specialized vocabulary and the way people talked during the Bakumatsu era would make the lines incredibly long, so it just wouldn’t work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck may well be the most mainstream example of the handheld gaming PC, but Valve is certainly not the first company to give the concept a shot. Other manufacturers got there first and continue to innovate with intriguing products. The AyaNeo Air is the most exciting of those handhelds yet, in that it's something of an anti-Deck. The Air is small and easy to handle in the way that Steam Deck is not. It has the OLED panel with the inky blacks and incredible contrast that the Deck's mediocre IPS LCD does not. Also - for good or bad - it runs on Windows 11, meaning that it plays everything, something that remains beyond the Deck when running the default Steam OS. 
First impressions are compelling, exactly because of its miniature form factor, like a kind of hybrid between Switch, Switch Lite and PlayStation Vita. But it's at this point we should point out that there are actually two versions of the AyaNeo air - a standard model with a 28Wh battery and a thicker, heavier Pro model with a 38Wh variant. Battery life, as we shall discover, is a real problem on the standard machine. 
What both have in common are the same basic aesthetics, the same excellent analogue sticks and face buttons, the same lovely display and the same SD card reader. I found the shoulder triggers a little 'spongy' for my tastes while the shoulder buttons feel a little insubstantial but there are some genuine nice ideas here, such as USB-Cs top and bottom, both capable of charging.

In an interview with Yakuza fan site Tojo Dojo, Yokoyama revealed that whilst the Yakuza series has sometimes offered English voice-acting, Like a Dragon: Ishin's "specialised vocabulary [...] would make the lines incredibly long", so the game will be translated into English via subtitles.

“No, [Western players] don’t really watch subtitled content," Yokoyama acknowledged in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer). "Especially in English speaking countries. That’s why they prefer to have voice overs.

        <updated>2022-09-17T07:56:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In June I caved and bought a Prusa
Mini
3D printer for home. I bought it just before an announced price hike. I went
for a Prusa because of their reputation for "just working", and the Mini mostly
as its the cheapest, although, the print area (7"³) is large enough for most of
the things I am likely to print.






To get started, at the same time I bought some Prusament recycled
PLA to print
with which, unfortunately, I've been a little disappointed with.
I was attracted to the idea of buying a recycled material and Prusa make a lot
about the quality of their filaments.
The description was pretty clear that the colour would be somewhat random and
vary throughout the spool, but I didn't mind that, and I planned to use it for
mainly functional prints where the precise colour didn't matter. The colour
examples from the product page were mostly off-white grey with some tint,
typically green. There are not a lot of reviews of the recycled PLA that
comment on the colour of their spools, but in a couple of youtube videos
(1,
2) the spools have looked a
grey-ish silver, sometimes with a greenish tint, pretty similar to the product
page.
The colour I got is quite unlike those: it's a dull brown, with little flecks
of glitter, presumably originally from recycling something like Galaxy
Black.
That's totally within "spec", of course, but it's a bit boring.


Brown recycled Prusament PLA on the right
In terms of quality, sadly I've ended up with had at least one tangle in the
spool wind so far. There's at least two reviews on their own product page from
people who have had similar difficulties.
Edit:
I realised after I wrote this post that I hadn't actually
written much about the printer. That's because I'm still in the early days of
using it. In short I'd say it's a very high quality machine, very pleasant to
use. Since I also went on a tangent about the recycled Prusament, the tone of
the whole post was more negative than I intended. Watch this space for some
more positive Prusa news soon!]]></summary>

The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There's also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that's available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

That's more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you're getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment head and Battlefield franchise boss Vince Zampella has spoken about the reception - and failure - of the series' most recent entry, Battlefield 2042, suggesting it "strayed too far from" its roots.


Battlefield 2042 was dogged by technical issues and controversial design decisions when it launched last year, quickly attracting overwhelmingly negative reviews from players on Steam.


Since then, developer DICE has continued to tweak and expand on Battlefield 2042's wobbly base, but it's often felt like too little, too late - with publisher EA admitting the game's sales "did not meet expectations", saying, "Some of the design choices we made...did not resonate with everyone in our community".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC graphics card manufacturer EVGA has announced that it will terminate making all GPU hardware at the end of this current hardware generation, following a large-scale falling out with GPU tech titan Nvidia. 


In a move that is likely to have significant repercussions across the PC gaming hardware industry, EVGA isn’t just dropping Nvidia - it also has no plans to move into creating GPUs with either AMD or Intel, Nvidia’s two key rivals. Instead, the company, which is well-known for making high-quality cards at reasonable prices, will quit the GPU business entirely.


The news was delivered today by a small number of hardware specialist media in various detailed reports, the best of which can be found over at the brilliant GamersNexus on YouTube (and embedded below). These outlets were directly briefed by EVGA, which confirmed that despite building prototype and test cards based on Nvidia’s upcoming 40-series GPUs, it wouldn’t be proceeding with those products - or any further Nvidia products.

That's according to PlayStation's SVP of platform experience, Hideaki Nishino, speaking in the latest episode of the Official PlayStation Podcast (jump to the 29:10 mark). "PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2," he explained in answer to a question from the host, "because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience". 


Elaborating further, Nishino claimed the new elements of the PVSR2 hardware - inside-out tracking and eye-tracking, 3D audio, a 4K HDR display, and its controller with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback - meant "developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's Street Fighter 6 closed beta announcement, Capcom has now revealed the full 18-strong character roster coming to the fighting series' latest instalment on launch day.


Previously, Capcom had confirmed 11 of the characters set to be playable in Street Fighter 6, offering a mix of familiar faces and brand-new additions. The iconic likes of Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, and Guile were all confirmed to be in, alongside more recent additions Juri and Luke. And as for newcomers, "self-styled Chinatown peacekeeper" Jamie and "devoted student to Bushinryu" Kimberly were both confirmed to be along for the ride.


As of today, though, that earlier 11-strong line-up has seen seven more additions, with Capcom having now announced Street Fighter 6's full launch day roster. Series stalwarts Zangief, Cammy, and Dee Jay are all present and correct, and the list of newcomers is complete with Manon, Marisa, Lily, and JP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's good news for PlayStation-owning fans of developer Team Cherry's sublime Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.


Hollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it'll offer a twist on its predecessor's non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.

Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I'm still not sure if he's talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project L — the 2 vs 2 fighting game lined up as industry giant Riot Games' next big release — is still a ways out. There’s no release date yet, only a handful of characters, and via our last major update we know the team have only just locked in the foundational gameplay and have moved onto full-on feature and character creation. The reality of people jumping on stage to play Project L for money is still a distant vision. However, does this mean Riot Games haven’t been setting up the groundwork? No way mate - I certainly didn’t think so.
As such, since I was in Sweden for the LEC Summer Finals where the best European teams were battling it out in top-of-class League of Legends, I thought it best to do some digging. Sitting across from me in a curtained interview room was senior director of esports for the EU Alberto Guerrero, who was the perfect person to question about what their plans were for Riot's yet-to-be-release fighting game, what they had done in this primordial pre-release stage, and what special stuff they had in mind for the Fighting game community (FGC).
But why should anyone care? Sure Riot Games is working on its fighting game right now, but why does its future esports vision actually matter to those who play fighting games right now? Well, it doesn't take a fortune teller to predict that Project L will send shockwaves across the genre. It's free to play, which means it'll have a strong initial base, and with pre-existing Riot Games fans — and Riot Games money — behind it, how it stands on the big stage will likely influence or outright alter how other developers and publishers approach their own titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly eight years in development, an ambitious VR mod for Valve's seminal shooter Half-Life 2 finally launches on Steam today as a public beta.


Created by a group of modders going by the name of Source VR Mod Team, Half-Life 2: VR Mod has had a bit of a bumpy journey to release. Eurogamer first reported on the project back in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra in 2013. Some time after, it disappeared into what the team recently called "its own kind of development hell", almost being abandoned, but eventually re-emerged in 2021.


The wait continued until last month, when Source VR Mod Team announced that, thanks to a "new influx of team members [that] revitalised" development, the Half-Life 2: VR project was poised to release, and that day is now here.

Arktoberfest is the first big event to come to Lost Ark in the West that wasn't in the original Korean and Russian version of the game.

In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omega Strikers has just been announced! Odyssey Interactive has just shown off its premier title, with former staff from a range of industry giants including Riot Games among senior staff. A 3v3 competitive sports x fighting game, you can apply to enter the closed beta right now.
While only playable on the PC right now, news of future mobile and console versions are apparently on the way. So if you like the look of the trailer below, but the sight of a keyboard deeply frightens you, hopefully the wait shouldn’t be that bad.
The gameplay is all about two teams of three smashing eachother off the arena in order to clear the path for a shot on goal. It’s like a sci-fi version of what you wish football really was when you were a teen, where you could just smash into the lad who actually spent his free time doing exercise and footy practice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What would the gaming community be like without Twitter? No, wait, don’t sarcastically post that Simpsons “A World Without Lawyers” clip in response – I’m serious. A lot of us grouse and gripe about it, but as a platform, it’s become hugely important to gaming and hardcore gamers. I’d even go so far as to say that it’s indispensable.
Fans use it to celebrate and complain. Developers and media form little Twitter bubbles where they socialize and hang out. During covid lockdowns, Twitter became a primary networking and communication tool, and, more importantly, a way to catch up with people for vital sanity-checks. The gaming news cycle is now practically built around Twitter; if you want the news first, that’s where you’ll go. If we’re lucky, the hot tweet will point you to the full write-up on VG247. Twitter has changed how the gaming industry functions. 
And Twitter knows it, too. The company believes that 71% of Twitter users play games, and 47% of its user base see watching people play games on platforms like Twitch as a form of entertainment. Gaming is massive on the platform, with the first half of 2022 seeing 1.5 billion Tweets on gaming topics – a new record, mapping to about 96 hot takes a second. That’s a whole lot of wrong opinions and console warring. As a result, it’s not a surprise to hear where Twitter sees itself.

        <updated>2022-09-16T14:02:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a vital piece of the Final Fantasy 7 lore and universe, it always seemed inevitable that Square Enix would somehow re-release Crisis Core, the FF7 prequel that first released for PSP in 2007. The release, which FF7 steward Tetsuya Nomura says promoted internal discussion about whether it’d qualify as a remake or a remaster, does sort of defy categorization – but now I’ve played it for myself, I’m going to try anyway.

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion is a remaster. It’s perhaps not quite ‘more than a remaster’, as Square Enix has suggested, but it’s a bloody impressive run at tidying up and improving a game that was on a handheld console that, ultimately, was less powerful than the PS2. 

In stills, Crisis Core definitely does look like more than a remaster, though. What you have here is low-key PS4 quality character models that wouldn’t look out of place in FF7 Remake proper dropped into the PSP game. In many cases, it seems like Square Enix has made clever use of the FF7 Remake asset – directly using some models and textures from that game, just back-porting them to this 2007 title. In stills, and even sometimes in motion in combat, it looks pretty damn impeccable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned this week that brilliant GameCube role-playing game Tales of Symphonia was getting a re-release on modern consoles - but fans have now expressed disappointment at the fact it will run at a locked 30fps. 


The detail, listed on the game's new Japanese website, has raised eyebrows since Symphonia on GameCube was presented in largely 60fps (with 30fps only for the world map).


Instead, this new remaster features a blanket 1080p 30fps across all three platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's prolific, and then there's Team Ninja. No sooner had I wrapped up an evening with the demo of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty - a demo that's just gone live to all on PlayStation 5 - than the news broke of another in its long line of action games with Rise of the Ronin. And all this before I've even had the chance to finish the team's take on Final Fantasy, Strangers of Paradise, or even managed to fully get my head around what exactly Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is. 


There's plenty that's familiar in Wo Long, though, both from the Nioh games it builds upon - themselves a pair of hard-edged, deeply enjoyable spins on the action RPG template laid out by FromSoft's Souls games - and Koei Tecmo's broader history with the Three Kingdoms periods. Because, in the simplest terms possible, Wo Long is Nioh transposed to the mythology and legends of third century China. 


It's more than that, though, with an all-new approach to combat and an entirely different feel to it all. Nioh was a game of studied composure, and one that rewarded consideration in your attacks. Wo Long, on the other hand, flows like water and invites you to lose yourself in its combat, pulling you through its stages with a momentum quite unlike that which you'd associate with your typical Soulslike. It's not quite a musou - that brand of crowd-clearing action that Koei Tecmo has made a craft of over the past 20 years - but it weaves in some ideas with its morale system that sees you conquering the map to earn more power.  The end result is something that feels surprisingly novel.

The mod in question comes from Jack Humbert on Nexus Mods (via PC Gamer). Named 'Let there be flight', this mod "enables a configurable flight system for all vehicles with custom thruster models, visual & sound effects, and animations."


This adds something to Cyberpunk 2077 that many had hoped would have been included on the game's initial release almost two years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Remy of Ratatouille once said, "if you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff." Disney Dreamlight Valley is surprisingly good stuff, and I'm going to keep reaching for more and more plates until someone begs that I put it down.
I'm likely not alone in regards to this sentiment, either, with Disney Dreamlight Valley having raked in over 1 million players since launching ten days ago into early access. The news was shared directly via the game's Twitter account, reading "We're overjoyed to see you discover what it means to #LiveMagically. Thank you for your excitement, feedback and sharing the game with your friends. This is just the beginning!"
Before anyone accuses me of being a Disney adult who'd obviously be all over this game, I've never been massively into Disney whatsoever. Sure, I've got an affinity towards borderline-cult classics such as Ratatouille, but I frankly couldn't care less about things like Frozen and Tangled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve not even known about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty –  the next game from the creators of Nioh – for that long. It was announced back at Xbox and Bethesda's Games Showcase in June, and immediately caught the eye of everyone that’s got even a passing love for all things hardcore action-RPG.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is the new action title from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo (no, not Rise of the Ronin – we’re not going to see that for another few years yet), and in a series of trailers, it demonstrated how it immediately intends to separate itself from the developer’s previous Nioh games. 
There’s a jump button! There are no stances! You cannot ki pulse! It’s much quicker! It’s set in China instead of Japan! But it’s hard to divine any of what this actually means for the game, really, from trailers – no matter how flashy and well put-together they are. In a hands-on with the game’s first demo, though, I’ve been able to try it all out for myself… and let me tell you, the difference is as vast and important as FromSoftware’s was in the jump from Dark Souls to Bloodborne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a "GeForce Beyond" show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

We already knew that the new game, set in the Three Kingdoms-era of China's dynastic history, was set to receive a demo "in the near future", but thanks to the Tokyo Game Show, we can all enjoy it right now!
You need to be quick, though: the test isn't sticking around for long (likley because you need to be online at all times to enjoy it). Don't worry if you've not got an active Xbox Live or PS+ membership, though; the multiplayer option in this demo does not require a paid membership to the online services of each platform, per the publisher.

I'm quite surprised more hasn't been made about this, given her influence, but now you know. Her 2006 stratospheric chart topper, Irreplaceable, was at one point all about Assassin's Creed - a game she played an early build of and loved so much she simply had to pen a song about it, even before it hit stores.
The song, which went on to the biggest tune of 2007 in the US, originally talked about how the star loved Assassin's Creed so much that it could never be replaced by another game. In a strange turn of events, however, Beyoncé has a phobia of flags, so was quite shocked to see so many in the game when she played it just prior to the release of Irreplaceable. This shocking twist resulted in the song hastily being rewritten to focus on a relationship, and the original song never saw the light of day.
Bizarrely, she also has an irrational dislike of first-party PlayStation exclusives.

Your adventure unfolds by making decisions using cards which represent allies, resources, and events, which often have weird and surprising consequences. Weirdly, the game it most reminds me of is Townscaper: throw pieces together, uncertain what will happen, then be surprised and delighted what the system produces.

Splicing, did you say? Well, yes, yes I did! In Let's Build a Zoo, players can quite literally mix things up during any given playthrough.

Spencer appeared on CNBC overnight and was questioned over Sony's recent comments on the deal - including pushback from PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who previously branded Microsoft's reassurances around the future of Call of Duty as "inadequate". 


When asked whether Microsoft was prepared to go further than its recently-stated pledge - to keep COD on PlayStation for several more years - and perhaps promise it would remain on PlayStation in perpetuity, Spencer said his expectation was that Xbox would "continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation and other places".

It’s up to you to get to the bottom of what Mr. Peterson is hiding in Hello Neighbor 2, and on a much wider scope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always thought each of the sixteen colossi in Shadow Of The Colossus is kinda cute in their own special way. There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, 
here's our archive.
Apparently, I'm drawn to doing mundane things. Perhaps I'm inherently boring. I just can't get enough of tidying up, though, or folding someone's clothes, or washing them. Or cleaning the toilet, and I never thought I'd write that. And I know that isn't really the point of Arcade Paradise - the point is growing an arcade out the back - but it's the mundane half of the game in the laundrette that really balances me, and the game, out. Beautiful monotony - something to gently latch a restless mind onto and occupy my hands with.

I’ve always been a strong supporter of Street Fighter 5, and the fact that it got significantly better over time... but lord knows, the difference between SF5 and SF6 is night and day.

I’ve already played Street Fighter 6, of course. But this new sit-down, with a Tokyo Game Show build of the game, is a slightly updated and different build to the one I spent an hour or so with before. Here’s what’s new this time around:

I want to start out with what might seem like the least consequential piece of this updated build – the new commentators. And, well… I’m impressed? Commentary in video games is, of course, always a bit of a mixed bag. It repeats itself, it becomes stale, and it is often the subject of memes (especially in traditional sports games). But Street Fighter 6 has a canny solution to these ills – and it just might work.

It represents a massive course-correction from the controversial mis-steps of SFV, but it hasn’t jettisoned everything from the previous game: everything salvageable has been iterated and improved upon, resulting in a blend of SF4, SF5, and a breadth of new ideas.
Alex’s hands-on session with the Tokyo Game Show build focused on four newly revealed characters: the powerful but unwieldy Guile, for starters. Juri, whose SF6 incarnation is a refinement on her SF5 version but with some of her fan-favourite moveset brought in from SF4. Kimberly, an entirely new character for SF6 but with strong links to the wider Capcom lore.
And, lastly, Ken Masters; resplendent here in his “she’s turned the weans against us” era garb. Despite the divorcee-chic, though, it’s still the same old Ken: if he was your main in 1991, he’ll feel like being right back home again. Assuming she didn’t get the house.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision and Infinity Ward showed off the multiplayer portion of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 today ahead of the open beta, which kicks off tomorrow.
One multiplayer feature the developers showed off was swimming and Aquatic Combat. Instead of dying when hitting the water like in previous games,  action now occurs above, on, and in water. Various elements will be present such as currents and waves, and the water can be clean, murky, polluted, or have debris. 
In the open beta, maps with water will showcase these enhancements, and you can use water as a stealth or escape mechanism. You can even change your stance or sprint and look down to plunge underwater. If you fire underwater using sidearms and certain equipment, your weapon’s projectile will be affected by the increased density, so you may need to change your aim. You will also need to pay special attention to Tactical items, and you may need to try all-new strategies when attacking boats, enemies below the water’s surface, or when you’re avoiding or deploying an explosive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outer Wilds, the stellar time loop adventure - and Eurogamer Game of the Year 2019 - from developer Mobius Digital, has just received a next-gen upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Outer Wilds, if you're unfamiliar, casts players as tentative space explorers, slinging them into a miniature solar system of bizarre planets, absolutely stuffed with secrets. There's little direction, only a breadcrumb trail of clues hinting at a much larger mystery, and it all gradually opens out into glorious puzzle box, as ingenious as it is hauntig. And that's even before you start to grapple with the ramifications of the solar system resetting itself every 20 minutes.


It's great, then, but while Outer Wilds has technically been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S before now via backward compatibility, "playing...was not recommended because players could run into sections that weren’t optimised for the next-gen consoles, and encounter other backwards compatibility issues such as controller input lag" - as Mobius explains in a new post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has shared more details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak's next free Title Update, which will introduce the likes of the Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos when it comes to Switch and PC on 29th September.


When Capcom previously discussed Title Update 2 at the end of last month, it confirmed that monster variant Flaming Espinas would be one ofits new additions. It's now announced two additional variants for the release - the aforementioned Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos - both appering in its latest update trailer.


There's not much information about the Violet Mizutsune just yet, but the Risen Chameleos is described as an Elder Dragon that has "overcome the affliction by achieving symbiosis with the Qurio, gaining great strength and new abilities". As such, it "poses an even greater danger than when they were still under the influence of the affliction" - so tread carefully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia - the striking multi-character survival horror from acclaimed developer Santa Ragione - finally has a release date, and will be inviting PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players into its ever-shifting labyrinth on 27th October.


We're big fans of Santa Ragione's previous work, which includes MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, around these parts, and Saturnalia sounds just as intriguing. It's a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.


The goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following tonight's big Call of Duty blowout we finally have a release date for the much-anticipated Warzone 2.0 - plus we've plenty more details on what to expect. 


Warzone 2.0 is set to launch on 16th November, some two weeks after the launch of Modern Warfare 2 on 28th October. The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It'll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone's take on Escape from Tarkov. 


Like other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.

Announced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


The ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales' brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Norco, the acclaimed Southern gothic adventure from developer Geography of Robots, will be making the jump from PC to PlayStation and Xbox next month, arriving on 20th October.


Norco unfolds in the "sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps" of a surreal, future South Louisiana, where players embark on a quest to find their brother, Blake - missing after the death of their mother.


What follows is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure, but one that aims in all sorts of directions, with Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell somewhat futilely summing it up as a "text-adventure, turn-based party battler, boat-navigating... poem... puzzler?" in his review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[League of Legends is an esports mountain, at this point. Over the years since Western professional gaming's primordial days, it has broken through and risen through tectonic shifts in the global scene, eventually towering over the majority of its competitors both within its genre – and without. It has even reached the lofty heights required for your mum or dad to have heard about it.There's a good chance that if you have a sister, she's dated a mid-laner, god help her. Walking around town with a Fnatic or Evil Geniuses t-shirt can, in certain places, elicit a similar reaction that a football (real or American) jersey can. If I see a zoomer in an NA team's merch, I'm likely to laugh at them. If I see someone in old-school Shalke attire, I'm liable to french kiss them.
But, those plates buried beneath this world of competitive video games keep grinding, resulting in Riot Games spreading its ever growing influence to new pastures that its crown-title simply cannot reach. Valorant has erupted in popularity since its release, with fans and players of its one most notable competitor (CS:GO) jumping ship and leaving only the loyal behind. Wild Rift, the League of Legends mobile game, appears to be building to similar heights, while  Legends of Runeterra is cutting out its own audience among hardcore card duelists. This once lone, daunting mountain has found itself a range of familial peaks.
This is, obviously, great for Riot and its base – but with titles like Project L and the distant Riot MMO on the way, what is the role of League of Legends in this modern landscape? Is it still as important, as paramount to the success of Riot esports? Is it as shiny as it used to be, surrounded by fresher, growing games?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been some time since the launch of World of Warcraft Classic’s Wrath of the Lich King pre-patch, an update which saw many of the popular servers, including fresh servers meant to give new and old players a totally green experience, suffering from some serious queue times that made actually jumping in and playing the game incredibly difficult. Now, Blizzard has put out a statement, but the consequences of their actions (or inaction) are starting to be felt.
This statement, released on the Blizzard forums around the time when queues were really horrendous, covers the issue and provides some context for the problem. In terms of solutions, Blizzard halted character creation and transferring to badly-affected mega servers, and locked them down “indefinitely”. This essentially stopped an increased influx of players making the queues worse, which when combined with free transfers off realms has appeared to curb the problem somewhat. 
However, even now, certain mega servers still retain large queues, especially once school and work hours come to a close and players return home for some dungeon grinding, or farming honor in continuous Alterac Valley runs. In the aforementioned post, it’s stated that “we need more folks to move”, but that’s unlikely to happen with certain crowds of Classic WoW players — especially on fresh servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're back again this week for another Eurogamer Newscast, focusing on the recent Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play, plus the week's big news on the Yakuza franchise and what's next from Xbox Game Pass. It's been a busy week - full of Zelda, Pikmin, God of War and Yakuza 8 - but some corners of the internet are disappointed.


True, we didn't see some of the things we had expected might materialise. This week was not when we saw Wind Waker on Switch, Silent Hill on PlayStation, or got some kind of assurance Nintendo remembered what Metroid even was. But that's not to say there isn't plenty to look forward to.

Join Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan for our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom theories, thoughts on new Switch hardware, and our expert opinion on where to start with Yakuza.

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games' pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A hot new trailer for Street Fighter 6 was just dropped during Capcom’s Tokyo Game Show live stream, giving us a look at several returning world warriors, the battle hub, character creation in the single player mode, and the return of good ol’ fashioned car vandalism.
You can watch the trailer embedded below, which goes through each of the significant reveals in detail. As far as an update on Capcom’s next big fighter goes, this is a massive drop. However, with Ken looking a bit more grizzled rather than depressed, it does put the homeless Ken theories on a knives’ edge.
Let's start with the characters. Blanka, Honda, Dhalsim and Ken were all revealed briefly in the trailer, with a quick montage of some of their special moves, supers, and presence in the story mode hastily presented to us in Street Fighter 6’s flashy hip-hop inspired style. It’s hard to tell, but a mix of recognisable moves as well as a few new ones can be seen, which is obviously good news for series veterans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony says it "welcomes the announcement" by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority that it will further investigate Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In a statement to GamesIndustry.Biz, the platform holder said that "by giving Microsoft control of Activision games like Call of Duty, this deal would have major negative implications for gamers and the future of the gaming industry".


"We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality gaming experience," Sony continued, "and we appreciate the CMA's focus on protecting gamers."

The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it's down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you'll have to move fast to pick this one up...

What exactly these powers were was never disclosed, with Rose revealing that "even Chris" didn't know the full extent of what she could do thanks to her brush with the megamycete. 


However, a new trailer for Village's The Winter's Expansion DLC has shown off more from its new story, Shadows of Rose, including what these powers are.


Shared as part of Capcom's Tokyo Game Show presentation, this trailer reveals that Rose is actually able to freeze her enemies. So, very name appropriate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement that a remastered version of GoldenEye 007 is heading to Xbox was met with cheers – rightly, given it’s one of the best games of all time. Then the cheers gave way to confusion, and disappointment, as it was confirmed that the version of the game releasing on Xbox consoles won’t have online multiplayer – only the classic split-screen. 
In a weird twist, the Nintendo Switch version will have online play – but that release is basically an emulated version of the N64 release rather than a true remaster. It’s all a bit of a mess, and a bit of a disappointment. GoldenEye’s multiplayer is undoubtedly its most famous feature, and while it absolutely will forever be at its best when you’re crowded around a single screen – I also feel like online is a bit of a must in the year of our lord 2022. 

If you want to play GoldenEye multiplayer on Xbox, however, this is an option – and it’s been available since 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

The idea was that given there are over 1000 customisation items in MCC which were added over the years, it could be overwhelming for new players or those who only hop into the game occasionally.

Today, during a Tokyo Games Show livestream, Capcom said it had been working on securing a last-gen version of the game as well - and it had done so, but only for PS4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an interview with the team behind Plasma. Sadly, I listened back to the transcript and it's fifteen minutes of me laughing with delight, while heavy aircraft are clearly going through maneuvers overhead. No matter. Plasma is dizzyingly complex, but very easy to explain. It's an engineering sandbox game. You make stuff in a 3D world using pre-made parts and simplified code, and then you can share it with other people.


What kind of stuff? The team isn't sure - as in, they aren't sure where the boundaries are. People are going to make dioramas and games and working Babbage engines no doubt. Over the course of my interview I saw a working Pong machine, with a screen to play the game on and a decent run at the classic Pong cabinet. I saw a bunny robot with an emoji face and massive feet that kept falling over. I saw an articulated hand the size of a house that moved between waving and giving me a brisk thumbs-up. When doesn't that add something to your day? Oh yes, and a horrible robot spider that had basic player-seeking capabilities. 


All of this in a 3D world with gentle hills, blue skies and green grass. But how does it work? To answer this I was shown a little remote control car that could be steered with a joypad. And then the developers made a second car, shaping basic blocks, putting on an engine and wheels and a device for programming steering, and then disappearing into a sort of drag-and-drop code space in which you can cobble together inputs and outputs, and tweak endlessly if that's your thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The news of the cancellation of Halo Infinite's campaign co-op split-screen option has been frustrating - not least because I was looking forward to playing it with my son, just as I have with all prior Halo titles supporting the feature. The fact that 343 Industries isn't supporting it is all the more confusing because right now at least, it's possible to glitch your way into split-screen campaign co-op for up to four players. It's true that the feature is not without its bugs, but in my experience, these are relatively minor and it's possible to play through the entire campaign in split-screen mode. Adding to the sense of disappointment is how close 343 has got to finalising this feature - and it plays brilliantly.


To fully understand the story, we need to go back to 2017 when then-343 Industries head Bonnie Ross addressed the lack of split-screen campaign co-op in Halo 5, making this comment during the 2017 DICE summit: "When we didn't put split-screen in with Halo 5, I think it's incredibly painful for the community - and for us. It erodes trust with the community, as the community is part of our world building... I would say for any FPS going forward, we will always have split-screen."


The situation changed a couple of weeks ago when 343's head of creative, Joseph Staten announced the cancellation of the feature, suggesting that - to put it bluntly - finite resources were better deployed elsewhere: "We had to make the difficult decision not to ship campaign split-screen co-op and take the resources we would use on that and go after this list and all these other things."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in November I wrote up a list of 25 things I would 3D print.
Let's revisit the list and see how things have developed.
Stuff I won't print

Some kind of 45° leaning prong to dry bottles and flasks on
A tea tray and coasters
Small tins to keep loose-leaf tea in
It was pointed out to me that you can't safely print things to store food in
with most materials, as their porous/layered nature facilitates the growth of
bacteria. So, I'll rule out those items.
A vinyl record.


The size of the grooves in a vinyl record are smaller than conventional FDM
printers can achieve.
Things I've printed
a replacement prop arm/foot for my computer keyboard


Someone has modelled the exact part I need, and it worked great:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new update for the Xbox app on PC has added official integration of website HowLongToBeat.

If you haven't used it before, HowLongToBeat is a community run website where people can log how long it took them to beat a certain game. The times are then averaged to provide a rough estimate of the game's expected length.

It's by no means sound scientifically, but it's a nifty way of ballparking how much time you might need to finish a game's story before you commit to playing (or buying) it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night I got through two whole districts with almost no health, and no prospects. An early boss had whittled me down to almost nothing, so I lurched into the eternal night thinking - four health? This won't last long. For comparison, I start with 300 health, and that's rarely enough. But something happened. The City surprised me. I had a sort of unlikely cyberpunk cup run. Two whole districts on four health. I'm still thinking about it.
City Wars: Tokyo Reign is the kind of game that surprises me. It surprises me constantly, with great roguelite runs like last night's, in which I almost gave up but ended up travelling further than I could have imagined. It surprises me as I see a new wrinkle in its endless unspooling strategies, as I find a new synergy in its cards. It surprised me at the start by filling me with raw enthusiasm for a collectible card game that was also a roguelite - hardly a genre mash-up in short supply. It surprised me that I could take its initially daunting rules and make them my own. City Wars makes CCGs fresh again - it has for me, anyway. I really hope you'll play it too.
So let's get the roguelite stuff out of the way. It's a cyberpunk city filled with alleyways and midnight horrors. You choose a class and then get a randomised loadout of cards from your growing collection, a gun that works as a stats modifier, and a charm that gives you a perk of some kind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short while ago, I played Kirby’s Dream Buffet. Following the announcement of the game, I was completely ecstatic. You’re telling me they’re putting my favourite pink puff ball into what, essentially, looks like a tasty version of Fall Guys? And it’s going to be co-op? And it’s on the Switch!?
I was ready to make Kirby’s Dream Buffet one of my games of choice at gatherings, placing it on the same pedestal as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. However, when I actually got my hands on the game, I was left disappointed.
The co-op features that I anticipated were missing. Kirby’s Dream Land felt limited, only allowing for two-player local co-op. Online, I could play with three more friends, but they would then need to buy the game – as well as have their own Switch device to hand. I had my qualms with the game outside of this, which landed a 2/5 in my review, but it was the lack of four-player local co-op that, to me, made the entire premise of the game feel a little redundant.

Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile was only recently announced, but eager players saw that Android pre-registrations have opened on the Google Play Store. Clicking the button simply means you can pre-install it once it goes live, which is helpful in cases where the game is rolling out gradually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Call of Duty fans wait for Activision to reveal the future of the franchise later today, some players have already been diving into the settings of the recent Modern Warfare 2 beta to spot new details. 


The beta, which is set to go live tomorrow evening, is available to preload now for those who have pre-ordered the game. 


The most notable finding has been the option to adjust the "3rd Person Field of View," which implies that the game will feature a third-person game mode, as well as an FOV slider on console.

Indeed, a Switch port of anything Yakuza is unlikely to happen, according to Ryu Ga Gotoku Sydido head Masayoshi Yokoyama.

Yokoyama made the statement in an interview with GameSpot yesterday and explained why the studio was reluctant to put Yakuza on Switch.

PowerWash Simulator is a game about cleaning things - cars, helicopters, bungalows - that quickly becomes a compulsion. You complete jobs to upgrade your powerwash machine, then take on progressively bigger challenges. 


Pretty soon you're hosing down whole skate parks, fairground rides, and a particularly grubby set of public toilets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley is a glittering life simulator in which you — having somehow slipped out of the real world into a kind of Disney-sponsored coma — find yourself living alongside all of your favourite intellectual property. Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

This means that two of the best anime fighters out right now are both available for those with a Game Pass sub, easily accessible for those who want to learn some combos.
While both aren't particularly new games, with Strive being around a year old and Cross Tag Battle having been hanging around for roughly 3 years now, they both have existing online communities that are bound to get a healthy injection of new fresh players thanks to both opening up to the Game Pass crowd.
Recently this year, both games were present at Evo 2022. Guilty Gear Stive had a second season of DLC characters announced alongside Bridget, a returning character from the series' past who was set live only days following their showing at the tournament. Unfortunately, Cross Tag Battle didn't get any significant announcements along the same line.

Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.
"So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we're going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers," commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. "So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it's a 27-hour downtime that we're planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. 
"We'll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There's also a couple of things that we'll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We'll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accessibility in video games has been a topic of growing popularity over the past few years. With both indie developers and mainstream companies bringing new standards of accessibility to the forefront of the gaming industry, there is steady change towards a more inclusive environment for all kinds of players. However, one group that has often been neglected is the blind and visually impaired gaming community. 


Creating games that are accessible to blind players often requires developers to work their way from the ground up, as with The Last of Us Part 2, or build upon what they have already created, in the way that Sea of Thieves handled its accessibility options. 



Sometimes, however, players take matters into their own hands. This is the story of Hearthstone Access, the community around it and how it was brought into existence by the work of just one individual, known only as GuideDev.

Now, it's time for the Tokyo Game Show with even more exciting announcements, and already, it looks like 2023 is shaping up to be a good year for games.
As a part of the Tokyo Game Show, which runs from September 15 to September 19, Xbox will have its own livestream. There's already been a lot to hear from Microsoft this past year, having hosted its own rather lively Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase in June this year. We got a long, hard look at Starfield and its thousands of planets, plus a further look at exciting titles like Redfall, Forza Motorsport, and Minecraft Legends.
The show goes on, though, and we can anticipate even more news from Xbox today!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of today's Call of Duty: Next multiplayer showcase event, Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward finally unveiled one of the biggest new additions in the upcoming shooter: Gunsmith 2.0. The Gunsmith system, introduced in the 2019 Modern Warfare, was one of its defining features.
It allowed players to unlock an unprecedented number of attachments and experiment with weapon modifications to a level only seen in milsim shooters. That system has been revamped for Modern Warfare 2, and the developer explained what its goals are in a new video.
There are two key pillars to Gunsmith 2.0, which resemble the way Escape from Tarkov handles weapon creation. The first is Weapon Platforms, which encompass all the different possible variants (SMG, DMR, AR, etc.) that are born from a single platform.

He said “it’s ICFP and I wanted to say the dominance relation has a beautiful set of equations … you can read all these algorithms how to compute this, but the concept is simple”.
This made me wonder: If the concept is simple and this formula is beautiful – shouldn’t this be sufficient for the Haskell programmer to obtain the dominator relation, without reading all those algorithms?
Before we start, we have to clarify the formula a bit: If a node is an entry node (no predecessors) then the…]]></summary>

But anyway. Let's talk about making this work!
git's SSH signing support is actually just it shelling out to ssh-keygen with a specific set of options, so let's go through an example of this with ssh-keygen. First, here's my certificate:
$ ssh-keygen -L -f id_aurora-cert.pub
id_aurora-cert.pub:

To Throw or not to throw
Here is our little toy language to analyze: It has variables, lambdas and applications, non-recursive (lazy) let bindings and, so that we have something to analyze, a way to throw and to catch exceptions:
type Var = String

data Exp
  = Var Var
  | Throw
  | Catch Exp
  | Lam Var Exp
  | App Exp Exp
  | Let Var Exp Exp

Given such an expression, we would like to know whether it might throw an exception. Such an analysis is easy to write: We traverse the syntax tree, remembering in the env which of the variables may throw an exception:

Sony's live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Harbour is the first member of the cast to be officially revealed (thanks The Hollywood Reporter) and he'll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who's helming the project.


Blomkamp will be directing from a script by Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), which dramatises an apparently true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver.

Eville


Eville is a multiplayer social deduction game from developer VestGames that's coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 11th October. It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.

Plazas and Promenades, which was announced back in August, brings a new pedestrianisation focus to developer Colossal Order's acclaimed city builder, giving players the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


Pedestrian Streets can be placed like any other road to create green city centres largely free of vehicles and pollution. These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years after its initial launch, EA's is making its enormously popular life sim The Sims 4 permanently free-to-play, beginning Tuesday, 18th October.


From that point onward, The Sims 4's base game (which is currently priced at £17.99/£19.99 USD) will be available to download at no cost across all platforms - that is, PC, Mac, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. There's no talk of pricing changes for the game's extensive DLC catalogue - which totals 12 Expansion Packs, 12 Game Packs, 18 Stuff Packs, and 15 Kit Packs at present - so it appears to be business as usual on that front for now.


In a post announcing today's news, EA said it will "continue to develop and release packs, kits and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future" following The Sims 4 base game's transition to free-to-play, with more on its future plans set to be shared in a special developer livestream airing on 18th October at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world games are good and everything, but sometimes they’re just too much. Whether you’re 100 hours into Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and only about 30% through the game, or chasing around Far Cry 6 clearing all the icons off your map, there’s just something about open world games that’s getting tiresome these days. Maybe it’s the proliferation of them – open world games are pretty much the biggest genre out there, right now – or maybe it’s the dwindling nature of our collective attention span. Either way, we’re finding it harder and harder to care. 

And Square Enix knows that. More specifically, Square Enix’s in-house development studio, Luminous Productions knows that. Coming off the back of Final Fantasy 15 (which, let’s face it, wasn’t really an open world game, now was it?), the studio has been keeping a close ear to the ground when it comes to player sentiment about open world games. And – though you may have only laughed at it because of a poorly-delivered trailer – Forspoken wants to do something a bit different with the open world genre to keep you more invested.
“Obviously, from our side, we're keeping an eye on what people are saying about open worlds and what the general feelings are in the industry right now,” says Forspoken co-director Takefumi Terada via Square Enix interpreter. “And so we are aware of the sentiment people feel towards [the genre].”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve paid any amount of attention to fighting game fans, influencers, or players over the past year, you’ll know Project L is the looming presence thundering towards us from the murky future. It’s the elephant in the room in the purest sense, a presence that every new release, every new announcement, and every new development in the genre is measured around.
The folks at Riot Games appear to understand the environment they’re walking into; R&D Projects that end up greenlit and pushed into the forefront. The first ever bit of news we ever saw with Project L revolved around the esteemed and experienced staff that were leading development, a strategy Riot had previously used before with Legends of Runeterra and Valorant, which championed big names in their respective genres. This, as it was obviously intended to do, made every 30+ year old buster with an arcade stick a little hot around the collar. Follow that up with announcements of free-to-play, great netcode, and a 2v2 format, and the pants came off.
But, while Riot may have the crowd with boxed copies of Street Fighter 4 hyped, it is arguably far more important for the long term success of Project L that it wins over the non-fighting game crowd. The League, Valorant, Runeterra and Wild Rift communities not only dwarf the FGC, but are most likely the first group of truly fresh players who’ll pick Riot's foray into fighting games up first, too. The big question on my mind regarding Project L right now is simply, 'do League of Legends players actually give a shit?'

Perhaps that's the in-game explanation for the odd fashion choices for Alear, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Return to Monkey Island's release next week, I sat down with series creator Ron Gilbert, co-writer Dave Grossman and art director Rex Crowle to discuss the series' surprise revival. It's a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool's Day announcement a few months ago. 
Speaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert's shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series' iconic distraction of "Look! A three-headed monkey". Apparently, this move works "every time".)
In addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears Arkane's Deathloop is set to release on Xbox consoles rather soon if a pre-order ad popping up on Xbox is any indication.
Spotted by reddit user Immediate_Exercise27, the store UI clearly shows a Deathloop pre-order card.
The only thing is, when you click the option, it takes you to a blank store page. Still, this means you can probably expect the game to be available sooner rather than later, as the PlayStation exclusivity period is almost up.

This test - and indeed our recent interview with Intel - came about in the wake of our AMD FSR 2.0 vs DLSS vs native rendering analysis, where we devised a gauntlet of image quality scenarios to really put these new technologies through their paces. We suggested to Intel that we'd love to put XeSS to the test in a similar way and the company answered the challenge, providing us with pre-release builds and a top-of-the-line Arc A770 GPU to test them on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early impressions for the PSVR 2 are out on the internet, thanks to Sony inviting a whole bunch of press and content creators to try out its next big step into the virtual reality battlefield. With goggles on and controllers in hand, several attendees travelled and wrote up their impressions, which we have decided to compile in one place here.
As such, if you’re curious about whether or not the PSVR 2 is making enough progress beyond its previous iteration, you can find a collection of diverse impressions below. Of course, we’ve credited and linked back to each piece, and we highly recommend you jump over and read them all if you’d like to know more!
First up, we have Ian Higton’s excellent write up of their impressions over at Eurogamer. In their extended impressions piece, they cover not only their thoughts on the hardware itself, but also VR titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village, and the enhanced edition of Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge. They kick off their piece with: “Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That's the word that keeps springing to mind when I try to sum up my time with PlayStation VR 2. As a fervent fan of VR for many years now, it's safe to say that my first hands-on experience with Sony's upcoming headset wowed my VR-loving socks off.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Mirage is pitched as almost a quasi-remake of the first Assassin’s Creed game: it takes place in a similar region, and will modernise much of its gameplay mechanics.
However, Mirage is a different beast, and by focusing on a single city and taking into account all the refinement and iteration that the series has enjoyed since 2007, it may end up playing more like a much younger and frankly criminally underappreciated entry in the series: 2014’s Unity, as I argue in the video above. 
Mirage occurs a couple of decades earlier than the events of Valhalla, and a couple of centuries earlier than the first game, but will essentially bridge the gap between the ancient world trilogy of sprawling RPGs that we’ve been enjoying since Origins, and the action-adventure games of the series’ past: bringing the franchise full circle, and providing a neat stepping stone from the post-Roman world of Eivor, and the Levantine world of Altaïr.

Along with finally getting its name revealed - Tears of the Kingdom - we also got some new footage. And where there is new footage, you can be sure that Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and I will not be far behind with our theories about what it all means for the next instalment in the Zelda series.
So, we have teamed up to bring you our thoughts on this new trailer below - and to discuss the little things you  may have missed on a first pass. Without further ado, let's get stuck in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a thrill it’s been to see GoldenEye 007 finally revealed to be making a return on Nintendo Switch and Xbox. Sure, it’s been rumored for a long time, but it was still one of the most electrifying announcements on a day that was, thanks to a Nintendo Direct and State of Play, pretty packed full of ‘em.

It was also an announcement that then gave way to questions and even a twinge of disappointment, as an Xbox version was confirmed – but it just wasn’t what we all thought it would be.

Let’s break it down. GoldenEye is coming to the ‘Nintendo Switch Online’ subscription service as one of many Nintendo 64 titles available on that service. It’s a standard NSO release, which means it’s playable so long as you have the right tier of NSO subscription, and is essentially an emulated N64 game rip, given tweaks and adjustments by Nintendo in order to make it run on Switch, and to handle extra features like online play.

As a fervent fan of VR for many years now, it's safe to say that my first hands-on experience with Sony's upcoming headset wowed my VR-loving socks off. This sleek and stylish unit was all I could have wanted for an upgraded PSVR headset and much, much more.
In terms of technological and visual quality, this feels like one of the more memorable generational console leaps. Experiencing the difference in visuals between the PSVR1 and the PSVR2 brought back memories of graduating to the sparkly, sharp, high-definition games of a PS3 after spending years playing games on the PS2 in standard definition.
Even the visuals afforded by my beefy PC VR rig seemed to pale in comparison to some of the wonders I witnessed whilst inside the PSVR2 and you can watch me breathlessly gush over it in the video below. There's around 40 minutes of PSVR2 information and impressions in there, including detailed close-ups of the kit, descriptions on how to calibrate the headset for eye-tracking and room-scale VR and beautiful 4K footage of the four game demos I played; Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge - Enhanced Edition
