        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost to the week one year since the last maintenance release, we can announce another maintenance release, now at version 0.0.17, of the RVowpalWabbit package. The CRAN maintainers kindly and politly pointed out that I was (cough, cough) apparently the last maintainer who had packages that set StagedInstall: no. Guilty as charged.
RVowpalWabbit is one the two packages; the other one will hopefully follow ‘shortly’. And while I long suspected linking aspects to drive this (this is an old package, newer R packaging of the awesome VowpalWabbit is in rvw, I was plain wrong here. The cause was an absolute path to an included dataset, computed in an example, which then gets serialized. As Tomas Kalibera suggested, we can replace the constant with a function and all is well. So here is 0.0.17.
As noted before, there is a newer package rvw based on the excellent GSoC 2018 and beyond work by Ivan Pavlov (mentored by James and myself) so if you are into VowpalWabbit from R go check it out.
CRANberries provides a summary of changes to the previous version. More information is on the RVowpalWabbit page. Issues and bugreports should go to the GitHub issue tracker.
If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now sponsor me at GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals.

All this comes via a listing, still live at the time of writing, on Japanese retailer Neowing's website - which, assuming its veracity (highly likely given the nature of the assets and details included), corroborates virtually all previous rumours circulating around the game in recent months.


First is the name, Need for Speed: Unbound, which tallies with a report from Insider Gaming at the end of September, as does Neowing's listed release date of 2nd December this year.

Inquisitor - Martyr is a Diablo-esque take on the Warhammer 40,000 universe, casting players as Inquisitors who must battle their way, either solo or with friends, through a "haunted fortress-monastery which hides a terrible secret from the past".


It features cover-based combat, four classes (Psyker, Crusader, Assassin, and Tech-Adept, with the new Sororitas class due at a later date), a procedurally generated mission system, skill trees, a wide range of weapons and vehicles, two-player local co-op on consoles - as well as four-player online multiplayer - and more.

To that end, the studio plans to host a Freelancer closed technical test for the rogue-like mode. In early November, the IO will selectively invite Hitman 3 players on Steam to put the mode through its paces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells, the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has expanded once more, this time introducing a free Boss Rush mode - and an assortment of related rewards for those with sufficient skills - for players on PC.


Boss Rush mode is accessed through a basement door in the Prisoner's Quarters and features four different stages to battle through. All four stages feature back-to-back bosses to defeat, one containing three bosses, another featuring five bosses, plus two more containing three and five enhanced bosses respectively. These enhanced bosses feature "more ways to kick your ass", including new limbs, healing powers, and even some friends to help them.


Each of the four challenges feature bosses randomly selected from three tiers (although players must have encountered them in Normal mode before they appear), with three-boss challenges starting with a boss from Tier 1, then moving on to Tier 2, then Tier 3. Five-boss challenges feature two Tier 1 bosses, two Tier 2 bosses, then a final boss from Tier 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[^ Stick around after the ads for some pristine 1440p footage and a discussion about Modern Warfare 2’s place in the modern era of shooters.


As infuriating exercises in being the severalth thing in a series but having the same title as the original go, the Modern Warfare reboot wasn’t half bad. We spent a bunch of time in the multiplayer beta for MW2 ahead of the full release at the end of this month, and found a solid (if a little muddled) Call of Duty game in there.


But we have to wonder: in a world far removed from the original Modern Warfare 2, which solidified CoD’s utter dominance of the 360 era back in 2009, what place does 2022’s MW2 multiplayer have in a crowded marketplace full of free-to-play competition?

In a recent Twitter thread (thanks, Nintendo Everything), adult game publisher Gamuzumi told fans it had heard back from Nintendo after facing an unexpected delay in the launch of its most recent title, Hot Tentacles Shooter.


According to Gamuzumi, which describes itself as a "boutique publisher focused on releasing mature or 'ecchi' [softcore hentai] titles", Nintendo has now ruled that games featuring topless anime women are no longer allowed.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between EA Originals and Koei Tecmo's Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series), transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom's Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan where up to three players can battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.


Omega Force - which has previous experience in the monster hunting genre, courtesy of its two Toukiden games - has now expanded on Wild Hearts' initial reveal with seven minutes of new, largely uninterrupted gameplay footage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soccer sim FIFA 23 has been given its first patch since the Day One update, but don’t expect to encounter any earth-shattering changes when you next take to the pitch. Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

Published by EA, the game takes place in a fantasy version of feudal Japan called Azuma, a region full of scenic meadows and rich bamboo forests. The area is being ravaged by formerly peaceful, nature-infused beasts called Kemono, which are now altering their environment at the cost of citizens’ lives.
Kemono can range from from plant-infused squirrels to the massive Kingtusk wild boar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Gotham Knights, Batman is dead. "Like, dead-dead," as WB Montreal put it during our preview, and in his place comes four sub-heroes: Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing and Red Hood. These are, barring any surprises, who you will play as in Gotham Knights. I played as three of them in the preview - Batgirl and Red Hood in early game scenarios, and Robin for a late-game mission and boss fight - and I can now say with confidence that they are… fine.


It's faint praise, and I'm loath to be too harsh on Gotham Knights when we're still a few weeks away from launch. But at the moment it's underwhelming, and underwhelming in terms of real substance, rather than technical performance - it looks nice enough and ran without any hiccups while we played over streaming platform Parsec. 


What's missing is a sense of conviction. The setup sees you making a base of the Belfrey, a clock tower hideout that'll be familiar to series fans, where you can mooch about and briefly chat with the other characters, swap between them, and launch missions or an exploration of the open world of Gotham City. Gotham looks quite good, but also a little muted next to the Gotham of Rocksteady's Arkham games - especially Arkham Knight - where that glorious, gothic maximalism is replaced with more of a mediumalism. The city's deep blacks seem more like faded browns, the rain doesn't fall as hard, there's no sense of sharpness, rankness, no distinctive air of criminal filth and grime, and with a kind of unnerving clarity to it all, like an old game that's been visually "remastered" by an AI, its atmosphere lost without its textured fog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG is getting a harrowing new event this October (as is New State) thanks to a spooky new Dead by Daylight crossover event on the horizon. As part of this new promotion, players of all three games will be able to net themselves some fancy new cosmetics, as well as take part in some exclusive events. Is this better than going outside and throwing chocolate at children? We’ll let you decide.
Lets start with PUBG players. As part of the event, battle royale heads will be able to earn 4 costumes and masks, 3 new backpack skins, a pan skin and a themed name plate between October 19 - December 7. These are all based on Dead by Daylight, so you’ll be able to rep a selection of your favourite killers as you drop into the firefight below.
In addition, there’s an exclusive Dead by Daylight hide and seek in-game web event that players can jump into in order to unlock some additional goodies. Four players can access it through the in-game lobby banner, where three survivors have to escape a killer in typical Dead by Daylight fashion: throwing objects and repairing generators in order to make their escape.

Assuming the Call of Duty development cycle goes according to plan, Advanced Warfare 2 will follow up Treyarch's game, which is the next game in the franchise after this year's Modern Warfare 2.
The news comes from a Ralph Valve report, who's a leaker with a proven track record when it comes to Call of Duty scoops. According to their report, the new Advanced Warfare will be built on the updated IW 9.0 engine - the same one that powers Modern Warfare 2, and Treyarch's unannounced game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Certain clever computer wizards have managed to jailbreak the PS5, albeit in a limited capacity where you’re only able to install software, but not launch it. Nonetheless, this limited jailbreak has allowed some out there to jump in and install the long dead but dearly missed PT onto their PS5 consoles. It’s just a shame they can’t actually boot it up and play it.
This jailbreak was released to the public by Twitter user Specter via a Github link. This jailbreak only works on PS5 consoles running the 4.03 firmware or lower, which would on be present on any PS5 that hasn't been updated past October 2021. As such, chances are the PS5 sitting next to you (if you’re lucky enough to have one) can't be jailbroken using this method.
However, if you are able to get the jailbreak working, you’re able to get into the PS5 debug menu and download various PS4 files on your system. This includes the mysterious PT, as shown by Twitter user Lance Mcdonald (see below), which was removed from sale years ago as a result of a fallout between Hideo Kojima and Konami, which resulted in the cancellation of the highly-anticipated Silent Hills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's first enthusiast-grade graphics cards are here - and on the eve of AMD and Nvidia's transition to a new generation, Team Blue has actually done well. The $289 Arc A750 and $329/$349 Arc A770 offer surprisingly strong 1080p performance, a unique mix of features and aggressive pricing that makes them well worth considering for a mid-range PC - for most gamers, anyway.  
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though. There's loads to cover here and time is short, so let's take a quick overview of the hardware, cover the software features we're most interested in and then get into the meat of this review: gaming benchmarks. 
We've got a brand new GPU test suite for late 2022, with a tranche of complete newcomers joining a remixed assortment of Digital Foundry favourites covering every major engine. It's a forward-looking test suite, with titles using modern APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan, which should give Intel a chance to demonstrate its strengths. Of course, we'll also be taking a look at performance in some classic 'banana skin' DX11 titles in our video review, where we expect Intel's first-generation Arc GPUs to have slightly more difficulty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn't a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.
Whether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond "perfectly enjoyable" into "thrilling", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

The role has instead gone to Jennifer Hale, who has voiced characters such as Commander Shephard in Mass Effect and Naomi Hunter in the Metal Gear Solid series, to name but a few.


In an interview with Game Informer, which features Bayonetta 3 as its cover this issue, director Yusuke Miyata explained that "overlapping circumstances" meant that Taylor was unable to reprise her role as Bayonetta. As such, Hale stepped in to take the place of the series' title role, with Miyata stating he felt she was a "good match for the character" (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

Now, you can drive Rocket League's most famous vehicle - the Octane - within Fortnite. As you'd expect, it behaves just as it would on a Rocket League pitch - able to boost to high speeds and rapidly climb up walls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man's Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA's Dead Space remake has raised eyebrows for its £70/$70 price point on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, compared to its £50/$60 cost on Steam. 


On Steam, its £50 price sits in line with other upcoming AAA launches, such as Gotham Knights, Sonic Frontiers, The Callisto Protocol, Hogwarts Legacy and Marvel's Midnight Suns.

On console, the price point for these games varies a little more. Sonic Frontiers is £50, Callisto Protocol is £55 and Hogwarts Legacy is £60, while Gotham Knights and Marvel's Midnight Suns are £65.

With this app in play, users will now be able to see all of the channel's offerings in Ultra HD thanks to its 4K HDR playback support (the PlayStation 4 version of the app was limited to 1080p).


"A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we're excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users," said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of product and design for Disney streaming (thanks, The Verge). "The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Nintendo’s presentation on Thursday, a poster for The Super Mario Bros. Movie has been released, and it’s jam-packed with the sort of easter eggs and curious details that the average punter might miss. And let’s face it, who has time to zoom into a Twitter post? Well, luckily for you, it’s our job to do that sort of thing so you don’t have to. So, here’s 7 things we found in the Mario poster that may give us some clues as to the upcoming film’s story:

The Antique Shop’s Pixelated Goods

Could this be a clue as to the Mario movie’s canonicity within the wider continuity of the games? I can’t believe I just typed that sentence with a straight face. But hear me out: on those shelves you can clearly see switch blocks and music boxes from Super Mario Bros 3. Is this an indication that the film considers the classic games to have happened in its timeline?

Between that time and now, the CMA will be conducting meetings with the main and third parties involved with this acquisition, issuing questionnaires and verifying the information provided.

Technology manufacturers will now be required to use USB-C charging ports in all smartphones and tablets sold in the region from 2024, and in laptops from 2026. Mice, keyboards, headphones are also included.


As previously reported, the UK decided to opt out out of being included in this initiative when it was first proposed, despite its aims to cut electronic waste and generally make things a bit easier for those with a drawer full of random Lightning cables,  micro-USB and mini-USB wires.

While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we'd discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we're now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there's something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks back a friend recommended Jonathan Crary's 24/7, a short, vital book I have just finished reading. I suspect a lot of it went over my head, but the basics are pretty simple. Crary, who is a professor of modern art and theory at Columbia, makes the case that the contemporary world's focus on an endless 24/7 treadmill of consumption and toil has made sleep the true enemy of capitalism. Sleep is the last place where you cannot be sold stuff, or made to work, and so capitalism must fight sleep, and it will probably be a fight to the death.


Crary takes this argument in a number of fascinating, alarming ways. What he doesn't mention - and I understand this, I guess - is a great-uncle of mine who used to own a turkey farm, and had heard that turkeys were so stupid that when the lights went off they thought the day was over. He rigged up a system in his turkey farm, a farm which clearly should have been shut down by the authorities, in which the lights continually went on and off, the theory being that the turkeys would age by a day each time this happened, and would be ready for market sooner. I don't need to add anything at this point, but I will: my great uncle was not a very nice man and should not be interpreted as the hero of this story.


Both of these things - Crary's illuminating book and the involuntary memory about a family member that it prompted - created what is basically the single least ideal mindset in which to experience Slime Rancher 2, which is out in early access at the moment and is taking over the world. Slime Rancher 2 is a thing of joy: exploration and curiosity delivered in thick, buttery pastels. But it is also the kind of horror that Crary would potentially identify as pure capitalist indoctrination - a game that people are exposed to rather than asked to play. I don't think that would be entirely fair, but everything about this game is contradictory and challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 became available less than 24 hours ago, and as expected, there have been some teething issues when it comes to accessing the game. This isn’t something we aren’t used to by any means, but experiencing queues of up to 40,000 players at once still saw me go to bed early rather than stick around to try and play.
That said, Blizzard has acknowledged the queue times for the free-to-play multiplayer title via Twitter. Mike Ybarra, president of Blizzard, tweeted that the team was working hard to fix the server issues, and that Blizzard was humbled to see the excitement of its players.
Later, however, Mike Ybarra followed up on his prior tweet by quoting it with, “Unfortunately, we are experiencing a mass DDoS attack on our servers. Teams are working hard to mitigate/manage. This is causing a lot of drop/connection issues.”

Players have reported unexpected server errors and difficulties joining Overwatch 2 games throughout the evening following today's free-to-play launch, with some claiming to be experiencing queues of as many as 40,000 other players.


An earlier tweet by Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra acknowledged today's server woes but gave no indication they might be the result of anything other that launch day teething troubles, only thanking players for their patience and pledging to "get [them] into the fun".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of former PlayStation exclusives have been ported to PC over the past two years, and Sony seem to see the benefit of doing more. Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation Studios, says that "Further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile and into live services, that's definitely a possibility for us."

Dusk Golem's comments were posted in a thread on ResetEra where members of the forum were discussing a recent report that Death Stranding 2 would be released on Stadia, which Dusk Golem debunked.

That's according to PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst who added that the firm's live-service games may be released earlier than one year post launch.
Various first-party titles have already been released on PC, and these include Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. In the PC pipeline is Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Uncharted: The Legacy Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've begun writing up my phd and, not for the first time, I'm pondering
issues of how best to represent things. Specifically, rewrite rules.
Here's one way of representing an example rewrite rule:
streamFilter g . streamFilter f = streamFilter (g . f)

This is a fairly succinct representation. It's sort-of Haskell, but not
quite. It's an equation. The left-hand side is a pattern: it's intended
to describe not one expression but a family of expressions that match.
The lower case individual letters g and f are free variables:
labelled placeholders within the pattern that can be referred to on the
right hand side. I haven't stipulated what defines a free variable and
what is a more concrete part of the pattern. It's kind-of Haskell, and
I've used the well-known operator . to represent the two…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tequila Works, the developer behind the likes of the sublime Rime and intriguing VR murder-mystery The Invisible Hours, has confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt will be going multiplatform next year.


Gylt, an enjoyably surreal horror yarn that follows the adventures of a young girl in search of her missing cousin, launched exclusively on Stadia back in 2019. And while Tequila Works did at one point suggest a multiplatform release might eventually be on the cards, it's remained resolutely Stadia-bound in the years since.


However, following last week's announcement that Google will be shutting down Stadia on 18th January next year - a move that prompted questions as to what might happen to the cloud gaming service's handful of remaining exclusives - Tequila Works has confirmed Gylt will finally be getting a multiplatform release some time in 2023.

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I've experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King's Row and Route 66, it's like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I'm not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński has announced he'll be stepping down from his joint-CEO role - a position he's held at the company for nearly 30 years - before the end of 2022.


"I am beginning a brand-new personal chapter at CD Projekt," Iwiński wrote in a statement shared following the company's latest investor meeting, "as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint-CEO role. By the end of 2022, I'll hand over my duties to my colleagues from the board."


"For me this is a huge moment," Iwiński continued. "I've been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognised developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by millions globally. Back when Michał Kiciński and I founded the company, I don't think either of us would have been able to imagine this incredible journey, not even in our wildest dreams."

This will be our first look at the film featuring the famous plumber who "travels through an underground labyrinth with his brother to save a captured princess."
The Super Mario Bros. movie was first announced back in 2018, but it wasn't until last year that we had official casting confirmation. Chris Pratt (Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy) will lend his voice to Mario with Charlie Day (Always Sunny in Philadelphia) voicing Luigi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has revealed Sony's first-party PlayStation releases will likely take "at least a year" to launch on PC, although live-service games might come sooner.


Sony initially confirmed it was exploring bringing its first-party PlayStation exclusives to PC in March 2020, announcing that Horizon Zero Dawn would lead the charge - although it said "releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn't necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC" and that it didn't have plans to follow Xbox's lead with day-and-date PC releases.


Since then, following the successful launch of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, the number of titles joining the platform has continued to grow. Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered have already made the jump, with Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: The Legacy Collection, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure confirmed to be on the way.

And that might (and should) include the PSP games. Because they objectively kick ass.

On the partnership and revelation of the TV adaptation, Piotr Babieno shares that, “Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together. My joy is even greater because two Polish companies are taking part in production, and a series will be created on the basis of our game.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Company of Heroes 3 will not arrive this November as originally planned. Sega and developer Relic Entertainment announced this afternoon that the strategy game is being pushed back to February 23 next year.
Considering this delay comes a little over a month away from the game's original release date, and follows a few rounds of public demos, media previews and closed tests - Relic has explained why the decision was made.
According to the developer, the extra time will be spent on polishing the overall experience, fine-tuning balance, improving performance and implementing key gameplay changes based on feedback collected from insiders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced a three-month delay to Company of Heroes 3, which will now arrive on 23rd February 2023. 


Announcing the hold-up this afternoon, Sega said Relic Entertainment's real-time strategy threequel was currently "not quite up to our players' or our own high standards", with "bugs to squash, pixels to polish, gameplay to adjust and feedback to address". 


On that last point, Sega says developer Relic is continuing to react to community feedback on improvements to the game's dynamic campaign map, a stronger visual focus on "grit and details" during battles, an overhauled light system, plus tweaks to the HUD and UI.

Hadn't heard of this," to "holy video game, Batman, this is the absolute business" in the space of a free demo. This is what I experienced with Flat Eye, a story-heavy management sim where you're in charge of a super-advanced gas station, where you harvest personal data from the port-a-loos, and feed the biological matter from those same toilets into your high-tech vending machine. Mmmmm. Flat Eye, the Next Fest demo for which you can download and play right now, is from Night Call devs Monkey Moon. I liked Night Call fine, but I really love the Flat Eye demo.

We only know about the release target because EA told investors that there's a new Need for Speed coming out this calendar year.
The first shot in what's sure to be a short hype campaign for the next Need for Speed, came in the form of a nondescript tweet from the official EA account to... the official Need for Speed account. "You think they're ready, @needforspeed?" it reads.

Alice Ruppert knows a lot more about horses than I do. She's been obsessed with them ever since she was a child. She would draw them, play games about them, and many years later she would eventually make games about them. 
How she got her horse-break in games makes for a great origin story. The way she tells it, she complained so much about bad horse representation in games that eventually someone gave her a job and told her to do better, and that's what she's doing now, making Horse Tales: Emerald Valley Ranch, which is coming out really soon.

A jury has decided the companies must pay $3750 to Catherine Alexander, who designed tattoos for pro wrestler Randy Orton, after their likenesses appeared on Orton's character in WWE 2K16, 17 and 18.


Alexander had pushed for a higher amount, including a share of profits from the games, Reuters reported. Still, the decision appears to mark a landmark judgement that may affect future usage rights in other games in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highest praise I can lay on Cookin' with Coolio: Five Star Meals at a One Star Price is that when I went to look for my copy the other day I realised I'd leant it out to someone and would probably never see it again.


This is the life of cook books, isn't it? When they aren't in the kitchen, getting splattered with hot sauce or providing a resting place for wooden spoons, they're loaned around, pages marked, moving between hungry friends: you must read this! You must make this!


Cookin' with Coolio is where my mind went when I woke up one morning last week and learned that Coolio had died. Being a 90s person, I think this news would always bum me out. But having read and loved Coolio's cook book, I'm ashamed to say it all struck a bit deeper. Over the following days when all these stories started to come out about how brilliant Coolio was - how kind, how thoughtful and perceptive and funny - none of that was really a surprise? Why? Because I had read Cookin' with Coolio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You didn't hear it from me first, but Overwatch 2 is not Overwatch 2. It is Overwatch 2.0, a free-to-play rejig of the celebrated 2016 hero shooter with rebalanced characters, a sprinkling of new faces, modes and maps, and a predictably tedious seasonal Battle Pass system whereby unlocks are either paid for or ground out through match XP. 


Spend an hour with it and, tuned-up visuals notwithstanding, you might struggle to notice any difference beyond the charmless new monetisation elements. There's the same delightful range of MOBA-ish abilities, the same awkward pivot between cultural archetype and dodgy stereotype in the character and cosmetic design, the same sunny ambience and brilliant tactical audio, and the same rousing premise of corpo-progressive Pixar Avengers murdering each other for possession of small wagons and courtyards.


Many of the game's headline new bits are still to be developed or added, including the majority of new heroes and various much-trumpeted Player versus AI modes. I've not had much time with what does exist: the review period began in mid-September, but Eurogamer's code arrived late last week, and my existing PS4 account hasn’t transferred over to the PC review build - obliging me to jump in as a First Time User and so, limiting my access to the game's already-tiny pool of pre-release players. But enough of my petulant fist-waving! I’ll have a full review in a week or so - here are some provisional notes from the trenches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[mrcal 2.2 (the release notes are available here). This release
contains lots of medium-important internal improvements, and is a result of



Heavy dogfooding. I use these tools a lot every day, and many things are
nicer, easier and work better in 2.2 than in 2.1

Not-yet-completed cool new functionality. Some of the required internal
improvements for the big new features are being released here.




The biggest single new feature in this release is the interactive graphical tool
for examining dense stereo results: accessed via mrcal-stereo --viz stereo.



The next pressing thing is improved documentation. The tour of mrcal is still a
good overview of some of the functionality that makes mrcal unique and far
better than traditional calibration tools. But it doesn't do a good job of
demonstrating how you would actually use mrcal to diagnose and handle common
calibration issues. I need to gather some releasable representative data, and
write docs around that.



Then I'm going to start finishing the big new features in the roadmap (these are
all already functional, but need polish):



Triangulation functions in the optimization loop for efficient
structure-from-motion

Support for non-central projection to remove a significant source of bias
present in very wide lenses

Improved projection uncertainty quantification to resolve accuracy and
performance issues in the current projection uncertainty method]]></summary>

The Dragon Never Sleeps as typical of
1980s science fiction: Cook is far better known for his Black
Company military fantasy series, this is one of his minor novels, and
it's only been intermittently in print.  But I'm dubious this would have
been published at all today.



First, the writing is awful.  It's choppy, cliched, awkward, and has no
rhythm or sense of beauty.  Here's a nearly random paragraph near the
beginning of the book as a sample:



XII Fulminata!  What the
    hell?  Was some malign force ranged against him?



    That was his most secret fear.  That somehow someone or something was
    using him the way he used so many others.


    "What mischief have you been up to, Kez Maefele?"



    "Staying alive in a hostile universe."



    "You've had more than your share of luck."



    "Perhaps luck had nothing to do with it, WarAvocat.  Till now."



    "Luck has run out.  The Ku Question has run its course.  The symbol is
    about to receive its final blow."

That's an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That's about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you'll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

Fans gathered earlier today to witness the final moments of Overwatch, recording the momentous occasion for posterity. Despite its place in the gaming pantheon, though, it met an unceremonious end, blinking out of existing with a simple "disconnected" message.


A few official lobby chat server messages did at least attempt to imbue the occasion with some import, telling players, "Even the best journeys end, but a new one is right around the corner. Thank you, heroes! See you October 4th!". A final message ahead of Overwatch 1's oblivion simply read, "See you on the other side".

Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games' much-loved 2008 original, once again putting players in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke as they journey through the Necromorph-infested mining ship USG Ishimura. This time, though, EA Motive is attempting to bolster the fear factor on modern systems with enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks including improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Since confirming a Dead Space remake was in the works last year, EA Motive has been unusually open about its development process, detailing the project's progress in a series of livestreams focusing on gameplay changes, audio, and art.

Acquisitions haven't just been limited to the likes of developers and publishers, however, with the host of various fan wiki pages - Fandom - acquiring Giant Bomb, GameSpot, MetaCritic, GameFAQs, Comic Vine, Cord Cutters News, and TV Guide.
Fandom is something that'll be familiar to most of us. There's a rather high chance then when you googled that character in that Rings of Power show everyone is talking about, you wound up on a Fandom webpage. It now appears that Fandom is stretching its wings and approaching pop culture media with open arms, literally.

The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like "Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries might be abandoning its custom Slipspace Engine for Unreal Engine.


This comes from journalist Jeremy Penter (thanks VGC), who wrote yesterday (October 2), "I can only confirm that many sources are saying this and very clear that it's already been decided and Halo is for sure switching to Unreal. I feel like it's time for other switches behind the scenes including people leaving and their past problems. Unreal is a great choice."


It's not uncommon for developers to switch engines if they find it isn't working particularly well, like when Kingdom Hearts 3 switched from Square Enix's quite at-the-time broken Luminous Engine to Unreal Engine 4. The awkward thing is that this engine was meant to power the future of the Halo series, which if the reports are true, clearly isn't something it will be doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retro Studios, the team behind Metroid Prime and Donkey Kong Country Returns, once pitched a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics.


This project was dubbed Heroes of Hyrule, and would not have had Link as the main character. Rather, the Hylian hero would have turned up as an NPC. 


Per YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming, which got its hands on Retro Studios' original pitch, Heroes of Hyrule would have told the story of a magical book.

So far, Bungie, IO Interactive and Ubisoft have issued statements to reassure Stadia users that they’re investigating ways to salvage their saves. It’s a welcome development following Google’s sudden shutdown revelation.

When Black launched in 2006 for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it promised to be Criterion's revolutionary take on the FPS genre - just as Burnout had won legions of fans for the studio's version of racing. 


The game recieved largely positive reviews, though early plans for a sequel never materialised. Some who worked on the game, including its namesake Stuart Black, later left to make Bodycount - a spiritual successor developed by Codemasters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember in Dead Space, if you messed up, you’d see your mentally deranged, long-suffering player avatar Isaac Clarke get impaled through the eye by a massive needle? Or fully decapitated by a horrible alien? Or sucked out into the vacuum of space without a helmet? It almost felt as if he were the plaything of a sadistic god; torturing him for the entertainment of an audience of PS3 and 360 players, safely tucked into a little nest on their sofas.

That level of sadism hasn’t gone away in Glen Schofield's – co-creator of Dead Space and its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol. In fact, it seems like he’s eager to get even more indiscriminately violent, this time. In an interview with Mark James, chief technical officer at Striking Distance and second-hand man to Schofield, I learned that The Callisto Protocol wants you to die. A lot. And it even rewards you for seeing all the gruesome ways your new interactive plaything, one Jacob Lee, can be offed.

“This is a hard game, you are going to die a lot,” says James. “But in dying, at least, we can give you a cool way to go.”

        <updated>2022-10-03T14:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Stadia finally met its demise last week. After an unsuccessful launch with general apathy from the audience, there's an argument that the platform was doomed right from the very beginning - despite Google itself investing a gigantic amount of cash into the hardware and various publishing deals. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Stadia shut down its own development studio, while the logical evolution of the platform - as a 'white label' cloud system that could be used by publishers - wasn't really compatible with the Linux/Vulkan foundation. Features failed to materialise (remember being able to access a game state by sharing a link?) while there were always doubts about the 10.7 teraflops of GPU power. If graphics performance was so high, how come Xbox One X at 6TF produced superior results? Was that GPU actually virtualised over two users? I'd love to know for sure.
The thing is, as many have stated, Stadia had much to commend it in terms of actually delivering a decent enough streaming experience - markedly better than xCloud in terms of quality. Regardless, the system did not attract much interest and it's time to face realities about the actual viability of cloud-based platforms in general. 
Let's start with the technological arguments first. Put simply, if the platform holder is not responsible for the quality of the experience from beginning to end, there will always be problems. I've tried Stadia and xCloud on a 30Mbps fibre connection - and they simply did not work. I upgraded to Starlink and that didn't work either. Only now, with the arrival of fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) and gigabit internet does it actually work for me. My experience won't be the case for everyone, but the point is, there's no way to 'debug' it and make it work. There are other technological limitations too in a bandwidth-constrained scenario - if I'm playing Stadia and someone else in the home decides to download a game or even just watch Netflix, there are going to be issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A game that was previously meant to have been an official Dune adaptation that was ultimately cancelled has been released under a fresh name 20 years later.


You might have heard about the upcoming open-world survival MMO based on the Dune series that's slated for PC and current-gen consoles, but quite frankly it's got nothing on the unreleased GBA game Elland: The Crystal Wars. Oh, you haven't heard of Ellan? Well, there's a small chance you might have heard its original name, Dune: Ornithopter Assault (thanks PCGamer).


Elland, as it is now known, was meant to come out in 2002 from Hungarian developed Soft Brigade, who was supposed to be working on it with Cryo Interactive. The problem? Cryo Interactive declared bankruptcy, meaning Ornithopter Assault was unfortunately cancelled, even though it was basically finished.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony sounds like it's gearing up for the eventual release of the PS VR 2, as it plans to make two million units by March next year.


This comes from Bloomberg, who says that people familiar with the situation provided them this information. Mass production apparently began last month (September), and as of yet there hasn't been any supply chain issues. It's also noted that the production figure might change depending on the headset's sales momentum when it's released early next year, whenever that might be.


According to the report, Sony's roadmap for the PS VR 2 is predicting a much greater popularity than the original PS VR for the PS4. The company apparently hopes that big name titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain that draws on pre-established IP will bring players in, even with the general rise in living costs.

Beyond Good & Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, and has been in development ever since. This 14-year-long period of development has managed to overtake the previous record holder, Duke Nukem Forever, which finally released in 2011 after having been announced in 1997.
The original game, Beyond Good & Evil, launched in 2003 as a third-person action game. Coming from Michel Ancel, the mind behind the Rayman series, the game follows reporter and martial artist Jade as she attempts to uncover a sinister, ongoing alien plot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When action RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn was revealed in March, its cinematic trailer struggled to conjure up anything more than a slight tinge of excitement. Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the "Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn't it?" category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year's Gamescom, and chat to A44's CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I'd expected, honestly, and I've come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From today you can sign up to Eurogamer's Supporter program and get your first month for £1, opening up ad-free browsing and access to the weekly Essentials newsletter that recently almost had Edge deputy editor and friend of the site Chris Schilling have an accident. You can't say fairer than that, surely. 


It's been a year since we launched the Supporter program, and it's seen the return of regular weekly podcasts, the Off-Topic series and Bertie's wonderful One-to-One series where he's profiled in-depth legends such as Ken and Roberta Williams and Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. 


For £1 (or $1, in a neat conversion thanks in part to our tanked economy) you'll get Standard supporter access, which will give you the site ad-free as well as the weekly Essentials newsletter plus 'Supporter' status on comments - so you can shout 'slow news day?' with added authority. After the trial period it's £3.99 per month for Standard Supporter status, with the Premium tier which opens up the bi-weekly Off-Topic pieces and early access to the Weekly and One-to-One podcasts coming in at £5.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears that three members of Disco Elysium developer ZA/UM have "involuntarily" left the company.
This comes from a recent Medium post from Martin Luiga, co-founder and secretary of the ZA/UM cultural association. As a note: the post has announced that the ZA/UM cultural association has been dissolved. This association was an art collective, and was not directly responsible for development of the game, as ZA/UM the company still exists. In the post, Luiga also revealed that ZA/UM Studio founder and Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov haven't been at the company "since the end of last year."
Rostov later confirmed the news on his personal Twitter account writing, "We confirm that we are no longer at the studio," on behalf of himself, Kurvitz, and Hindpere. Luiga noted in the post that the "their leaving the company was involuntary," though didn't elaborate much in the post about why this took place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been another busy year for No Man's Sky. Not only has the exploratory space sim received three significant updates in 2022 - delivering some of the most meaningful revisions it's yet seen its six years of post-launch support, developer Hello Games has been working behind-the-scenes on bringing the game to a number of new platforms in the not-too-distant future: Switch, PSVR2, iPad, and MacOS. Of those, Switch comes first, arriving on Nintendo's console - alongside a major 4.0 update for all players - this Friday, 7th October. Ahead of release, Eurogaemr sat down with Hello Games boss Sean Murray to discuss the 'madness' of porting to Switch, No Man's Sky's eagerly anticipated 4.0 update, the studio's future, and more.

ON THE STATE OF THINGS IN 2022
 
Somewhat incredibly, it's been over six years since No Man's Sky's infamously rocky launch, during which time the studio has released a staggering 20 free updates, massively changing the trajectory of the game, both in terms of its scope and reception. "In general," Murray tells me when I ask about the studio's outlook in 2022, "I think we're a really happy team. I think we're sort of the happiest and the most productive we've been in the last five or six years… The launch of No Man's Sky, if I was to plot that on a graph, it was maximum stress, and there's been a gradual but steady improvement year-on-year in how we do things and within the team. I think we're enjoying it, you know."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-profile mod maker Lance McDonald has released footage of what looks to be a working PlayStation 5 exploit that leaves the console "jailbroken". 


McDonald's video appears to show custom code being read by a PS5 through an exploit in its online User Guide. Once run, the console is able to access debug settings and then install the infamous PT demo - which is, of course, no longer available under normal circumstances.


So, how bad is this for Sony? Well, for now, the use of this exploit is limited. Reportedly this method is still "fairly unstable" and offers "read/write access, but no execute" - so you could download the PT demo, for example, but not yet play it.

This month I accepted 226 and rejected 33 packages. The overall number of packages that got accepted was 232.
All in all I addressed about 60 RM-bugs and either simply removed the package or added a moreinfo tag. In total I spent 5 hours for this task.
Anyway, I have to repeat my comment from last month: please have a look at the removal page and check whether the created dak command is really what you wanted. It would also help if you check the reverse dependencies and write a comment whether they are important or can be ignored or also file a new bug for them. Each removal must have one bug!

While Google confirmed it will refund all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store, users have been left concerned about their in-game data. 


Thankfully, developers are trying to ensure these players are not going to see their efforts wasted when Stadia ultimately closes its doors.

Originally revealed by MP1st, this remaster will allegedly bring Zero Dawn closer in terms of visuals to its successor, Forbidden West. 


While, at the time of writing, it is unclear whether this is a "from the ground up" remake of the 2017 title, it is claimed that this version of Zero Dawn will see new character models, improvements to the game's lighting system and animations, and "overhauled textures".

    Not a muscle moved on Rust's face.  There was a clink as
    Vimes's badge was set neatly on the table.



    "I don't have to take this," Vimes said calmly.



    "Oh, so you'd rather be a civilian, would you?"

The only issue is that some firmware files are still missing and I had to install them manually.
Updates are needed for the firmware-amd-graphics package (#1019847) for the Radeon 680M GPU (AMD Rembrandt) and for the firmware-atheros package (#1021157) for the Qualcomm NFA725A Wi-Fi card (which is actually reported as a NFA765).
s2idle (AKA "modern suspend") works too.
For improved energy efficiency it is recommended to switch from the acpi_cpufreq CPU frequency scaling driver to amd_pstate. Please note that so far it is not loaded automatically.
As expected, fwupdmgr can update the system BIOS and the firmware of the NVMe device.]]></summary>

For some reason, back at the Games Developer Conference in 2019, Google decided to put on a small exhibit that featured the E.T. game for Atari, the Sega Dreamcast, and the Nintendo Power Glove. The exhibit was meant to tease the Stadia, Google's cloud-based platform, but the through line of these three icons of gaming is that they were all notable failures. And now, you can own these very items, with your money going towards The Video Game History Foundation!


As reported by Kotaku, VGHF founder Frank Cifaldi recently posted about these three items, as they were loaned to Google by the organisation. "Remember when Google Stadia had that GDC display where they sat it next to three of gaming history's most famous failures?" wrote Cifaldi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to tell people to never mention Resident Evil 5 or 6 in my presence. There wasn’t any real reason, other than the fact that I’d previously felt these games were one big letdown for the whole Resident Evil series. This sentiment is shared by many, but over time – and as of today, 10 years since it was first released – I’ve come to appreciate Resident Evil 6. Even if I can’t get into it.
I was a child when I first picked up a copy of Resident Evil 6 from a market stall down an alley in Yorkshire. It definitely wasn’t legitimate, but a younger version of myself was fascinated by the cover art (little did I know what everyone else thought of it at the time) and all the Resident Evil gameplay I’d grown up watching, thanks to my parents. I was, by some margin, too young to play Resident Evil 6, but my dad let me get a copy anyway, and I instead was allowed to watch him play it. Seems like a win-win for him, if you ask me.
Later down the line, I tried it for myself on Xbox One after having played Resident Evil 7 and more recently on Nintendo Switch – only to drop the game within the first couple of hours. I did this on more than one non-consecutive occasion, bouncing off the game within a few hours each time. The control scheme felt more awkward than ever before, and if I wanted to complete constant QTEs I’d rather play something from The Dark Pictures Anthology. For the most part, playing Resident Evil 6 felt like a chore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra and scientific computing. It aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use, has a syntax deliberately close to Matlab, and is useful for algorithm development directly in C++, or quick conversion of research code into production environments. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 1023 packages other packages on CRAN, downloaded 26.4 million times (per the partial logs from the cloud mirrors of CRAN), and the CSDA paper (preprint / vignette) by Conrad and myself has been cited 497 times according to Google Scholar.
This release reflect as new upstream release 11.4.0 Conrad made recently. It turns out that it triggered warnings under g++-12 for about five packages in the fortify mode default for Debian builds. Conrad then kindly addressed this with a few fixes.
The full set of changes (since the last CRAN release 0.11.2.4.0) follows.
Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.11.4.0.1 (2022-10-01
Upgraded to Armadillo release 11.4.0 (Ship of Theseus)
faster handling of compound expressions by sum()


extended pow() with various forms of element-wise power operations


added find_nan() to find indices of NaN elements


Also applied fixes to avoid g++-12 warnings affecting just a handful of CRAN packages.



Courtesy of my CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.

While No More Heroes 3 was meant to be the last entry in the series, Suda51 hasn't necessarily ruled out another game somewhere down the road, though it sounds like it would be quite a long road if it ever did happen. The director recently spoke with GNN about the most recent game, asking if it's possible we'll see Travis Touchdown once more. 


"Yes, that’s right, Heroes No More 3 is Travis’ last battle,” Suda said (translations via VGC). "Nobody could say what’s going to happen 10 years from now, and I can’t say either. If there’s a big fan outcry, Travis might be back. Just like Tom Cruise came back as Maverick."

If I had a nickel for everytime Ed Sheeran has collaborated with Pokémon, I'd only have two nickels, but it's weird that it happened twice. Last time the ginger singer-songwriter appeared in the world of pocket monsters was in the mobile game Pokémon Go, where he held a special performance. This time it's for a new song called Celestial, which for the most part sounds like your average Ed Sheeran song.


The music video itself doesn't have too much of a story, and mostly just shows Sheeran going round parts of Richmond Hill, apparently, interspersed with animated bits of your favourite gen one Pokémon causing chaos, like setting his house on fire, or a Snorlax causing a taxi to literally go flying off into the sky.

After failing their San Andreas driving test, redditor MotorDesigner reached out to the GTA subreddit for advice on the best way to get around the city without a car - legally, in other words, even though the concept is comically novel in any GTA game, of course.

Admittedly, the in-game driving test doesn't look too troublesome - questions include when it's permissible to run a red light, what the correct driving position is, and how best to drive when "getting serviced orally by a girl while driving" - MotorDesigner failed to meet the San Andreas Department of Motor Vehicles' low, low standards, and therefore cannot drive legally in the city.

There comes a point when something leaks so much that you'd assume an official reveal would just take place, regardless of the timeline. Not the case for Returnal, as a brand new leak is here, shared via a YouTube video in an icon-era forum post (thanks, PCGamesN). The video has been taken down now, but not before people could clock some of the settings in the video.


Settings apparently included things like shadows, lighting, ray tracing, as well as a "screen optimisations" toggle, all of which sounds pretty par for the course settings for a PC game. It was also spotted that the game has a Nvidia DLSS graphics option, which will require a Nvidia GeForce graphics card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios has revealed what looks to be its first game, The Finals, an absolutely chaotic looking first-person shooter.


Revealed earlier this week, The Finals is a squad-based, free-to-play multiplayer shooter with inspiration from films like last year's breakout hit Squid Game, and dystopian classic The Running Man. The first trailer gives off an impressive first look, with what looks to be completely destructible environments, and enemies that burst into coins when you take them down. And you can already sign up to take part in the game's playtest, though the closed alpha is only running until tomorrow, October 3.


According to the studio's creative director Gustav Tilleby, The Finals is "a hero builder, not a hero shooter," going on to say the team wants "to build a game that provides players with the tools to meaningfully interact, change, and use their world. So, this is a shooter; it’s a game where aiming and shooting is important. But it’s also a game where the players can use the environment, and adapt to changes in the environment" (thanks, Polygon).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of pre-release video games suffer the fate of becoming the subject of memes. Assassin’s Creed has come under fire for melting NPC faces, and many a ‘visual downgrade’ has launched campaigns of know-it-all fans to drone on about despicable devs. But one of the funniest of all time is this week turning a decade old: Resident Evil 6’s logo.

The logo, of course, is quite innocuous in nature. Resident Evil is a game about viruses, and the logo is meant to resemble a virus under a microscope or whatever. I get it. I see it. But back in the run-up to Resident Evil’s release, people saw something else entirely.
They saw a giraffe, being fellated by a doubled-over figure. And now I’ve said it, even those of you who weren’t terminally online in 2012 probably see it too. The giraffe BJ logo cannot be unseen, like a debauched Rorschach test.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese megacorp Tencent is reportedly "resetting its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy" by focussing on "buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies".

According to Reuters, Tencent traditionally acquired minority stakes and was content with being a "passive financial investor", but it is now "aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets", chiefly in the "core gaming sector". Metaverse assets are also reportedly of interest to Tencent. 

Citing "four people with direct knowledge of the matter", Reuters adds that the shift in Tencent's M&A strategy "comes as the world's number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games" and follows regulatory issues in its home country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed a new co-op shooter currently titled Project U, and you can sign-up to playtest it now.


Details on this Project U are currently very vague, with the game's page saying that Ubisoft has "been exploring a new concept of session-based co-op shooter, where many players unite to prevail against an overwhelming threat!" You probably couldn't be less clear than that on pitching a game, considering that's an age old concept.


A piece of concept art has been shown off which you can see above, which is admittedly quite pretty, with the character designs having a toned-down Apex Legends vibe. The characters seem to be facing off against some kind of robot army, but aside from that we probably won't know more until Ubisoft shows off more (or someone leaks the closed test gameplay).

In a series of messages shared on Twitter, Dandy @ 6.2 –  who clarifies that they are "not a victim in this" but is "speaking out for a friend who IS a victim who otherwise felt like she had no voice" – posts a number of incriminating messages that intimate that despite reporting him, the alleged "sex pest" known as Charcoal Salamander had yet to be stripped of his "admin" role on the server. 

"So who else knew that the Phasmophobia devs are housing a sex pest in their official discord by keeping him admin and refusing to take any claims against him seriously because I sure do now," tweeted Dandy @ 6.2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legacy of Kain could see some kind of return, as a recent survey from Crystal Dynamics is asking fans about the series.


Earlier this year, Square Enix sold off a number of its IPs and a few of its studios to Embracer Group, which included the rights to Legacy of Kain, as well as Crystal Dynamics. Of course, that led some fans to hope that this could mean some kind of revival for the series, as what better time is there than now? Well, Kain fans might be in luck, as Crystal Dynamics has released a survey (which you can fill in here) asking some questions that certainly make it seem like it's interested in bringing the series back.


The survey asks a variety of questions about the series, obviously, and if like me you haven't played the games but have heard of them, it does ask why you haven't. It also more vaguely asks you about vampire games as a whole, and what kind of features in vampire games you enjoy.

First announced back in July, PlayStation Stars has now launched in Asia this week, with the confirmation that the loyalty program will come to North America and Europe in October. However, as reported by VGC, top members of the program are supposedly being given priority when it comes to customer support, which a number of players aren't happy with.


PlayStation Stars apparently has a four tier system that players can progress through by purchasing games and earning trophies. The fourth and highest tier requires you to buy four full-price games on the PlayStation and accrue 128 rare trophies. If a player manages to do this, they'll net a commemorative collectible, and according to Sony, "when contacting PlayStation Customer Support," tier four players "will be given priority in the chat order."

        <updated>2022-10-01T11:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a weird way, I feel ever so slightly sorry for the team of students who made Dorfromantik. Call it Joseph Heller Syndrome: first time out and they've made a classic. Does that leave them confused? Fearful? I suspect not, and this is why I only feel ever so slightly sorry for the team. The bad news is they've made something that will be hard to top, but the good news is that they have made something that will be hard to top. They have brought happiness to hundreds of thousands of us around the world. That kind of feeling sticks around, I think.


I play Dorfromantik an awful lot. It's a hex-based tile game about making landscapes. You get a stack of tiles with little rivers, train tracks, forests, villages, grass or farmland on, and you plonk them down. Quests appear to connect certain amounts of a certain type of landscape, and these quests, once fulfilled, give you more tiles. Eventually, though, you run out. Game over. Defeat? Not really, because you've been making a landscape all this time, worrying about the details, and once you're out, the landscape is finished. You get to see the whole thing as if for the first time. You made that!


Dorfromantik has just landed on Switch, which explains why I'm doing what I'm doing at the moment. I'm trying to unlock the Midwinter biome. Biomes are unlockable prizes that give the landscape a certain colour scheme or vibe. Midwinter does what you'd expect it to: it makes it look like winter. But more than that it transports me to Christmas, and to the bookshelves where the Christmasest book of all time lives, John Masefield's The Box of Delights. Christmas in the countryside! Dorfromantik is the most Masefield game of all time when you're playing with Midwinter. You hover above the landscape, above the woods and fields and little copses. I feel a bit like Santa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dome Keeper divides me. There's a part of me, each time I play, that's really happy to return, to feel the ground give under my drill, to hoist my mined resources triumphantly to my command centre and turn them into upgrades to improve my base. This time, I tell myself, I will build better and survive longer and make my dome's defences impenetrable. This run will be the one.
Then, inevitably, it isn't. Just as I get some real momentum going, a particularly savage wave of shadowy monsters overwhelms me, from both the air and ground, and my precious dome cracks and breaks and I am done for. Game over, try again. And the other part of me is peeved it failed. But I know this is how it goes, that these games are about trial and error and experimentation, and feeling your way to winning combinations of upgrades, so I grit my teeth and excavate the ground beneath my dome again.
But each time I repeat the cycle, some of the sheen fades, because the core activity in the game, digging, doesn't really change. Every time I face it anew, it feels more like the laborious work it is, and I know it will be a while before I unlock the upgrades that make light of it. And just as I do, just as I build up that sense of momentum again, the inevitable overwhelming wave of enemies comes and I am dead again, and my willingness to start over wanes.

specifically those created by master craftsman Tim
Pope. Off and on since then I've reviewed
the other plugins I use and tried a few others, so I thought I'd
write about them.


automatic colour name colouring
vim-css-color is a simple plugin that
recognised colour names specified in CSS-style: e.g. 'red', '#ff0000',
'#rgb(255,0,0)' etc., and colours them accordingly. True to its name,
once installed it's active when editing CSS files, but it's also supported
 for many other file types, and extending it further is not hard.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life's biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren't your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an odd full-circle moment for me that the least surprising bombshell news of all time – Stadia’s unceremonious cancellation – lands just a week out from EGX. The Eurogamer Expo (as it was still called back then) of 2011 was more or less the start of my career in games coverage, and it started when I managed to get an interview with OnLive’s Senior Vice President John Spinale, a smooth-talking American businessman of the kind I had up to that point only encountered via the medium of television. And always as a villain, even in shows produced by smooth-talking American businessmen.


Spinale, though, was extremely nice. He could tell I’d never interviewed anyone before, and knew how to set people at ease. Within seconds, it felt like a normal chat with someone you met down the pub. The sheer gulf of wealth disparity between us didn’t seem to matter. John was excited to tell me about OnLive, this strange new concept that was going to disrupt the gaming business, and I was excited to hear about it.


It was, and is, a brilliant concept, and the basic pitch for OnLive pretty much applies to the Stadia platform which died a decade later: imagine never having to buy new hardware. That was the first thing that appealed to me, a potless call centre worker at the time, who saw the looming new generation of consoles as less of an exciting new future and more of a £400 tax on joy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we're discussing the failure of Stadia, and why Google's cloud gaming gamble struggled from the start.


The announcement of Stadia's demise came as a shock to some - including many developers with titles only weeks from launch - yet still feels like it was on the cards for some time. After a rocky launch and the closure of Google's internal game development studios, what future did Stadia have left? Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson weighed in earlier today with his thoughts.

Could Stadia have been a success? What does this all mean for game preservation? And if Google failed, with all of its billions, what future does cloud gaming have elsewhere? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, and Liv Ngan share their thoughts.

Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It's not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google's own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

The YouTuber, who has uploaded their videos to the channel Re-Imagined Games, started work on the remake over two months ago.

In order to create the game, they've had to learn Unreal Engine 5 with zero experience in video game development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol gets constantly compared to Dead Space – and it makes sense, really. A lot of the developers are the same, a lot of the core ideas are the same, and it even looks quite similar, really. But this new venture from young developer Striking Distance is doing more with its horror than Dead Space could back in 2008; we’re 14 years down the line, now, and technology has come a long way. 

Striking Distance really cares a lot about horror. The staff have been ruthless in studying the psychology of fear, and have boiled down the tenets of human dread to how we respond to atmosphere, tension, brutality, helplessness, and humanity. Taking each of these five strands and tinkering with them individually, Striking Distance reckons it’s made one of the scariest games ever made – no matter what your own personal tolerance for horror is.
Why is the developer so confident? A lot of it comes down to its tech. Mark James, chief technical officer at the studio, tells me in an interview that new-gen games can do things that just weren’t possible, even a few years ago. Whilst “50% of horror is in audio,” James assures me that a large portion of The Callisto Protocol’s dread comes from its, frankly, sadistic AI.

According to a new report from 9to5google, the project received initial approval but as it was intended to be a strictly single-player experience (instead of the asynchronous multiplayer in Death Stranding), the Kojima collaboration was cancelled as Google believed there was no longer a market for solo games.



Despite reaching the early stages of development, the project was reportedly cancelled by Stadia's general manager Phil Harrison in mid 2020 following the first mockups.

Both combined form a significant number of players, and most of them don't have good things to say.
At the time of this writing, the game has nearly 1,500 reviews on Steam. The overall rating is currently sitting at Mostly Negative, which is not a good look.
Looking at the reviews themselves, there are two main issues that keep cropping up. The first has to do with the game's anti-cheat software, which errors out for some players when launching the game. Without the anti-cheat running in the background, you won't be able to play FIFA 23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s now official, and irrefutable: Lego is no longer just for children. This has always been the case, of course, but in recent years the company itself has started to embrace this fact. First there was ‘Creator Expert’, a line of larger, more complicated and expensive sets. Then came adult-driven packaging, signaled by sleek black boxes and a marketing campaign that gleefully declares ‘Adults Welcome’. Like a lot of the best kids’ toys, Lego is for kids first – but is perfectly good for adults, too.

The Lego Group’s latest foray into the world of sets aimed at those hurtling towards their middle age at alarming speed is set 10306, the Atari 2600. This is exactly what you think it is – an almost but not quite real-life scale model of one of the most significant consoles in gaming history, dating all the way back to 1982.
Truth be told, the 2600 is quite a bit before my time (my first console was a Mega Drive), but I’m nevertheless definitely squarely in this set’s target audience: a video game nerd who also loves and collects complex-scale Lego, with an appreciation for the artistry of the older video game consoles. I mean, the machine has a wood grain finish, for goodness sake. You just don’t get that any more.

In a recent blog post shared on EA’s website, those interested can delve into ‘Inside Dead Space #1: Remaking a Classic’, in which Motive explains what it believes is key to bringing back and remaking such an iconic title.
First things first, the most important thing for Motive is to stay true to the original title, and this is without a doubt, what many fans of the original Dead Space are looking for. Senior producer Philippe Ducharme says, “We look at the original game with the utmost respect.”

We’re playing an away match against the Under 9 Tigers, and I’m in goal, being the team’s only goalkeeper, and despite my repeated request for new kneepads being consistently denied. “Ain’t got the funds, lad” was the constant refrain from the manager, Keith, ever clad in his suede coat, gold chains, and cashmere polo neck: the standard uniform at the time of people who had large status in small towns.
Last minute penalties. Unprotected joints. A striker four years my senior, having been kept back several years in school on account of his behavioural issues. Why his academic progression was reflected by the local football league is and will remain a mystery, but you must accept it for the purposes of this narrative. The point is: he was three times my size, and his legs were pneumatic pistons that could boot my head clean off and barely notice.
Mercifully, he booted the ball, rather than my skull, which was saved from his kinetic anger only by virtue of not being the object on the ground in front of him. The ball soared toward the back of the net, and would have punched a hole through the stand and into the dry cleaners across the main road outside, were it not for my left knee. My unprotected left knee. Which, as it happens, did not impede the ball’s journey into the net.

Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of Hands is a fairly "does what it says on the tin" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill "a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some console reveals just hit different. I remember queuing around the sun-drenched, weed-stench streets around San Francisco's Moscone Centre to get into GDC 2019's big Stadia show, the crazy rumours that spin up in the line for events like these - maybe it was the effect of that heavy smoke in the air, but someone told me Google had paid Sega big money to get a new OutRun as an exclusive, and I was somehow convinced - soon punctured by the bizarre reality.
Outside the hall, in an ominous show of forbearance as well as an example of how ill-conceived some of Google's ideas were, was assembled some of video game's most famous failures, with four plinths displaying a Dreamcast, Nintendo's Powerglove and Atari's ET with the final display left empty with a simple 'Coming Soon' for the soon-to-be-announced Stadia. Amidst all the bluster that would follow, it was the one thing from that event that would ring true. 
It's easy to be cynical about Stadia, and there was plenty of scepticism going around at the time of its reveal. Google's track record with product launches is spotty at best, with a rich history of big ideas being introduced before being tossed aside out of apparent boredom. The level of investment with Stadia, though, was simply bonkers. Millions was paid out to secure big blockbusters like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Cyberpunk 2077, while exclusives were secured from such talented studios as Q-Games, Splash Damage and Tequila Works. It felt, for a short while, that Google was taking this all very seriously - and how exciting it was to have a genuine new player in the game.

Quality assurance tester Mackenzie Clifton has spoken publicly to Axios about their departure from Nintendo of America, and revealed both the question on unionisation they asked, as well as the "confidential information" they were accused of leaking. 


During a January company Q&A with Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser, Clifton says they submitted the following question: "What does NoA think about the unionisation trend in QA in the games industry as of late?"

Yesterday Google announced the end of Stadia, its cloud-based streaming service. Despite ambitions of creating exclusive games, in 2021 its internal studios were closed leaving third-party developers to provide the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Admittedly, my expectations for NieR: Automata on the Nintendo Switch were quite low. I love Nintendo’s handheld more than most, picking it up near enough every day, but I’m also quite accustomed to it’s limited performance capabilities (as anyone that picked up Dark Souls on the platform will tell you).
So, when I had the opportunity to play NieR:Automata on Switch this past week, I began the download with a quiver of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ to hand. Yet, while I’m only about eight hours into Yoko Taro’s unsettling masterpiece, I can’t wait to see it through to the end (or 26 ends, in this case).
Just yesterday, we saw the Anniversary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim come to Switch, and this is one of many huge titles that has been ported to the handheld since its release in 2017. There’s also Dark Souls, Wolfenstein, and The Witcher 3, to name but a few triple-A juggernauts on the hybrid home console/handheld device. If you’ve picked any of these games up, you’ll know that they certainly feel compromised on the Switch compared to other platforms.

There was a nice buzz about EGX London this past weekend, a whiff of positivity about it, at people being back together, relatively unimpeded by the pandemic and playing games together again. EGX felt much more like its old self. And many of us were there, walking the halls, hosting quizzes (thank you if you came to one), and playing games.
And what games there were: big ones, small ones, old ones, new ones. One of the most eye-catching instalments was a pool table with an enormously warped corner, curving up into the air, and which made playing it feel completely different to normal. Amazing what one simple change can do.

That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding is hard. Really damn hard. The journey to mastery is one counted in years - or even decades.


Landing a kickflip while moving along? Sure, today there are wildly more complex tricks out there, but it's still a tremendous achievement. It takes hours of investment and a deep resilience to failure to get there. But the moment you pop the board high, flick it with a foot just enough to spin once beneath you, and successfully commit to the landing, the reward is immense. It's not an achievement recompensed in any kind of currency like score. Rather, to succeed is more than enough of a payoff.


That is the mindset that has clearly founded the design of Session: Skate Sim. Certainly, it is not as hard as real skateboarding, but this is a game that is profoundly challenging, and one that makes you think like a skateboarder. The clue is in the name. Developer creā-ture Studios has strived to deliver a skateboarding simulator. In doing so, they've built something that does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of real skating; even if that approach sometimes comes at the expense of what makes for a consistently enjoyable video game. To deconstruct what that means, the conversation inevitably starts with an iconic series.

If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, 
here's our archive.
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a game as pretty as Horizon Forbidden West. The environments feel unreal in their beauty, while the details and textures on character models and clothing are incredible. All this stunning work does mean any imperfections are very distracting though - can someone please explain why Aloy’s hair is seemingly made of wool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. "He’s the person behind the worst of the twists," creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. "He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Were you fortunate enough to make it down to EGX London this year? It was this past weekend, and, if you ask me, there was a nice vibe around the place. It was nice to be back playing games together relatively unimpeded by the pandemic, and the show is feeling much more like its old self again. But what caught our eye there?


That's what I'm talking to my two Weekly guests Martin Robinson and Liv Ngan about today. What did Liv think of Wo Long, did Martin like Street Fighter 6, and why was everyone talking about new card game Wildfrost?


Elsewhere in today's show, I catch us up on some of the reviews we've missed while we've been away - sorry for the gap in our programming, but I've had some time off - before getting onto what will probably be the hot topic of the week: the FIFA 23 review. It's the final FIFA-branded game, and there's a lot to both like, and loathe, about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over six months after its big reveal, World of Warcraft's Dragonflight expansion has been given a release date, with its launch now officially scheduled for 28th November this year.


As detailed back in April, Dragonflight's first major addition is a new location known as the Dragon Isles, the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind. This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn'ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player's chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.

Foxhole is one of the few to do it successfully: a single, massive World War 2 battlefield in which players don't just fight at the frontlines, but form supply routes, build defenses, and otherwise take the reigns of the logistics of war. After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well this is a mouthful.
I recently worked on a neat hack called puppet-package-check. It
is designed to warn about manually installed packages, to make sure
"everything is in Puppet". But it turns out it can (probably?)
dramatically increase the bootstrap time of Puppet bootstrap when it
needs to install a large number of packages.
Detecting manual packages
On a cleanly filed workstation, it looks like this:
root@emma:/home/anarcat/bin# ./puppet-package-check -v
listing puppet packages...
listing apt packages...
loading apt cache...
0 unmanaged packages found

A messy workstation will look like this:

This newly discovered Pokemon lives in the Paldea region and is known as a Garden Eel Pokemon. It may look like Diglett, but it’s a different species. It is a Water-type and features the abilities Gooey and Rattled.
Boasting an exceptional sense of smell, Wiglett can pick up scents from over 60 feet away. It has a skittish disposition and is constantly cautious of its surroundings. When it notices the scent of other Pokemon, it burrows into the sand to conceal itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is shutting down Stadia, with the beleaguered cloud gaming service set to remain live for players until 18th January 2023.


Stadia's misfortunes are, of course, well-documented; despite initial praise for the service's streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia's failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.


And while Google continued to insist Stadia was "alive and well" as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had "deprioritised" the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services' underlying technology to third-parties.

        <updated>2022-09-29T16:31:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released earlier in the year, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection brought the PlayStation 4-era franchise entries to the new PS5, with some mild enhancements to the overall presentation and a major focus on resolutions and performance. 4K at 30fps, 1440p at 60fps and 1080p at 120fps effectively allowed you to balance pixel count and frame-rate whichever way you wanted. These choices are now even wider thanks to a recent 120Hz VRR patch, which delivers some great results.


While the Naughty Dog titles deploy state of the art rendering, thus far the studio has not embraced dynamic resolution rendering to balance performance - not even in its latest title, The Last of Us Part One. So, in theory at least, the PS5's GPU is not fully maxed out. To be clear, the new patch 1.002 does not add this feature, but via VRR upgrades it taps into that latent GPU power by offering the ability to unlock frame-rate, while also adding a 40fps fidelity mode. This works in a similar manner to the option seen in Ratchet and Clank, the Spider-Man titles and Horizon Forbidden west. 


The new 40fps option replaces the 30fps fidelity mode when you boot the game with 120Hz output enabled on your PS5. In addition to that is an unlocked version of the same mode, leveraging VRR to deliver a smooth experience with a variable frame-rate. Visually speaking, this is a match for the old fidelity mode - both render at a crisp native 4K resolution, with the same capable treatment of fine detail. Even in the most intense scenes, a straight 3840x2160 pixel count seems to be in play - there's still no DRS, meaning that effectively, we're 'hoping' there's at least 10fps of clearance once the frame-rate cap is increased.

Is this what 31 years as a sexless mascot does to a mf?

"From the moment you start the game to the moment you end the game, there are no camera cuts or load screens—unless you die," says senior producer Philippe Ducharme.


"The Ishimura is now fully interconnected, so you can walk from Point A to Point Z, visit the entire ship, and revisit locations you’ve already completed to pick up things you might have missed—that’s all new. It’s now a completely unbroken experience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern Warfare 2 recently wrapped up what ended up being the biggest beta in Call of Duty history, so you can imagine that popularity also came with a lot of feedback from players. Though sentiments are generally positive, a few issues in particular have cropped up repeatedly.
In an effort to address these concerns, developer Infinity Ward highlighted some of the most common ones and discussed what it's going to be doing about them for launch.
In a blog post, the studio commented on certain issues, leaving others undiscussed. Sadly, even the ones that got mentioned by name didn't receive satisfying answers.

The little bar in the top-right of the screen strobes to tell me I've completed an objective. Nice! Objectives in Ultimate Team range from simple things like scoring a certain number of goals, to more complex tasks like doing so with assists from specific players or winning dozens of times. They give you rewards, usually in the form of XP that advances FIFA's version of a battle pass, where you unlock more rewards by progressing through the levels. So, completing an objective is expected after a couple games, and generally it's neat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has technically been released yet again, with the Anniversary Edition being made available on the Nintendo Switch eShop, seemingly out of nowhere. 
I’ve played Skyrim an embarrassing amount of times. Despite how many peers and friends insist Morrowind and Oblivion are the better games, it’s Skyrim that continually has me crawling back. No matter how many game-breaking bugs I encounter, or how many times I simply forget to save at a pivotal moment and end up frustrated, I have a never-ending toxic relationship with Tamriel. I’m okay with this.
My last full play through of the title was on the Nintendo Switch (excluding the time I spent hours modding Skyrim in VR to realise that actually, I should probably play Blade & Sorcery instead). I didn’t expect much from Skyrim on the Switch, and honestly thought that I’d probably give up and play it on Xbox again. However, I was wrong. I played the game to completion, and only had to lose my progress twice when bugs occurred; this was a success, if you ask me.

The anime adaptation of the cult classic Sega game was first announced back in September 2020, before being broadcasted and available to stream on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll respectively.  


A second season was reportedly in the works before the cancellation, which is likely a part of the wider purge by Warner Discovery of its properties following the merger of the two media conglomerates in April this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our preview of Crisis Core's impending remaster, Alex and I sat down to chat about its place in the new post-remake Final Fantasy 7 universe, and whether it still holds up as a prequel in that context, over some gorgeous 4K gameplay footage.
There’s no doubt that the burgeoning media franchise that is Final Fantasy 7 has picked up a lot of new fans since the remake launched in 2020, introducing an entire generation of fresh players to a universe that has been steadily expanding since 1997 with multiple prequels and film projects making up the “Compilation of Final Fantasy VII” metaseries.
Crisis Core originally released in 2007, ten years after the original game, and is widely considered to be the best of FF7’s spin-offs, chronicling the life of a key fan-favourite character and re-examining a pivotal moment in the timeline that casts a deep shadow over the rest of the series.

Previously, we had Lunar New Year celebrations on Steam which are now being replaced with a spring sale. Without further ado, here are the dates you can expect your wishlist, and plenty other games, to be much cheaper.
The autumn sale will start on Steam on November 22, running for a week until November 29. As for the winter sale, which is perhaps my favourite for dishing out seasonal gifts to long-distance friends, will run from December 22 to January 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! With Dorfromantik landing on Switch today, here's a piece from Jay that takes a closer look at landscapes. If you're interested in the Switch port itself, we're running a piece on Saturday.


I can’t ever get my Dorfromantik dioramas to look quite right. Other people seem to be able to make their rural idylls look balanced, organised. Villages and farms are rounded while rivers gently meander. For me, it’s the other way around. Rivers stagnate in huge lakes while houses and fields snake across the landscape in jagged lines.


It chafes particularly because we’re all familiar with the kind of bucolic landscape that Dorfromantik tasks you with making. By placing hexagonal puzzle pieces so that the edges line up –  tree to tree, field to field, home to home – you build out these landscapes, and score points for keeping the jigsaw aligned. Every so often a tile will come with a quest, like turning it into a farm with 50 fields, and completing these gives you more tiles. You can play until you run out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s midnight, and the light of a full moon glints on the surface of the Pacific Ocean. You can see the ebbing of the shoreline, how the light scatters differently on the surface of the waves versus the sand. Alongside the wash of the sea, you can hear subdued, guttural groaning, the shuffling of Crocs through sand. There’s an undead woman – flesh hanging off her cheek in a clump – limping towards you. No urgency, no pressure. She could be drunk, in another time and place, and just off for a walk down Venice beach.
But this isn’t LA. It’s HELL-A, per an enthusiastic Dambuster rep, who is basically our tour guide for this unlikely excursion to a doomed west coast vacation. She told me to soak in the ambiance – the sights, the sounds, and *deep breath* yes, even the sweet rotting smells – of this doomed Los Angeles as we sat down to get about an hour’s worth of time with Dead Island 2. And her guidance was appreciated, because what a stunning game it is. 
“We really want this to be a sort of personal journey, right?” says art director Adam Olson as I recount studying this undead woman – watching the way the skin moved independently of her flesh, watching how she twitched, and shuffled, and wobbled as she struggled against the sand. “We want you to get really up close and visceral in our game. So many games, developers just fill them out. We didn’t want to do just that – we wanted to really populate our spaces; there’s things to see everywhere, there are details in everything. It should feel like a rich world. I think when people get their hands on our game, they’ll see that everything has these fun little details and interesting things to see. It’s been meticulously hand-crafted.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone's final major update has landed - two-and-a-half years after the phenomenally-popular battle royale launched and changed the series forever.


Warzone, which launched as a standalone free-to-play battle royale in March 2020 following the successful launch of 2019's Modern Warfare soft reboot, was an overnight phenomenon fuelled by lockdowns that made billions of dollars for Activision.


It's seen three major maps: Verdansk, Rebirth and Caldera, sometimes awkward integration with Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard, and crossovers with some of the biggest names in popular culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, we got our first look at Wild Hearts today as part of a live reveal for its debut trailer. Wild Hearts is the Monster Hunter-style action RPG from EA and Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force.
EA is positioning it as "the first AAA hunting experience for a new generation," which is true because it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on February 17, 2023 - skipping last-gen entirely.
Today's reveal trailer, which you can watch above, shows more gameplay than you might have expected. A deeper look at Wild Hearts' gameplay, however, will arrive next week: October 5. The game takes place in a fantasy version of feudal Japan called Azuma, where hunters take on monsters called Kemono.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deathverse: Let it Die is a brand of bizarre that has been sorely lacking from the battle royale genre, let’s start with that. It’s clunky, ultra-violent, flashy, and unconventional. It’s a game that many will find – and likely have found already – visually unappealing. But for me it’s a delicacy to gorge on — oozing a distinct character. I, in spite of its obvious flaws, like Deathverse: Let it Die. I like it a lot.
Coming hot from the minds over at Supertrick Games, Deathverse: Let it Die is a third-person action battle royale where a gaggle of bloodthirsty players battle it out on a pentagonal archipelago of post-apocalyptic islands. Over time, these sections are cut off the playing field, forcing everyone left alive to jump onto a singular arena where they must bust out the moves to claim the top prize. It’s classic battle royale goodness, packaged within a hopeless future television death game where competitors clash for swagger and glory rather than just survival.
The aspect of Deathverse: Let it Die that smacks you immediately is a toxic cocktail of world, tone, and humour that mix into a devilish drink: a Bloody Mary with actual blood. You’re greeted by two gold-plated presenters of the Death Jamboree, who instil in your the importance of fighting with style and taking out other players with as much pizzaz as possible. This reflects in the core gameplay of Deathverse — as taking out enemies with flamboyancy and dashing from fight-to-fight rather, than surviving conservatively, is what enhances your combat potential.

Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

After having spent some time with the game, I found myself to be pleasantly surprised by just how relaxing it all is.
I’ve never had a strong affection for Disney, but there’s something rather satisfying and wholesome about Disney Dreamlight Valley that sees me continually picking it up. That said, the Disney Dreamlight Valley Twitter has recently shared a string of tweets about its next update, and it appears that big things are coming.
First things first, the next update for Disney Dreamlight Valley will introduce one character I do remember not being too fond of as a child, and that’s Scar from The Lion King. He’ll arrive as part of the first content update, alongside plenty of bug fixes.

In hindsight, it's a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we're now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director's cut special editions. We've included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month's Time Capsule, but there's another notable exception we've decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016's Special Edition?

An advert for one game, Refantasia: Charm and Conquer, is described as having featured an "anime-style image of a young woman in a cage" in shackles and with torn clothing, which was singled out for particular criticism. 


Captions referenced "my master" and were accompanied by text which described the person as a "little girl". The ASA judged the character as being someone under 18 represented in a sexual manner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seems it’s that time of year again: the annual Intel CPU refresh is upon us, with CEO Pat Gelsinger announcing the 13th Gen "Raptor Lake" processor family onstage at Intel Innovation 2022 last night. These chips will stick to the hybrid Performance core/Efficiency core design introduced by the 12th Gen Alder Lake range – probably wisely, given that includes some of the best gaming CPUs ever – but ups the E-core counts, L2 cache capacities and clock speeds. Raptor Lake will go on sale on October 20th, a few weeks after the just-launched AMD Ryzen 7000 series.
The showcase also included a few key details on the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition, the top-ranking graphics card in the long-delayed Arc Alchemist lineup of gaming GPUs. This will also launch next month, on October 12th, and cost $329. Honestly, part of me was wondering if we’ll ever see the day, but yes: there really will be an Intel graphics card on the market. Even if it is more of an RTX 3060 rival than a cheap RTX 4080 alternative.

That story will now explain how players got to be so Honey I Shrunk The Kids small, Obsidian says, and potentially also allow you to "go big and go home" once all is said and done. 


Before that, though, there's plenty of new things to experience in version 1.0. A new area of the garden, the Eastern Upper Yard, has been opened up to players. It features a new tunnel system, more towering manmade items and fresh "angry bugs".

Behaviour Interactive’s party title takes the traditional melee-brawler formula and transforms it, making you and your pals use physics and control gravity in the bid to secure a win. The game also takes place on a spaceship known as the Arkade, which the gang has turned into their own set of arenas for gravity-based brawling.
You must attempt to cover all angles, literally, as brawling takes place on the floor, ceiling, and just about anywhere your Blazarpack can take you. In an additional bid to make Flippin Misfits as chaotic as possible, there are 35 different power-ups to play around with.

The stats cover all platforms combined where the beta was available, meaning PC as well as two generations of PlayStation, and Xbox.
Activision did not say how many players the beta attracted, or really offer any specific figures for those records. It's easy to see, however, that the beta was very popular. On Steam, for example, the beta immediately shot up to Steam's most-played list even before it became fully open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know the worst thing about Wolverine in cinema? He isn’t allowed to be horrible. Like, really horrible. The spit-and-polish Jackman got in his various silver screen adaptations wipe all the gore and viscera off those lovely adamantium claws, leaving us with a refined, glistening of everyone’s favorite Canadian mutant. There’s no abhorrent violence, no running people through, no wanton beheading – just to make a point (except in Logan, which is why it’s the best film). For the most part, the Wolverine we get in Hollywood is usually very different to the one we get in the comics.

Luckily, we have video games. For all its flaws, 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine didn’t care about the squeaky-clean image the films were trying to manicure. It let Wolverine off his leash, uncollared him, and let him run rampant through the scattered forces of Col. Stryker’s disbanded Team X.

Taking inspiration (apparently) from the likes of Devil May Cry and God of War, the game is effectively a series of rooms with people in that you could butcher. That’s it. Yes, it was repetitive, and yes, it was braindead – but hey; that’s what pulpy games are for, right? At least it was leagues ahead of, say, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z. There’s an element of ‘guilty pleasure’ to it – booting up the game to rinse/repeat the same fight in a slightly different room, again. But hearing Hugh Jackman’s specifically-recorded voice lines, listening to that satisfying snikt as combat ramps up and your claws come flying out, and lunging at an enemy before rending them limb-from-limb? No other game has come close to capturing that Wolverine dream quite so perfectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2's open beta has ended. It was a trial I entered with an open mind. Though I found the visibility and repetitive inputs of Modern Warfare 2019 difficult, I put a lot of hours into it. Subsequent entries felt worse due to a regression in graphical fidelity, but I still crave what Call of Duty offers.


Not fast-paced gunplay, but a game without commitment. Rather than knowing I have to devote hundreds of hours to the experience, I can fit in sessions across a range of timeframes thanks to multiplayer matches lasting around 15 minutes and frequent checkpoints in the campaign.


It's disappointing then that in three years between Modern Warfare entries, accessibility doesn't appear to have progressed. Admittedly, what we've seen during the last two weekends has been restricted to multiplayer, but the settings available informs what we're likely to see in the full release.

Both of these games marked the beginning of The Dark Pictures Anthology, a series of terrifying tales as told by the Curator, where you — the player — are placed in control of who lives and who dies.
As of today, all owners of either title will be able to install a free update. The update is set to improve various aspects of each game, and will hopefully provide a more immersive experience for players. More specifically, the update will include:

My favourite moment in The Excavation of Hob's Barrow came about three hours after I'd finished it. But we'll get to that in a bit.


From the off, it's hard not to root for Thomasina Bateman. In an age of steam trains and parasols, she has come to a small village in the north of England to dig up an ancient burial site, regardless of all the obstacles the local patriarchy - and the soggy English weather - can place in her way.

        <updated>2022-09-28T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple.

The Altar Of Hope update is already live in the game’s experimental branch and is coming to the main game when devs Red Hook are satisfied with its stability. You can catch a glimpse of the bounty hunter in the teaser below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you like it or not, weapon durability is here to stay in games. Whether you’re in the camp that thinks it helped make Breath of the Wild one of the standout games of a generation or not, you need to admit that the controversial system is a permanent fixture. Turn to pretty much any genre of game and you’ll find it there – Yakuza, Dead Rising, Fire Emblem, Far Cry, State of Decay, Minecraft, Zelda, Silent Hill. Weapon degradation is here to stay.

But it’s not a bad thing, is it? Sure, it can seem unrealistic – why would a katana cease to function as a sword after five or six goes? It’s not made of glass (in theory). Using a weapon that functions perfectly well, at full strength, until it breaks so catastrophically you cannot wield it at all is a little unrealistic, in my eyes; would it not dull, or jam, or lose some function first?
But, as a mechanic, I like it. Breaking weapons forces you, as a player, to adapt to the world you’re in. Far Cry 2 would have been far more boring if you could just waltz about with a gun that never jammed, right? Breath of the Wild would have lost a lot of its charm if you could just keep hold of that one early-game sword you loved so much.

At the time of publication, Ultimate Team was unplayable on both PlayStation and Xbox.


FIFA 23 doesn't launch proper until this Friday, 30th September, and its early access wasn't meant to begin until 4pm this afternoon, but the 10-hour EA Play trial was made available a day early, meaning FIFA 23's effective launch was yesterday, 26th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret we're big fans of PowerWash Simulator here at Eurogamer which, for me, makes this hour-long development deep dive video something of a must-watch. 


I've often wondered while playing whether certain objects auto-complete faster than others. If you're yet to try PowerWash yourself, it's worth knowing the game will, after you clean a certain amount of surface area, auto-complete the rest of the object in question. (This also provides a nice 'ding' sound.)


This subject is one of many covered in the developer video, which is ostensibly about how levels in the game are created but also delves into thoughts on dirt design, parkour, and the game's lack of fall damage.

But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

He only wanted to play Sonic Frontiers cos he’s daft, look out for an upcoming video preview of that along with some hands-on impressions of other stuff we looked at like Goat Simulator 3, which you’ve heard of, and Shadows of Doubt, which you haven’t.
We accosted Zoe and Ian from Eurogamer to ask them what they were playing at, and Mike Channell from Outside Xbox gave us a tantalising glimpse into the decadent lifestyle afforded him by all that YouTube cash. It was like an episode of MTV Cribs except we were stood on the balcony of an East London conference centre and the only luxuries on offer were a load of Diet Coke cans in a mini-fridge, and he didn’t let us have one.
We spoke to one of the developers of House Flipper 2 and confirmed that you don’t need to play the first one to understand what’s going on. We also confirmed shortly afterwards that security wanted us to leave the House Flipper 2 booth. But Connor flashed them his Gold Wristband and while they were reeling from the revelation that we were in gainful employment with the organisers of the event, we scarpered.

The four-part series is set 1,200 years before the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, and was created by Declan De Barra and The Witcher showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich.
Blood Origin will cover the Conjunction of the Spheres, a cataclysm trapping unnatural creatures such as ghouls and vampires in the dimension where the story takes place. The collision created rifts of different realms bringing with it a force known as chaos or magic. This event also displaced many native races,  unable to fight off so many dangerous creatures. The show will explain how the cataclysm happened, the reasons behind it, and how the first Witcher came to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still remember the first time I played Fortnite. Back then, I was well deep into the PUBG hole, and eager to get my hands on any new battle royale game. Epic Games, too, realised the genre’s potential early, and swiftly pivoted its seldom-discussed crafting and zombie defence game into a battle royale shooter. 
The company moved so quickly, in fact, it caught the ire of PUBG’s developer, who took it to court for blatantly ripping off its ideas. It wasn’t an accident, either; Epic Games directly cited PUBG as the core inspiration behind its then-nascent experiment.  
Game concepts aren’t proprietary, of course, so that lawsuit was never going to go anywhere. Setting aside the argument at the core of the dispute, Fortnite Battle Royale just wasn’t all that interesting back then. It stank of desperation, and the first version Epic put out felt cobbled together (probably because it was made in two months) to ride the crest of PUBG’s unbelievable wave. Its only claim to fame was bringing the instant building mechanic from the co-op defence mode into BR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

        <link href="https://www.vg247.com/the-diofield-chronicle-review"/>
        <updated>2022-09-27T14:02:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The DioField Chronicle has been released, and it’s seemingly pretty much already forgotten. This latest Square Enix strategy RPG is thoughtful, interesting, and flawed – though also pleasantly brisk. It deserves better than it’s getting.

What it’s getting, by the way, feels like the pretty classic small game from Square Enix treatment. It got a surprisingly big-time announcement, making its debut in one of Sony’s high-profile State of Play broadcasts. After that, though, it appeared relegated to second-tier status. It was promoted little, and even review code arrived at the eleventh hour; dropped into the inboxes of media around the world just a few days before Square Enix said reviews could go live - which itself was just a short time before release. That’s why you didn’t see many pre-release reviews, if you’re wondering.

It’s a shame to see a game like this get treatment like that, because it’s interesting. At heart, The DioField Chronicle is a strategy RPG in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics, but it’s ultimately a little faster and looser, and features several elements that inject a little of the real time tactics genre into the mix. The result is something quite thrilling and unique – which is important, since we’re currently in something of a resurgent golden age of strategy RPGs, with Fire Emblem the biggest it’s ever been and even Square Enix giving Tactics Ogre another run-out with an upcoming remaster.

In both of those western-themed platformers, you were hunting for gem-like treasures to take back to the surface so you could get bigger and better equipment to begin the dig cycle anew. Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. 
Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

Discussing his company's troubles with harassment and workplace toxicity, as highlighted by a number of employees since the summer of 2020, Guillemot told La Presse that Ubisoft had been "progressing at a good pace" in dealing with its issues - but that "creating a video game is not easy" and sometimes created "a lot of tension". 


"Techniques must be put in place to ensure that everyone succeeds in finding their place," Guillemot continued, now discussing the games industry in general. "To create, you need a little friction, because everyone has to succeed in getting their idea across. It's a job that brings a lot of rewards when you succeed, but it's difficult."

This trailer didn't have any real dialogue between the characters (there were plenty of tense looks and some furtive Shh-ing), but it still offered an evocative picture of the world that HBO has created for its TV audience. You can see this trailer for yourself below. 


Right off the bat, it is clear HBO has taken this adaptation seriously, with several scenes looking like they have been pulled straight from Naughty Dog's video game series. There is a lot to unpack in the minute and half or so of footage, so let's dive on in.

The trailer, which is just under two minutes in length, shows Joel and Ellie in the midst of the action, as well as some of their counterparts. Additionally, we also get a much closer look, albeit briefly, at what live-action Clickers will look like in the adaptation. 
We obviously know now that Pedro Pascal is stepping into Joel’s shoes, with Bella Ramsey performing as Ellie, but we’ve seen other information trickle in slowly over the past few months. Not only have we already seen a few clips from the show, but we also saw Lamar Johnson and Kevin Woodard revealed as the actors behind Henry and Sam.

The Altar of Hope update adds a new type of reward - Candles of Hope - which you can earn and then spend on various attributes which should make future missions safer for your party.


As you'd expect, the bigger the danger, the bigger reward in terms of Candles bagged at the end. Missions will offer more Candles the further you manage to progress, but suffer a wipe and you'll see your Candle hoard penalised.

Speaking to IGN, Kato admitted he likes the style but the 2D pixel art of the original has been retained instead.


"No, we didn't think about making it HD-2D," he said. "We kind of played with the idea of making it 3D, but what we were really thinking about was, 'What are the major parts about this game that are really appealing to everybody?' And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn't have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it."

The developer has now revealed that it's parting ways with Take-Two, leaving it with a few options as to how to proceed.
According to People Can Fly's announcement, Take-Two shared its intent to terminate the relationship in a letter to the studio. The GTA publisher has been funding the project since it began, with People Can Fly's New York team spearheading development.

Along with this news, we also have a breakdown of his moveset. 


This will include fart bombs (of course) and a move called "Meeseeks and Destroys" which summons a meeseek that will then attack by running forward and deploying an uppercut or by wielding a golfclub. Lastly, Rick will be able to aim and place two portals thanks to his "Basrick Portal Theory" move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you got your favourite MultiVersus character to level 15 or above yet? You're going to wish you had sooner, if not, because as of MultiVersus patch 1.03, it's going to take you twice as long to master new characters.
The new patch – which comes along to buff or nerf 15 of the characters in the game – also introduces some changes to how progression works in the title. Per the patch notes themselves, developer Player First Games notes: "The XP required to go from level 3 – 15 on the character mastery track has been doubled."

That may seem extreme, but apparently it's because the developer was seeing people master their characters too quickly. "We were finding that players could get to level 15 of the mastery track too quickly," PFG explains in the patch note update. "This [change] is to help us make it a bit more of a journey."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two Interactive, publisher of GTA and Borderlands, has pulled out of a development and publishing agreement with People Can Fly, the company behind Outriders and Gears of War Judgment.


A financial update from People Can Fly states that Take-Two is ditching the project after two years of work - but that development will still continue. 


Codenamed Project Dagger, the game is said to be a new action adventure IP, which People Can Fly now retains the rights to. It sounds like Take-Two had the option to purchase these rights - which it has not exercised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Grounded released into early access a little over two years ago, it immediately became a personal favourite. The story wasn't complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This summer, I signed up to participate in the Northcape 4000
<https://www.northcape4000.com/>, an annual 4000km bike ride between Rovereto
(in northern Italy) and the northernmost point of Europe, the North cape.
The Northcape event has been held for several years, and while it always ends
on the North Cape, the route there varies. Last years’ route went through the
Baltics, but this years’ was perhaps as direct as possible - taking us through
Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech republic, Germany again, Sweden,
Finland and finally Norway.
The ride is unsupported, meaning you have to find your own food and
accomodation and can only avail yourself of resupply and sleeping options on
the route that are available to everybody else as well. The event is not meant
to be a race (unlike the Transcontinental, which starts at the same day),
so there is a minimum time to finish it in (10 days) and a maximum (21 days).
Unfortunately, this meant skipping some other events I’d wanted attend
(DebConf, MCH).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great many new Cyberpunk 2077 mods are adding bits and pieces from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new ultraviolent spin-off anime series. Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is The Last of Us day, an annual occasion formerly known as Outbreak Day that marks the in-universe date in which the Cordyceps infection spread throughout humanity. 


This year, to celebrate the occasion, Naughty Dog and HBO have released a new trailer for their upcoming TV adaptation, which stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This new trailer gives us all a closer look at Ellie and Joel in action as they make their way across America. Along with seeing more of the two protagonists, we now also have a better, but still brief look at the series' infected Clickers - complete with their unmistakable and haunting noises. Other characters such as Ellie's friend Riley also make a showing. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

DICE has taken the decision "to competely remove certain sections of the map" which it has decided broke the game's "flow" or were simply "too far away". 


Getting around the game will be quicker too - as Battlefield adds the Polaris RZR buggy as an in-world vehicle. To my eyes, it looks like a cross between a tank and a golf cart. Why not?

In the last month we've had two big Marvel video game announcements, one being Uncharted director Amy Hennig's next title involving Captain America and an earlier incarnation of Black Panther in the second world war. And the more recent announcement being the Iron Man game coming from the EA owned Motive Studio. But don't place any bets on these characters meeting each other à la the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because Marvel has no plans for it.


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, Marvel executive Bill Rosemann made it clear that on the games front, everything would be a separate entity (thanks, Eurogamer). "The world is, amazingly, very familiar and accepting of the multiverse," Rosemann said. "We have all these different realities. Now they're all real, and we want to give everyone the freedom to tell their story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RuneScape, the popular MMORPG created by the lovely UK folk over at Jagex, has received its Fresh Start Worlds today, allowing players to jump in and start from scratch with a reset economy and all the unique quirks that aspect provides. Old School RuneScape players won’t have to wait too long either, as Fresh Start Worlds for that title are also due soon on October 19.
The reasons for grinding up a new character again? These Fresh Start Worlds come with unique cosmetic rewards including capes, halos, and other swanky gear. Set to last for a limited time, characters and loot obtained on these Fresh Start Worlds will later be transferred over to a core world with all their stuff. Great news for those who put in the time, but also the cause of some concern. We’ll touch on that later.
To access these Fresh Start Worlds, players will need to create a brand new account and purchase a fresh membership according to the official support website. This isn’t a burden to new players, who’ll be able to use these fresh servers as an opportunity to get in on the same level as others, but for existing RuneScape fans it’ll mean cashing out for a second subscription alongside their pre-existing account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Koei Tecmo's upcoming take on Monster Hunter is officially called Wild Hearts, and its first trailer is coming this week.

Last month, EA announced that it would be collaborating with Omega Force, the Koei Tecmo studio behind the Warriors series, through its EA Originals program to make a game it called "the next great hunting game," obviously implying it'll be something like Monster Hunter. That game now has a name - Wild Hearts - and this Wednesday, September 28, 3pm BST, we'll get a first look at it in its reveal trailer.


"Prepare for an epic adventure set in a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan," reads the trailer's simple description, so you'll have to wait until it's live before you find out any more. There is some kind of scary-looking dog included in the teaser post, presumably one of the beasts that you'll be hunting whenever the game does launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just finished Deathloop on Xbox Game Pass. You may have already seen that I quite liked it – it’s stylish, sassy, compelling, and brings you into its world with little faff. It’s a lean experience; nowhere near as complex and unwieldy as the Dishonored series. And it takes you nowhere near long to complete, either. I think I wrapped up the Colt/Julianna storyline in a nice, easy 20 hours. Time enough to chew on it, digest the bits I enjoyed, and move on (Beacon Pines, I’m coming for you next).

As I downloaded this next quick completion, I read in Play Magazine that the upcoming alternate history jaunt of A Plague Tale: Requiem will clock in at under 20 hours, with  Asobo Studio’s lead level designer Kevin Pinson noting that the game will run about 15-18 hours, depending on how you play, with ‘no filler content’ padding it out. As I read this, my internal monologue provokes that timeless Gordon Ramsey quote: “Finally, some good fucking food.”
I played A Plague Tale: Requiem at Gamescom, and I loved it. The way it combines stealth with tactical movement, light puzzling with the grim reality of surviving in a world inundated with the plague (oh, wait) all comes together in this tight, intentional game that knows exactly where it’s going. And how it wants to get there.

Raicuparta shared a video of himself attempting Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in VR. The display inside the headset shows a first-person view of the titular Trombone Champ and the gameplay screen is projected in front of you. The game is played with motion controls, meaning you have to extend and retract your arm instead of moving a mouse back and forth for the correct notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fallout from Nvidia's RTX 4080/4090 reveal last week has been intense. We saw the reveal of the RTX 4090 - a phenomenal achievement in performance - backed by the debut of pioneering new technology like DLSS 3 frame generation, the remarkable RTX Remix and a new version of Cyberpunk 2077 that is to all intents and purposes running with full path-tracing. The technology is there to move PC gaming onto a new level but reaction to the keynote has instead been dominated by RTX 4080 pricing. Two RTX 4080s of very different spec levels are coming - priced at $899 and $1199 respectively - and based on reaction to Nvidia's own benchmarks, there's a performance gulf between them and an 'fps per dollar' deficit compared to prior gen-on-gen leaps.

The left-winger and lifelong reader of Rail magazine got his thumbs a-twiddlin’ for a special arcade version of the mod while at The World Transformed, a festival being held in Liverpool that celebrates radical politics, art, and culture. This is what he’s doing instead of singing God Save The King at the party conference then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a rumour for a while that Certain Affinity is working on a Halo Infinite battle royale, and the studio has recently promised that the project it is working on is "something big and new for the franchise."


Back in August of 2020, the Halo Infinite store page made a mention of a battle royale mode, and later that year a rumour emerged that suggested the game would in fact be receiving such a mode sometime in 2021. That obviously never happened, but frequent Halo assist studio Certain Affinity is working on something to do with Halo Infinite, and there are plenty of rumours that that is where the battle royale mode is being developed. And now, Certain Affinity executive Paul Sams has somewhat teased the project (thanks, Eurogamer).


"The biggest thing we're doing that's public right now, for more than two years now we've been working on Halo Infinite doing something that - they're very prescriptive about what we can say," Sams told VentureBeat. "But we're doing something unannounced, and we're doing lead development on that unannounced thing, from conception and design.

There hasn’t been an in-person E3 since 2019, and just one digital event bearing the E3 name has taken place since then. That’s a pretty big deal for a show that ran relatively unhindered for almost a quarter of a century. New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they're this site’s parent organisation.

Today, thanks to a huge article published by VG247 sibling, GI.biz, we've got a little more information on what E3 2023 will actually look like, this time around. And confirmation of dates. 
First up, the E3 2023 dates. For 2023, the show will return for a four-day expo from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16, 2023, and will feature separate industry and consumer days and spaces.

The LA-based show will open its doors for the first time since 2019 at its usual home of the Los Angeles Convention Centre, following mixed success as an online event in the interim. 


Next year will see the LACC's two main halls divided into separate spaces for industry attendees and those attending as fans - similar to how the various halls are separated at Gamescom.

Now, the Judgment Pierre Taki Restoration Patch finally brings the scrubbed actor back for the very first time, over here at least.

This activity was originally added to the game earlier this year, and adds a new storyline expanding upon the series' mysterious precursor Isu race, doled out by exploring a string of fun puzzle dungeons. 


It also allows for Eivor to come face-to-face with a series of British figures from history before her time - such as the ancient queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Fans have some interesting theories on who may pop up in this concluding set of dungeons (including someone perhaps more from Assassin's Creed lore than actual history itself).

It's a tale as old as time by this point, but difficult games, whether they be Dark Souls, Nioh, or an indie trying its own thing, often don't have any kind of difficulty options. Which isn't even touching on the related but separate issue of accessibility options. And now, Wo Long's producer Masaaki Yamagiwa has explained the decision behind not having any difficulty options in a recent interview.


Speaking to MP1st, Yamagiwa said "We're thinking it's 'good' to have one set difficulty so that everyone has the same experience of overcoming a really intense obstacle and they all have that feeling of achievement, like I did it. But the caveat there is giving players all different ways that they can do that."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming book focusing on all things Sable will be released to celebrate the game's one-year anniversary. 


Sable: Design Works will be the first instalment from publisher Lost in Cult's new series of indie-focussed art books. This particular release, which is due to launch in the second quarter of 2023, will feature interviews from those at developer Shedworks, as well as a "region-by-region insight" into the world of Midden and its art.


The book itself will be split into two different sections, one that "charts the development of Sable from its early concept and prototype, through its production, to launch" and one that focuses exclusively on the artwork and visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While much of AMD's briefings for the Ryzen 7000 desktop series were focused on gaming and other consumer workloads, one of the most exciting aspects for me with the Ryzen 7000 series is AMD now supporting AVX-512. But rather going for a 512-bit FPU data path and the possibility of reduced clock frequencies and power/thermal concerns, they employed a 256-bit "double pumping" strategy. When getting the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in the lab, exploring the AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 performance was one of the areas I was most excited to evaluate. From the benchmarks about to be shown, AMD's initial AVX-512 implementation is promising and has me all the more excited for finding it on AMD EPYC "Genoa" processors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 7000 processors are here, with a new 5nm process node and AM5 socket unlocking higher clock frequencies, greater power usage and in turn better performance. The four new CPUs releasing on September 27th also include a new 6nm I/O die, integrated graphics and support for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 - it's a substantial feature upgrade that reclaims parity with Intel's 12th-gen CPUs. 
Of course, features often come second to fps, so performance testing has comprised the bulk of our efforts. So far, two chips have crossed our desks - the $549/£579 Ryzen 9 7900X and $299/£319 Ryzen 5 7600X - and we've put them up against our assortment of hand-picked games and a sprinkling of productivity benchmarks too. The question we want to answer is simple: how do these Zen 4 designs perform against Intel's 12th-gen Core counterparts and AMD's older Ryzen 5000 lineup? 
The move to DDR5 also brings up a secondary question - what's the current RAM sweet spot for price/performance with Ryzen 7000? AMD suggest in their documentation that DDR5-6000 is the ideal right now, so we've tested their CPUs - and Intel's closest equivalents - at both 6000MT/s (AMD's recommendation) and 5200MT/s (where we did our Intel 12th-gen testing).

You know; those teeny, tiny little red bugs that could line-dance on a head of a pin and scurry along paving stones, looking like they couldn't hurt anything? Yeah. One of those. Emphasis on the "one", too, as this lad had been alone. And yet he'd taken one look at my sassy side ponytail and (correctly) presumed I was an easy target. Was it unexpected? You bet. Scary? Surprisingly so. Embarrassing? Yes. Very. 


Given I'm still on Day One of my survival journey I'd been hoping for a gentle tutorial period, but this bad boy had barrelled towards me, focused and unflinching, like a toddler locks onto a ball pit. A single thought flickers through my head: if these are the early enemies, what the hell are the strong ones like?!


The second time I cark it, I died of thirst. It wasn't that I ignored the instruction to get something to drink as much as I was distracted by the glorious wilderness – well, if you can call a suburban backyard the wilderness – and I didn't realise until the sun went down that I was missing the sap required to rustle up a torch. So, instead of creating a Lean To and hunkering down for the night, I huddled beneath the Kid Case spawn point instead – hotly aware of every slither and scuttle around me – and slowly expired of acute dehydration. Turns out that was more embarrassing than being walloped to death by the mite.

The developer - which has assisted with work on the Halo series from as far back as Halo 2 - was reported to be working on a new battle royale mode back in January. The following month, it issued a statement to confirm it was "deepening" its relationship with franchise holder 343 Industries. 


Now, Certain Affinity exec Paul Sams has said the studio's still-technically-unannounced project had been in the works for more than two years, with almost 100 staff working on it.

Front and centre was the Island Sanctuary: a farming life sim mode that offers a relaxing alternative to dungeon battling through duties and raids. That was on top of more main scenario and side quests, treasure hunts, housing options, and an extension of the Duty Support feature that lets players quest alone.


All of this variety is in line with producer and director Naoki Yoshida's idea of the ultimate MMORPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When developer Telltale Games launched the first season of its acclaimed and enormously influential The Walking Dead adaptation in 2012, it hit upon a choice-driven narrative formula the studio would rigidly adhere to across every one of its titles until its sad closure in 2018. Some found masterful ways to adapt that increasingly well-worn template, others were merely okay, but none were perhaps as odd, memorable, and quietly beloved as Tales from the Borderlands.


Tales from the Borderlands seemed like a bizarre, if not outright doomed, proposition from the off, attempting to marry Telltale's rich, character-driven formula to a puerile, open-ended looter shooter best known for its oodles of procedural guns. But against all the odds, it worked sublimely, the team at Telltale using the Borderlands series' loosely sketched canvas to deliver an experience that, for many who played it, proved to be not only the best Borderlands game, but Telltale's finest work - a five-part adventure that, largely free from the shackles of continuity and expectation, gleefully experimented with form and structure, melding dizzying invention and anarchic, unabashed silliness to something with surprising warmth and emotion.


And now, some eight years later, original Borderlands developer Gearbox is attempting to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of Tales from the Borderlands all over again.

But what if you were to throw a load of zombie-like monsters into this experience, and then proceed to turn out the lights, leaving the exit near impossible to find? Well, one developer has decided to answer that question in its upcoming game: The Store is closed.


The Store is Closed is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games' The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy (thanks, PCGamesN).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Potion Permit doesn't seem to do anything in a hurry, and that's because it's a game that expects you to be with it for a long time to come. It's a life simulation, really, dressed up as a potion making game. You're a chemist sent to a town to brew potions, but here's a house to decorate and machines to renovate, and here are townsfolk whose friendships you'll have to earn before they - and the services they offer - open up. Oh, and they have daily rhythms you'll have to adapt to and work around. Try and catch someone out of hours and they won't want to know: you'll have to wait until morning when they're officially on duty again. It all takes time.


The game unfolds mechanically in a very similar way, introducing new ideas slowly. After a couple of hours' play, I've only seen a few of what I suspect will be many gameplay ideas overall, and most of them mini-games. But the core idea is resource-gathering and crafting. 


When you're in the wilds, Potion Permit feels like an old-school action RPG, in that you hit enemies with a button-press and then roll around to dodge their attacks. You don't have to kill enemies - combat doesn't seem to be the point of the game - but you'll be attacked and enemies drop useful ingredients, so why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First spotted by Gematsu, it appears that a Silent Hill title — Silent Hill: The Short Message — has been rated in Korea. This particular game has not yet been announced by Konami, nor are any platforms for the title specified.
This rating has appeared rather unexpectedly, given that many of the most recent leaks were supposedly related to a remake of Silent Hill 2 or a playable teaser for some sort of mainline instalment. 
The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea, where Gematsu found the information about the rating, has the publisher for Silent Hill: The Short Message listed as UNIANA.

Nier: Automata Ver1.1a (because it wouldn't be a Nier piece of media if it didn't have some kind of weird name) received a lengthy trailer yesterday (September 24) showing off the anime in action for the first time, and even featured since insider details from Yoko Taro and the anime's director Ryoji Masayuma. It also confirmed a release date for the anime, which will be available to watch January 2023.


The trailer doesn't show off too much of the anime itself, but we do get to see what looks to be some of the early scenes of the game, which has a strong early 2000s vibe to the style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a recent report that discussed AI led voice acting, Hellblade developer Ninja Theory has clarified that it has no intentions to stop using real voice actors.


GLHF recently ran a report on AI voice acting, and how voice actors are concerned about losing their jobs to the technology. The piece in part focused on one such company working on this tech called Altered AI, and noted how Ninja Theory, currently working on Hellblade 2: Senua's Saga, is working with Altered AI, leading some to be concerned that the studio is replacing actual actors with AI. But Ninja Theory has put any of these concerns to bed with a recent tweet.


"No. For clarity, we use this AI tech for placeholder content only to help us understand things like timing and placement in early phases of development," wrote Ninja Theory in response to a Twitter user asking if the studio was in fact replacing real voice actors with AI. "We then collaborate with real actors whose performances are at the heart of bringing our stories to life."

Originally, the character model and voice for Judgement character Kyohei Hamura was based upon Japanese musician and actor Pierre Taki. Shortly after his drugs arrest, however, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios scrambled to replace him with the voice and likeness of Japanese actor Miou Tanaka instead.

Modder Timo 654, however, has brought Taki back to life - so to speak - by meticulously restoring the original voice lines and likeness.

Interestingly, Taro also revealed that due to the differences between storytelling via games and traditional mediums - and despite Aniplex's hopes of a faithful retelling of the game - the anime's story will differ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent job listing at Ubisoft seems to suggest that the Splinter Cell remake is being written with modern audiences in mind.


Last year, Ubisoft announced that a remake of the original Splinter Cell is in development, coming from the studio that developed Far Cry 6. Nothing has really been revealed since then, as is often par for the course when it comes to video game announcements. But as spotted by PlayStation Universe, we have more of an idea of how the game will be different from the original thanks to a recent scriptwriter job listing.


"Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience," reads the listing's description. "We want to keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable. As a scriptwriter at Ubisoft Toronto, you will join the narrative team and help create a cohesive and compelling narrative experience for a new audience of Splinter Cell fans."

According to SteamDB, the beta is currently sporting more concurrent players than Team Fortress 2, Destiny 2, GTA 5, and even Cyberpunk 2077, which has seen a boost in its own player numbers recently, too. 

With an all-time concurrent peak of 168,330 players (at the time of writing, anyway; it's been increasing steadily all weekend), that means it's already beaten the concurrent records for games like Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, The Division, FIFA 22, and Borderlands 2.

Plenty of games require you to do multiple playthroughs to see all of the story, and it sounds like Gotham Knights is no different. In a recent interview with PLAY magazine (as shared by MP1st), the game's director Geoff Ellenor explained how it is that you'll be able to see different parts of the story.


"You will not see all of it in a single playthrough," explained Ellenor, continuing to say "just because there’s so much content that is unique to the hero’s perception of what’s going on and what happened." Obviously Ellenor is referring to the fact that in Gotham Knights you can play as either Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood, or Robin, so it isn't too surprising to hear that each character will view things slightly differently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might not be a new game, but Sucker Punch has shown off some pretty nice looking merch for Sly Cooper's 20th anniversary.


Sorry to say that the words 'Sly Cooper' and 'announcement' aren't being paired together to reveal a surprise new title, but with the game's 20th anniversary having taken place on September 23, Sucker Punch did have some merch to show off, including a print, a t-shirt, and a plush of everyone's favourite sneaky raccoon.


The print is admittedly incredibly gorgeous, showing a cross section of a building with a tonne of wonderful details and references to the series. At the time of writing both  versions of the framed print are currently out of stock on the producer's website (Cook & Becker), as there were a limited number that were signed by artist Dev Madan, but it might be worth keeping an eye on anyway. But it is still available to pick up on the PlayStation Gear store.

Twitterer Shinobi602 - a games industry brand manager - found themselves intrigued enough by the sci-fi horror's most recent promotional video that they texted the number that pops up in the latest trailer.

After texting the number, Shinobi received a mysterious video response. The secretive teaser flashes words like "secrets, answers, ARCAS, lies" and ends with a date: 29th September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 looks to be doing pretty well for itself, as the game's player count on Steam has risen quickly following the release of Cyberpunk Edgerunners.


We probably all know by now that Cyberpunk 2077 didn't exactly launch in an amazing state. Whether it was the glitches, or the much delayed current-gen version of the game, things didn't really pan out until this year when the game actually saw a number of big fixes, and the current-gen version was actually released. Despite all of its problems though, at the time of writing Cyberpunk is sitting at a healthy 105,445 concurrent players (via SteamDB). Why? Through the power of anime, of course.


Cyberpunk Edgerunners, the anime spinoff of CD Projekt's take on the franchise from everyone's favourite Studio Trigger, launched last week, and has so far been pretty widely praised. And clearly fans have the Cyberpunk fever, because since the release of the anime, the average player count has been going up and up and up, hitting a peak of 122,376 players yesterday (September 24), which as PCGamesN points out is higher than The Witcher 3's all time Steam peak of 103,329.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following "reports of an issue with online servers". Although the publisher described the situation as "temporary", it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3's servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said "there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform" and revealed that it was "investigating the source of the problem", but the servers remained offline for several days.

        <updated>2022-09-25T11:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had no idea how important shareware was, and arguably still is, to the gaming industry until today. To me, shareware represented the few games I managed to play for free throughout the '90s. In particular, Duke Nukem 3D at lunchtime at Rupert Loman's house. (Rupert is the founder of Eurogamer/Gamer Network.) And there, in the corner of our screens, would be the little shareware reminder that we were playing an unregistered version of the game. But that wasn't a problem, it was legit, it wasn't pirated. We could keep playing for as long as we wanted. It's just that if we wanted more levels than the opening one, around the cinema - with the toilets you could wee into and the mirrors that actually reflected you (wow!) - then we'd have to pay for it. And I don't think any of us ever did.


But that was shareware: finding stuff for free. Or, at least, that's what it represented to me - I now realise I might have been part of the problem. But I was a teenager! I was broke. That's why I got sucked into Dope Wars with all of my other MSN Messenger buddies in 1998, buying and selling drugs at very competitive market prices (in a game!), and how I found an RPG called Dink Smallwood, which I remember vividly to this day. Does anyone else? I'm genuinely curious.


Really, though, shareware began a long, long time ago, though it can still be seen today (whisper it: "freemium"). And I learnt this from a new book called Shareware Heroes, written by Richard Moss. It attempts the daunting task of presenting a history of shareware by telling the stories of all the people involved in it. That's the equivalent of trying to follow all the separate threads in a bowl of spaghetti. But Moss, admirably, manages it.

The original Detective Pikachu game for 3DS, the inspiration behind the 2019 film of the same name, was announced to be receiving a sequel for Switch shortly after the film came out. And then we just… have not heard a single thing about the sequel since. But an eagle-eyed user on Famiboards noticed a mention of the game on developer Johnathon Murphy's LinkedIn page which suggests the game might not be too far off.


Famiboards user MetalLord shared a screenshot of Murphy's LinkedIn page, a developer who's been with Creatures Inc. since 2017 as a senior programer, a company that basically made all your favourite Pokémon spinoffs, and helps out on the main games. "Using Unity/C#, worked on one unannounced project and one nearing release, Detective Pikachu 2," reads the section of Murphy's experience at Creatures Inc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're finally going to get our first taste of the Super Mario Bros. film next month, as a teaser trailer is planned to premiere at New York Comic Con.


The official NYCC Twitter account announced earlier this week that the first teaser trailer for Nintendo and Illumination's Super Mario Bros. would be shown off at the convention, October 6, 4pm EST. It also finally confirmed a release date of April 7, 2023, as it had previously only been confirmed for a Spring release, after having been delayed from the holiday season this year.


Paired with the announcement is a very simple poster showing the classic question mark block on a black background, providing an elegance that Mario is perhaps not deserving of. No other details were given about the teaser trailer, and the announcement certainly didn't mention if we're going to hear the voice of Mario himself, Chris Pratt.

Clarke wanted to use a powerful god or mythological character for the name and that is somehow the RAMA series started.
Now the first book in the series explores an extraterrestrial spaceship that earth people see/connect with. The spaceship is going somewhere and is doing an Earth flyby so humans don’t have much time to explore the spaceship and it is difficult to figure out how the spaceship worked. The spaceship is around 40 km. long. They don’t meet any living Ramans but mostly automated syste…]]></summary>

I was lucky that I'd typically receive a game for my birthday and for Christmas, but the rest of the year, games were expensive and out of reach through any other method than renting. It was the 1990s and the idea of cheap digital downloads to stave off the lack of games seemed unfathomable. 


The advantage to renting games is I had the opportunity to experience many more games than I ever would have risked asking for as a gift. The disadvantage? The competition involved in acquiring the game I was after.


That was the case with not-quite-Zelda-clone-but-it-is-basically Story of Thor on the Mega Drive. In many ways, competing for a copy of Story of Thor, also known as Beyond Oasis, was harder than actually playing the game. My local Blockbuster (remember those? No? Oh) had two copies. It looked thrilling. It had one of those newer Mega Drive boxes that had a thick blue line down the side of it. On the one hand, that meant that the game would have superior graphics and other bits and pieces. On the other hand, that meant the Mega Drive was getting a bit long in the tooth and my days of owning the latest console were very numbered. To put it into context, in Europe, Story of Thor came out the same year as the PlayStation 1 launched. Change was coming. Fast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article originally went out to Eurogamer supporters as part of the Eurogamer Essentials newsletter that goes to all members every Friday. If you'd like to find out how to become a Eurogamer supporter you can find out more here.

If' there's anything as fascinating is the incubation of a triple-A game - something exposed in spectacular fashion last weekend by the GTA 6 drama, with leaks that stripped away the gloss and exposed the wheels and cogs (as well as the ignorance of how exactly video games are made, something we could all do a better job of educating each other on) - it's the afterlife of a modern-day blockbuster. Even better when it's one as derided as Cyberpunk 2077 was at launch. 
Why exactly CD Projekt's sci-fi spectacular was the subject of such ire when it launched at the tail-end of 2020 is a topic too multifaceted to properly unpick with the 600 or so words we have here; there was some righteous anger about the appalling working conditions Cyberpunk 2077 was made under at times, a hype cycle that even the most accomplished of games would buckle under, a more than messy launch as it awkwardly straddled two generations of hardware and, ultimately, a good old-fashioned pile-on that obscured all else. There’s rarely room for nuance in internet discourse, and the noise around Cyberpunk 2077’s launch is proof perfect of that.

In a joint statement, the partnership said that despite 1.3 billion women and girls making up half of the global game's community – 60 per cent of whom started gaming before turning 13 – 60 per cent of "girl gamers" polled by Dove "feel misrepresented and recognise a lock of diversity as a key issue in video games".

35 per cent of young girls also reported that their "self-esteen is negatively impacted after seeing a lack of diversity in characters and avatars".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hellblade developer Ninja Theory has disputed claims that it uses AI technology to replace voice actors in its games, saying it only uses AI-generated voice work for "placeholder content".

Ninja Theory was named by GLHF as a company that utilises the services of Altered AI, a tech firm that supports studios in creating "compelling, professional voice performances" via AI rather than professional – and real – voice actors. 

The report stopped short of revealing the minutiae of the arrangement, however, stating that "the details of their partnership are under wraps".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PUBG Mobile has released a new anti-cheat system that it says has already cut cheating by half.

Developer Krafton says the system, called Fog of War, "helps mask the movements of other players from cheaters using x-ray vision/wall hacks", and states that during the testing period, cheating fell by 62 per cent in "certain regions".  

"The first of its kind in mobile gaming, Fog of War is an advanced anti-cheat system that limits the game information a player receives, reducing their ability to see players out of their field of view or through walls and objects," Krafton explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life can be a lot less bother when you hover. Think of Exile, the 1988 marvel that cleverly crams an entire alien world and its belligerent fauna into the scrawny 32k memory of a BBC Micro. Chief among the game's chaotic pleasures is its nifty jetpack, empowering your stranded space captain to explore the hostile planet Phoebus and its clever tangle of interlocking physics systems. 
As modes of transport go, jetpacks are often more about pluck than precision. In Exile you are engaged in a constant push-pull with unhelpful gas geysers, explosive shockwaves and the invisible tug of Phoebus gravity. But rocketing around at high speed in low-roofed caverns chimes perfectly with a game that asks you to jump headfirst into the unknown and apply seat-of-the-pants problem-solving. Exile's rocket-powered emergent slapstick makes me smile the same way I do when seeing a jelly start to wobble: precariousness as pleasure. It is undoubtedly my second-favourite video game jetpack. (In keeping with the subject matter, please strap in and allow me to loop around in some discursive aerobatics before revealing my actual favourite.)
It is a boost universally acknowledged, then: jetpacks rule. They have ruled since the early 20th century, when they first propelled space cowboys like Buck Rogers into high adventure via lowbrow pulp novels and comic strips. For decades these portable domesticated explosions were sleek symbols of a seemingly imminent tech-assisted future, gleaming pointers toward a world where humanity would be free to blast off at will into the Y-axis while flicking V-signs at boring old gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deathloop has finally appeared on Xbox Series consoles. The time-travelling caper from Microsoft-owned Arkane Studios debuted as a PS5 and PC release last September - a time-limited console exclusive owing to a pre-acquisition agreement with Sony. That original PS5 release had some flaws but has been patched since release with additional content, visual fixes, and a new 120fps graphics mode.

Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don't usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it's a fun silly idea; 2) it's very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that.

Journalist Matthew Keys tweeted that a source has told him that the teenager’s detainment was related to the Rockstar hack and another involving Uber. Keys claimed that the suspect is connected to hacking group Lapsus$, which organises through Telegram channels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 17 year old was arrested in Oxfordshire yesterday, due to the suspicions of hacking. According to journalist Matthew Keys and sources who spoke to them, they were allegedly involved in the GTA 6 hack that resulted in a major information leak last weekend, and are also connected to a prior hack on Uber. This source also claims that the arrest was made by London City police in collaboration with the FBI.
In terms of information that has been confirmed, the London City Police has come forward and announced an arrest has been made in Oxfordshire as part of an ivnestigation by the NCA UK's National Cyber Crime Unit. Currently in police custody, there is currently no confirmation made by the police whether they were arrested for the GTA 6 hack, although according to journalist Matthew keys an additional statement by the London City Police will be released later today. A statement from the FBI may also be released soon.
The hacker responsible for the GTA 6 had earlier in the week publicised that they were looking to make a "deal" with Rockstar (thanks Gamebyte), but since then things have gone quiet. Rockstar Games did come out to confirm that the leaked assets were legitimate, leading to an influx of industry support and numerious other devs posting their own early game builds to show that the GTA 6 that the world could see thanks to the leaks wasn't likely to resemble the final product.

think in time of Debian General Resolutions (GRs). And even if we
didn’t, vote lists were open (except when voting for people,
i.e. when electing a DPL), so if interested we could understand what
our different peers thought.
This is the first vote, though, where a Debian vote is protected under
voting secrecy. I think
it is sad we chose that path, as I liken a GR vote more with a voting
process within a general assembly of a cooperative than with a
countrywide voting one; I feel that understanding who is behind each

This range consists of a Sly plushy (seen in the header image), a print of some anniversary artwork by the original Sly Cooper's art director Dev Madan and an anniversary T-shirt.


The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While everyone knows that Classic World of Warcraft is undergoing a heap of hype surrounding the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, for good reason too, there are plenty of reasons to get excited, Brewfest is a great opportunity for loot and laughs right now. It is, however, also an opportunity for cheeky people to try and scam some extra loot from under the noses of their fellow adventurer. Such are the joys of Classic WoW.
But first, what is Brewfest. For those not in the know, Brewfest is a one-per-year limited time event where players can buy some drinks, get smashes, and get some exclusive rewards. It’s unsubtly based on the German holiday Octoberfest, and features a variety of events and tasks for players to complete if they so wish.
It also has a special boss fight — Corren Direbrew — in the Blackrock Depths, which in turn can provide some truly illustrious loot. These could be powerful trinkets, special toys that allow quick transfer to the dungeon, and even two very rare mounts with roughly a 1% drop-rate from Corren. Since right now players are gearing up characters for the next expansion, an even greater number of players than usual are jumping in for a chance at some handy shinies in this already bustling activity.

Since I've recently returned from a visit to the UK, and caught COVID-19 while I was there, I figured I'd see if my brain was fried by adding macro support.
I know lisp macros are awesome, it's one of those things that everybody is told.  Repeatedly.    I've used macros in my emacs programming off and on for a good few years, but despite that I'd not really given them too much thought.
If you know anything about lisp you know that it's all about the lists, the parenthesis, and the macros.  Here's a simple macro I wrote:
 (define if2 (macro (pred one two)
    `(if ~pred (begin ~one ~two))))

The standard lisp if function allows you to write:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the 16 and 64-bit eras, UK-based developer Rare was exceptionally good at looking at what its then almost-parent Nintendo was doing, then developing their own killer take on it. I mean, seriously, look at the evidence – Diddy Kong Racing gives Mario Kart 64 a run for its money, but is awash with way, way more content. Banjo Kazooie is right up there with Super Mario 64. And one of the great pieces of gaming gossip of the 90s revolves around Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto’s alleged distaste at the wild success of Donkey Kong Country. Rare and Nintendo were on the same side, but were in a quiet sort of rivalry that resulted in some really damn good games. 

Star Fox Adventures is another game in that pantheon – and as I reconsidered this unique little tile as it turns 20 years old, I realized two things: first, the march of time is crushing and I feel ancient. Second: this is sadly the last great Star Fox game, at least for now.
Which is funny when you think about it, as Star Fox Adventures didn’t even begin life as a Star Fox game. It was originally announced as Dinosaur Planet, an original Rare property that was basically the company doing for the Ocarina of Time formula what Banjo-Kazooie did to Mario 64’s take on 3D platforming. It starred dual protagonists, a fox and a wolf, but after Miyamoto saw the game in action, he made a suggestion: why didn’t it just use Star Fox? Thus the game changed forms, and then platform – jumping from a surprisingly complete N64 build to a massive do-over on GameCube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week's offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn't Ark: Survival Evolved's first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you're a survival fan who hasn't yet given it a look, it's still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark's base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic's freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game's rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having kids is wonderful when it's not the most tiring, life-changing thing you can do to yourself – and even then you only remember the wonderful bits. When your child smiles at you for the first time and it isn't a build up of gas... wonderful. When your child says "dada" not as part of a string of completely random sounds... wonderful. When your child laughs at you for doing something only they would laugh at... wonderful.
As I said, it's not always wonderful. Waking up four times a night... not wonderful. Standing in a stress position to hold the hands of a tiny child trying to walk... not wonderful (but also wonderful). Constantly tidying things that are never actually tidy... not wonderful.
But if there's one thing that sums up having young children it's this: It's 4pm on a Saturday. Essentially the evening if you're a parent. It's a little too early for dinner, but you at least know that that's soon and then after that bed time isn't far off. The sweet release of bed time. Anyway, you see a crumb of chocolate just sat in a crevice of your shirt. Given that dinner, as established is still some minutes away, you fancy a small snack. Yum! Chocolate. But you've forgotten, just for a split-second, that you have a baby.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Edgerunners shows everyone how a great anime tie-in should be done. With awesome animation and key aesthetic twinkles that ground the action in the Cyberpunk universe, there’s enough for newcomers to drink in while also letting franchise devotees nod sagely along to the show feeling very clever as it ticks off the all the cool things they’ve seen in-game – now that’s fan service. 


If adapting something beloved is difficult, then adapting something with a dodgy rep should be even harder.


For all its genuine merits, Cyberpunk 2077 overpromised, launched in an unacceptable state on console and bore the price – even my Mum asked me about it getting yanked from PlayStation after she heard about it on mainstream breakfast news.

Creative director Davide Soliani was initially told Rabbids were not to speak by Ubisoft. However, thanks to some creative manipulation of the rules and a successful bid by Soliani to "gain trust" from Ubisoft, Mario and his Rabbid companions will now talk during their upcoming escapades (thanks, IGN).


Let's rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has finally released a shiny new revamp of their old stats page, so that us data nerds can track the most popular, most financially lucrative, and most played PC games on Steam in one new webpage. Available for anyone and everyone right now, you no longer have to check out a dated site or third party alternatives.
Announced via a blog post earlier today, a variety of info on each game and their placement on respective rankings such as recent changes in position, options to quickly switch regional toggles, and the ability to see total revenue. All in all, a handy tool!
Those who have been around for a while, and people who have tried to look up this sort of information may have popped by the old stats page or websites like Steam Spy or Steam Charts (yes, there was a Steam Charts before this announcement, confusingly enough). It was possible to get a good idea of certain data points via these websites (some of which would pull information from the Steam API) That being said, having a new flashy place to grab this kind of data from an official source does make the process a whole lot easier.

I wasn’t planning to focus so much on Shadows of Doubt, and I will be doing a proper preview in the coming weeks, but I cannot stress this enough – it’s brilliant. Rarely does such a bold vision enjoy being matched by its execution. It reminds me somewhat of Cloudpunk, which I really enjoyed, but I desperately wanted to have a less passive relationship with the city itself. With it’s striking sense of immersion and a commitment to granular interactivity built into the game’s core design, I feel like Shadows of Doubt very much achieves that aspiration for me. I can’t wait until the full version comes out next year. It won ‘UK Game of the Show’ at Gamescom a few weeks ago, and it’s blindingly obvious why …]]></summary>

Solidigm is the US company formed when SK Hynix acquired Intel's NAND/SSD business. Since forming Solidigm at the end of last year they have continued to sell products from Intel's existing SSD product line-up while last month they announced the P41 Plus as their first consumer solid-state drive of their own design. Recently I've been testing out the Solidigm P41 Plus 1TB and 2TB drives under Linux for seeing how these affordable QLC drives perform.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neil Druckmann, the man behind the gritty The Last of Us games, has a cameo in the delightful, and comparatively very colourful, Return to Monkey Island. 


Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


"Neil Druckmann?" my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dicebreaker Recommends is a series of monthly board game, RPG and other tabletop recommendations from our friends at our sibling site, Dicebreaker. This month, we look at a one of the best two-player board games released in recent memory. 
There's nothing quite like a two-player board game to stoke the fires of competition. Two-player board games are great in that they offer the kind of uniquely competitive experience that no other type of tabletop title can provide - and Sobek: 2 Players is a prime example of this.  
A recent remake/reimagining of a 2010 card game, Sobek: 2 Players takes the concept of the original – players are merchants attempting to make a tidy profit in an Ancient Egyptian market – and turns it into a more focused version, ditching the two to four-player count for a one-on-one experience.

As you may have surmised from the headline already, this page sees all of Steam's top games bundled together in one place. It will replace the usual Steam Stats many of you may be familiar with.


"Today we're launching Steam Charts, a new section of Steam that is dedicated to showing the most-played and top-selling games on Steam. Including numbers in real time," Valve said in a statement (thanks, Kotaku).

It's only available for those who pre-ordered or acquired a beta code so far, but it's already breaking records.
Everyone assumed it was going to be big, but since Call of Duty has been absent from Steam for five years now, we never really had a good picture of its player numbers on PC. Modern Warfare 2 marks the series' grand return to Steam, and the audience there has responded in kind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase's plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It's in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an 'isometric/top-down' perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google's Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can't be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do "love exploring". The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft Classic is getting a massive update with the Wrath of the Lich King expansion on September 26. It’s a bit of a big deal, especially for the thousands of players who have been grinding out Alterac Valley or farming professions over the past few weeks. To celebrate the occasion, a new trailer has been released on the official World of Warcraft Youtube channel, and it’s absolutely perfect.
You can watch it yourself below, but for some context this wasn’t created by the usual team of talented CGI artists who put out stunning cinematics for expansions (like the excellent Dragon Isle trailer). Instead, it comes from fan creator Hurricane, who has previously been responsible for a range of custom mind-blowing raid trailers.
In the trailer, you can see all the major features of the Wrath of the Lich King launch, including the scourge invasion of Azeroth, players arriving to the various Northrend zones and battling various monsters you can find there, taking on dungeons and of course some Wintergrasp PvP. All of this is a machinima, made with a variety of in-game assets and custom VFX. For an idea of the sort of work that goes into trailers like this, you can check out a short breakdown video of a previous Black Temple trailer here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we're discussing video game leaks, following last weekend's devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

After that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an "insider" Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft. Join Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan for their thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Microsoft starts to feel more heat from regulatory bodies over its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, CEO Satya Nadella has said he's "very confident” the deal will go through.


Governmental scrutiny of Microsoft's acquisition has grown in recent weeks, with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority announcing it was moving to a more in-depth "phase 2" of its investigation, having determined the acquisition would give rise to the "realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services."


Sony, too, has grown increasingly vocal over the proposed deal, particularly as it pertains to potential console exclusivity around the likes of Call of Duty. Early this month, for instance, PlayStation head Jim Ryan called Microsoft's reassurances that the hugely popular shooter would remain on PS5 post-acquisition "inadequate".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most integral parts to any good FIFA game, aside from the football, is the soundtrack.


A running theme around the FIFA community is that every new game introduced players to their next favourite tune. And as the years go by, the tracks serve as a nostalgia trip to playing FIFA after a long day of school or work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Techland has announced another delay for Bloody Ties, Dying Light 2's long-awaited first chunk of story DLC, which is now expected to arrive on 10th November.


Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2's five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the "epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour". Here, they'll find "challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover."


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solium Infernum – the cult classic turn-based strategy PC game that astounded players when it landed back in 2009 – is finally making its return in 2023, per a new trailer released by developer League of Geeks at EGX this week.
The demonic turn-based experience is coming back for modern gamers, and it's got a new developer attached this time around – it's been reimagined by Armello creators, League of Geeks, and will arrive complete with all-new single-player scenarios and scheme-in-your-sleep asynchronous multiplayer matches, to boot.

As with the original release, the new game will require you to deploy cunning moves and political wit in order to outplay your opponents and reign supreme. The game has been modernized and built in 3D with a totally updated visual interface, bringing in the lessons League of Geeks has learned from Armello when it comes to "unique and acclaimed aesthetic and production values".
